            "review": "I thought this place was sort of a rip off.  We were approached by someone outside the entrance about 'free cover' even though there was no cover to pay.  It was all kinds of creepy.\n\nThe Foursquare page for this bar says that there are drink specials for people who check in (and the specials are listed on the page).  When I approached the bar tender and showed him my phone, he was a big dick about the special and said it wasn't real.  He was angry at me and said that they weren't in charge of that page (apparently someone hijaked it and was making things up?).  I wasn't really pleased with the guy's attitude and then he was a dick to my group for the rest of the night.\n\nService is super, super slow (especially if you're outside) so don't bother staying here for a few drinks.  By the time you're done with your first one, you'll be so bored that you want to leave and go somewhere else for more drinks.\n\nThe drinks are also obviously pretty expensive and they only have standard cocktails (nothing unique or new).  Beer is insanely expensive and my Coors wasn't even cold when they brought it out.\n\nThe only good thing about this place is the view, which is pretty stunning of the strip."

The view from the balcony is amazing. The food was absolutely delicious. I am sorry that I don't remember what I had so that I could describe it but I can honestly say it was a purely enjoyable meal. To be honest, I was more satisfied with the night life and view in the other room afterwards.. \n\nDefinitely check this place out if you have never been and appreciate a nice view."

            "review": "This has to be one of the most beautifully decorated restaurants I have ever set foot in.  Its almost like you're dining in a bottle of champagne- they have thousands of hollow glass balls suspended from strings hanging from the ceiling all over the restaurant.  The whole room is white- and there are HUGE windows that provide some spectacular views.  They also have these futuristic booths you can sit in called \"pods\", that are large white circular, capsule-type booths that provided for a really private and intimate dining experience.  \n\nI'm going to have to disagree with a lot of reviews on Mix- the food IS worth the high price.  Don't come to a fine dining establishment in Vegas and bitch about the price- you simply should have known better.  Its not like they're serving bad food, people. \n\n I chose the curried lobster dish- their signature.  It was extremely flavorful and delicious- not an overpowering curry taste at all.  The mac and cheese was OK...it was actually better at 3am that night once it had cooled down a bit.  When it was served fresh it was a little soupy.  My bf chose a filet, and he was happy with the quality of the steak and the temperature it was cooked to.  We also got a crab appetizer which was kind of boring.  All in all, this restaurant is solid- great service, great food, and a crisp, fresh ambiance."

Must be for weekends. \n- higher floor than GHOSTBAR + VOODOO! 60 something vs. 55 something!\n- better view than GHOSTBAR + VOODOO! closer view and you get to see down the strip!\n- pretty pictures! take shots of north and south! Instagram! \n- Plenty of seating. Grab a drink and mingle ~\n- Last Call! I actually heard it. I thought that term didn't exist in vegas. \n- 3 mens bathroom stalls. piss while looking at the beautiful skyline\n- no dookies. sorry guys, no toilets.\n- Small dance floor. You got a rainbow circle to crowd under. \n- Great music. Great tone for a luxurious venue.  \n- BEST skyline vegas lounge I've been to thus far."

            "review": "miX Lounge on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay offers the best open-air panoramic views of the Las Vegas Strip. It opens at 5:00 p.m. and the night views are stunning. The restaurant and bar offer an upscale casual way to impress your date or your own eyes with all the lights & sparkles of Vegas over 400 feet below.\n\nOlivia Z. and me stopped in miX before hitting the Michael Jackson ONE show cause it is very convenient to the theater. We were lucky cause there was no cover charge on Christmas Eve. After a quick ride up an express elevator, we eagerly hit the balcony to take in the mesmerizing view. Bring a camera and smiles.\n\nAfter snapping a few pics, we headed inside and grabbed a seat at one of the many tables facing out. A waitress popped over in just a few seconds and our first round of drinks was on their way. miX Lounge is dark, but the menu is backlit and kind of cool. The faux leather seats and aluminum tables actually seem cool, too. \n\nOlivia started with a miXOPOLITAN ($16) with Absolut Citron, Cointreau, White Cranberry, Candied Lemon, and a string of Fresh Cranberries. It was sweet and refreshing at the same time. For round two, she switched to a Pear Martini ($18) recommended by the waitress. It features Grey Goose La Poire, Champagne, St. Germain, and a Pear Slice. Much like Olivia, this was even sweeter than the first drink. She liked them both.\n\nFor me, I was recovering from the previous night's drinking binge and stuck with some beers. Both were fine and $9: Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and Sierra Nevada Kellerweis.\n\nThis review is strictly for the miX Lounge (not miX Restaurant) and the beautiful views from the outdoor patio.\n - Service was stellar. \n - Drinks were decent.\n - The vibe was cool.\n - The view was dazzling.\n\nIt's time to add miX Lounge to the mix of must see attractions in Las Vegas."

Mix has a better view than even Mandalay Bay's Foundation Room (which is partially angled towards the airport).\n- It was a corporate party and so an open bar.  The Mix server making the drinks was professional and nice.\n- Would love to come back here with a date to take in the view over drinks."

            "review": "This review is strictly on the Lounge, not the restaurant (they should probably be categorized separately):\nThis place is a mystery to me. It has a phenomenal view of the strip and a cool vibe inside yet every time I am there its pretty empty. Maybe I am going on the wrong nights, maybe at the wrong times, but for as many times as I have gone up there I find it hard to understand how it's always so empty. The view is everything for me. It brings MiX from an average lounge to a 4 star lounge. It could use some T.L.C. and I'm not talking about the R&B group (\"creep\" is their best song by the way).\nIt needs a refresh inside and I wish the patio was a bit wider. It's a shame to have that beautiful view and such a small patio (advantage Foundation Room). The decor and furniture is modern and fun but could also be updated a bit. The black paint inside could definitely be updated and changed to something more friendly and appealing.\nThey have a relatively small dance floor but it is encased by floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip so I would say that makes up for it.\nI don't really know what else to say here. I never really stay very long when I go to MiX. It's usually just drop in for a drink and take in the view to show some friends in town and then go on to another place. I had a hard time giving them 4 stars but I feel that 3 is too low. It's a shame because it has 5 star potential. I really hope that they invest some money into improving or re-branding MiX."

It was free cover for locals which is how it should be.\nOnce you get off the elevator the view takes over. Its such a fantastic view of the city.\nThey have a nice balcony that had the heaters cranking since it was chilly out.\nThe music was typical club music..there seemed to be a bit more hip hop being played but that was ok since there were some sista's on the dancefloor that were working it hard. It was very entertaining to say the least.\nWe had a good time & would come back again."

            "review": "Came for our last night in Vegas for a romantic meal. The view (and decor) was absolutely incredible and hands down worth coming for at least a round of drinks in the lounge. However, we weren't too satisfied with the restaurant experience. The waiter we had was snooty (perhaps assuming young clientele = cheap tippers?) and talked down to us. We tried to get past it, but it left a lasting impression on us. Despite the service, we had a pretty good meal. We ordered the lobster Caesar salad and gnocchi, both were fairly good. For my entree, I got the Wagyu beef, which came as a pot roast and wasn't what I was expecting for a fine dining meal. Husband got the curry lobster dish, which was very good. We capped it off with a bottle of wine in the lounge and views overlooking the strip at night. Bottom line, come for drinks, but skip the food."

We had the bigeye tuna appetizer and it was so light and flavorful( I am not a seafood person and even I enjoyed it!). The bread service was so fresh and served with a delicious home made peanut butter(butter with peanuts mixed in). He ordered the cod and wild mushroom side and I ordered the pepper crusted filet minion with fork crushed potatoes, every bite from all of these dishes was amazing! The service was wonderful and very attentive. After dinner we went to the lounge and enjoyed the beautiful views with delicious and strong drinks. We will be back when we are in town and encourage others to enjoy this place."

The food was less than stellar, and the $250 bill for 2 sort of put a damper on the rest of the evening, for which I was really annoyed. If you are looking for great French food in an upscale environment, try Bouchon at the Venetian.  I must give props to the wait staff, who are actually very cool and well informed, I think they were embarrassed about the quality of the food versus the price."

We had two different waiters and both were so great - really helpful, sense of humour. The sommelier was really helpful and patient choosing wine. \n\nFood-wise: The shrimp cocktail is awesome, and NOT your usual shrimp cocktail (it almost ends up being more like a salad.) The lobster curry sounds crazy but it's fantastic (we ordered one with our entrees, for everyone to share!), and the wagyu beef stew is soooo good - I don't know why they bother giving you a knife, it falls apart. They also do this crazy dessert cocktail that has this foam on top - it's like a passionfruit/peach type thing. So amazing. \n\nIt's not the cheapest place to grab dinner, but well worth it. We have so enjoyed our two trips and will definitely be going back. A must, if you're in Vegas."

            "review": "At the top of THE Hotel (not Mandalay Bay like some suggested) my party of ten dined here for a bachlorette/bday party weekend. Of the entire experience, I was most impressed with Mix lounge, which offers amazing views of the Strip and tasty cocktails in an outdoor/indoor lounge. I enjoyed a great lemon drop martini while waiiting to be seated. \n\nHere's where the stars begin to drop off. I was a bit thrown when the hostess at Mix said that they would not come get our party at the lounge or even give us some sort of beeper for when our table was ready. We came back for our 8:30 reservation (at 8:30) and ended up waiting 15 minutes while other parties where seated. It took a while for the hostess to even acknoledge us. It also seemed odd for a high-end, busy restaurant to only have one hostess.\n\nOur table had two servers which was a bit confusing, especially since one server was great and the outher was lousey. The lousely server pointed out that we had (by mistake) ordered a half bottle for the table but when we asked for recommendations for a full bottle, he simply offered a name \"under the Oregon section\" and walked away. Doesn't seem much of a helpful recommendation, espcially with such an extensive wine list. It took a bit to thumb through and actually find the section where this wine was listed. \n\nTo start the meal the table shared a plated of toast and meats with mustard and the ahi tuna with mango. The ahi was very good and small (I'd suggest the full order). The toast and meats plates certainly had toast...which was burnt black. The clever cook turned the burnt parts inward towards each other so the bread looked ok from the outside. The black toast was sent back.\n\nDinner was just ok. The majority of the table ordered pepper-crusted med-rare filets with sides. My steak came out visably medium, which I addressed to the 'good' waiter's attention. I ended up just eating it since it would have taken too long to re-order and my sides would have been cold. I tried the forked mashed potatoes, which were fine, as well as the wild mushrooms, which were also fine. Nothing mind-blowing. If your steak is lacking it's hard to get excited about the sides. \n\nOur fun waiter, though, was actually a blast. He was a \"retired\" chip-and-dales dancer that even did a spin and body roll to amuze the table while taking away our toast. You can't make this up!\n\nHe brought us a free pasion fruit dessert drink with coconut foam..which was amazing! I wish this was on the menu! He also served us fresh macaroons from the baking sheet with sides of nutella to end the meal (also complementary). While our one server came though, I'd say from the food experience, I wouldn't come back. Too many good food choices in Vegas to blow a couple hundred bucks on a meal here. I'll definitly be back for the lounge."

So I decided to check out Mix for my first time. Expecting it to be like Foundation Room, it was anything but! \n\nSpectacular view of the strip and what's best about it is unlike any other venue I've seen at high altitude in Vegas, you get a great view indoors thanks to the window pane which extends the entire wall facing the strip. This is great for those nights when the weather isn't so good. You can also stand out in the balcony if you like as well. \n\nThe vibe inside was great, a little bit of an older crowd, I'd definitely recommend  this place to those in their 30's and up. DJ did a great job in playing music for the crowd. \n\nMy only complaint was service was a little slow at the bar despite the fact that their wasn't a line. But the staff at the door was awesome and the GM was very hospitable. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a hidden gem in Vegas!"

An employee said we could go sit in the lounge and they would come get us. Our reservation was at 6. It was 6:15, and no one came to the lounge so we yet again had to find someone to help us. We finally get seated and the server asks us if we had a show to catch. We told her no but I wish we had said yes because they were SO slow. We were literally there almost 3 hours! I understand we had the pre fixe dinners, but 3 hours is excessive. \n\nWe each got a different pre fixe meal - the $90 and the $120 one and decided we would share everything. If I am paying over $100 pp person for dinner, I expect it to be good - DAMN GOOD. What a disappointment.

We could not put our finger on it but if whatever it was, was left it, it would have probably tasted a lot better. \n\nButternut Squash Ravioli - pretty good\n\nSeared Diver Scallops - these were also very good\n\nLamb - was actually the best lamb I've ever had although the eggplant whatever else was in the side dish that came with it was disgusting and I love eggplant. \n\nTender Potato Gnocchi - this wasn't bad\n\nLobster \"Au Curry\" - I think the way it was prepared ruined the dish. Had the rice and the lobster been separate dishes it would have been much better. I ended up eating them separately so as to not ruin the taste of the lobster. Lobster is good as it is, why try and dress it up just to ruin it? \n\nFilet Minion - very good. Cooked perfectly. \n\nBoth desserts were very good. \n\n2 dinners, 2 light beers and 2 mixed drinks made our bill come out to $375, which included gratuity. Luckily we had a $50 certificate from restaurant.com and we had comps from our players card so we ended up paying $130 out of pocket. Had we paid more, I would have been really unhappy. Our meal wasn't even worth the $130 we paid. I admit the view is amazing and they have some good options for dinner, but I say if you want to see the view, go to the lounge, see the view and then leave. There are a million other places in Vegas where you could spend much less and get a MUCH better meal!"

If it's not too hot outside you can request an outside table that has the best view of the strip. I got a $50 discount so it was a lot more affordable. Cocktails are about $16 each, so if you want to save money go for a glass of wine or no alcohol. I wrote about how I got my discount in my blog if you want more info letsjetset.com."

Probably one of the few spots I'm lucky to have perused in this trip, Mix Lounge at THEHotel was a treat.\n\nAs you ride the elevator up to heaven (there were many floors), you immediately feel the sensual, trendy vibe of the place. It must be the evening neon lighting and candles everywhere...makes one feel like they've retired inside some lava lamp.\n\nBe sure to take out some of next semester's college tuition for this venue because it may be quite expensive for some of you and the food they serve here is very light, minimal but the taste is exquisite! One of those meals where you savor every bite because you only have 1 or 2 bites to go but all had such a distinct taste that defines refined cuisine flavor. Cool spot to check out every once in awhile you're vacationing\n\nEnjoyed the...\nBLUEFIN TUNA TARTARE\nGUACAMOLE & PLANTAIN CHIPS\nSEARED DUCK FOIE GRAS\nDAIKON CONFIT AND BEETS, PORT REDUCTIO\n\nEach were $20 and above. \n\nSit yourself down in one of the lounge chairs out in the veranda and take a slow scan of the overwhelming yet breathtaking view of Las Vegas. The view is to die for and which I find more captivating but just as pleasant as in Moon nightclub in the Palms\n\nSpeaking of \"moon\", head on over to the bathrooms, be daring and grace Sin City with a view of you taking care of business...peek-a-boo"

The DJ was playing some decent house music. \nGot a Whiskey on ice ($10) and two martinis ($13 each) and hit the patio to enjoy the view. \nIt was a pretty hot night, so the patio felt like a damn sauna, but we hung out for a little while and enjoyed the view of the whole city. \nAfter a little while, the DJ decided to switch up her playlist from house to rap from the 90's (as far back as 2Pac - \"I get around\"). \nThe girls wanted to dance, so we grabbed some more drinks and went to the little dance floor. It can't be more than 20x20, and I don't think there's a sound system/speakers there, but we still had a good time. \nBartenders were all cool, and so was the crowd, and since we were there so early (from around 11:30 to 1a), there wasn't a wait for drinks. \nIf you're looking to have a chill night, come here.....or you can start off your night here before heading out to one of the other clubs."

The theme of the restaurant is quite simple yet classy. The restaurant is divided into two different areas. One side is black. Like everything from the walls to the furniture is black. The bar area is red and the kitchen and a private dining table is located in the middle. On the other side it's completely different. Everything from the walls to the furniture is white. It's so classy and elegant and also offers spectacular views of the Las Vegas Strip. \n\nThe menu at MIX is a very upscale dining menu. They offer quality foods such as caviar, foie gras, lobster and filet mignon. I came here for a couple different events so I didn't get the chance to try things off of the menu. \n\n==SERVICE==\nThe service here at MIX was great. The host was pretty cute and all of the cocktail waitresses were very friendly. They had plenty of servers coming around and delivering hors d'oeuvres. \n\n==FOOD==\nThey had different hors d'oeuvres such as chicken satay, sliders, shrimps, beef skewers, caprese skewers and more. The entrees were filet mignon with scalloped potatoes, pasta bolognese, mushroom risotto and chicken with saut\u00e9ed vegetables. Out of everything I really enjoyed the sliders, mushroom risotto and the filet mignon. \n\nEven though the two events that I attended were free and the food was pre-set, I still looked over the menu and its on the pricier side. Although the price is a little high, it's definitely worth it in my opinion since the quality of food and the view are both spectacular. I'm definitely planning on stopping by MIX on my next visit to Vegas.\n\n**You MUST stop by the restrooms here! Both have amazing views as you are taking care of business. It's not the nicest bathrooms, but the view is definitely worth checking out!"

My husband picked this place out and I could not have been happier with the entire experience.\n\nWe started off with a few cocktails in the lounge area.  Breathtaking view of the strip at night from 64 floors up.  A ride in a glass elevator to the top gives you an out of this world experience.\n\nThe lounge itself is dark, intimate and  fun.  Tables  are adorned with drink menus which are lit up to display the delicious drinks they offer.  We were there to kick off the night, which entails a lounge toast with a complimentary glass of champagne.  Clink glasses with your neighbors and staff - a sure way to start the night off right, all while soaking in Sin Cities night lights.\n\nAfter a few cocktails we moved to the restaurant.  A complete opposite spectrum versus the lounge.  Pristine, white, airy, beautiful and romantic.  Decor is fantastic, I could not help but stare. Service was phenomenal from beginning to end.\n\nI  started off with an order of the shrimp cocktail.  A lovely dish, more like a salad, with jumbo shrimp atop greens mixed with horseradish and a tomato syrup.  Mix it all together and you have a scrumptious combo that will leave any jarred cocktail sauce in the dust.  Simply amazing.  The flavors melded into a creation I could eat over and over again.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Roasted Maine Lobster \"Au Curry\" by our servers recommendation.  Chunks of sweet maine lobster atop coconut basmati rice with a subtle curry sauce.  The sweet lobster and coconut rice really accented the curry sauce beautifully.  The portion was certainly nicer than anticipated and I was left feeling quite full.  \n\nWe had also ordered a bottle of wine and was happy to have a wine expert help pair wine to our meal choices.  5 stars all around!!!"

There were three of us including one vegetarian. We chose Mix because I had never been there before and heard the food and the views were stunning. I also knew it was a Michelin star restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance and dcor are quintessential new Vegas, over the top and elegant, not to mention the view from the 64th floor. I loved the glass fixtures hanging from the ceiling.\n\nThe server was good. He went out of his way to recommend a special dish that wasn't on the menu that he eats as a vegetarian for my friend. He wasn't perfect, though. At the beginning of the service he asked if we preferred still or sparkling water. I always thought still mean tap...apparently I was wrong. They brought out VOSS water and kept refilling our glasses without asking. We ended up being charged 30 dollars for water. Fine.\n\nDinner was great, but nothing I would run back for. I had a specialty pork chop and my wife had venison. Again, both great, but not worth a second trip."

It is a gorgeous restaurant with a beautiful view of the south end of the strip. At night it also doubles as an ultra lounge witha dj that spins house music. \n\nWe went here for my birthday dinner during a Vegas birthday trip last night and was thouroughly satisfied. We started off with various apertifs which were nothing special. We started off with a complimentary bread basket served with whipped butter and fresh peanut butter which was deelish. \n\nI had the 10 oz NY strip with the house sauce and asparagus and mushroom fricasse for sides. I must say, the steak with the sauce was the best I've ever had. So yummy, its making my mouth water just thinking back. The sides we're also very tasty and complimented the steak nicely. \n\nFor dessert, I had the coco lime sorbet with candied almonds on top. It was very refreshing and light. A perfect dessert for such a heavy protein meal. They brought out the dessert with a sparkler and Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate, a very nice touch, I thought. \n\nAfter dessert, they brought us fresh baked madeleines which I found out was thei signature \"end\" to the meal. Yum!\n\nThe MIX is a fantastic fine dining experience with a great atmosphere and first class service. Expect to pay at least $100 per person for a 2 course meal & aperitif, however, it is very much worth it."

My buddy arranged it with the mix lounge front desk that we would get reservation/bottle service and no cover before midnight...sounded perfect since we were all still hurting from going hard the night before. We did some pre-drinking in our rooms and headed down there by 11'ish...only to find out that the elevator is stuck! The cocky guy standing at the front desk asks for our number and said he'll call us if they get it fixed. Calls us 15 minutes later telling us that they won't be opening it up for the rest of the evening.... totally putting a wrench in our plans/wallet since we're gonna have to go some where else to party. Instead of referring us and moving our reservation to rum jungle or one of their affiliates, he basically said sorry and offered his connections to some other clubs some where outside of the hotel...and of course, nothing is free....we said forget it and we went with a different route that night. I know this place is pretty chill, but the way they conducted their business with us, they really should've taken care of us if they knew that we were willing to spend $500+ here!"

            "review": "I'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and I had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Mix.  On one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a Saturday evening in Vegas for a seven hour event.  \n\nSo, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  Edit: looks like I have to trim my review, I hit the 5000 character limit. :-(\n\n1) Ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate Mix.  There is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  The interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.\n\nThe main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  If you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  If you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  I recommend after dark for balcony seating.\n\n2) Service - I've never had a bad experience at Mix.  My wife and I visited Vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at Mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  We did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  Drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.\n\nWe've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  I'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.\n\n3) Special requests.  They've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  For example, on our first anniversary when we went back, I arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to Mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  The restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  If you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.\n\n4) FOOD!  Okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  Here's what we've had and when:\n\na) The pepper crusted bison tenderloin, cod brandade and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  The bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  On the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.\n\nb) Surf & turf.  Although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  My wife gets this religiously and loves it.  I will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from N9NE at the Palms.  There's regular surf & turf, then there's Mix's surf & turf, then there's the N9NE surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.\n\nc) Filet mignon rossini with foie gras & black truffle sauce.  If you're into truffles, I'm sure you'll love this.  The steak comes out perfectly.  I'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  Perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.\n\nd) Roasted maine lobster \"au curry\".  I love spicy, I love Indian food, I love this meal.  It's my go-to Mix meal; I get it every time once I tried it.  It's perfect combo of everything I love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.\n\nDon't forget to go visit the Mix Lounge next door after dinner!  Great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course)."

It is expensive, and your paying for the view, but get there before 10 and take care of one of the hosts and sit outside right at the edge for an hour and relax, you wont be disappointed!!"

I wasn't sure what to expect since the line was very small....and people walking out said it wasn't worth it.  Instead of paying $30 each, we opted to pay for bottle service...costing $360 for entry, table, bottle of vodka, Red Bull, tax, and tip.  I have to agree with other folks that it can be pretty pricey here.\n\nAs soon as we arrived to the 64th floor, I noticed a small and cozy lounge with spectacular views....especially from our table!  The music was alright, dance floor was small, staff was friendly, and there was a lot of breathing room (that night).  Stogies were lit and we enjoyed our night!  Thanks guys!"

First off, this place is, hands down, nicest decor I've ever seen for a restaurant/lounge. Second, the appetizers and desserts here are AMAZING. Third, the view is breathtaking.\n\nDecor: 5\nFood: Appetizers 5, Entrees 3.5, Dessert 5\nService: 3.5\nPrice: It's what you expect to pay. Note** We didn't end up ordering any drinks so I can't tell you how good (or bad) those are\n\nFood: For the appetizers we ordered the tuna tar tar and foie gras (the bigger portion). The Tuna Tartar was delicious but theFoie Gras was AMAZING. The pieces are pretty damn generous and it sits in this slightly sweet sauce (but I like the taste of it by itself). My gosh, this really set my standard for good foie gras. I would come back just to order a bunch of foie gras for myself. For the entrees, we ordered halibut and sea bass. Now, I'm not a big fan of those two fishes to begin with so to me, the entrees were just okay. However, my boyfriend loves halibut and he said that it was cooked very well. Now comes the dessert, we ordered the Mix Candy Bar. YUM YUM YUM!  It's basically a chocolate, peanut butter and graham cracker (with other stuff I don't remember) bar with a lime coconut sorbet on the side. The rich chocolate and light sorbet really really complemented each other well.\n\nService: Our waiter wasn't the most attentive but he was definitely the most honest, which I appreciate. The downside was, he always seemed to be walking away and was always hard to track down. He was also a big fan of upselling EVERYTHING. Sheesh, please stop. However, the upside? He would straight up tell us whether something was good or not. I loved it. \"Is this good?\" \"No not at all\" haha I do appreciate that he didn't try to water down how much he hated something.\n\nI would've given this place a 5 if the entrees weren't so underwhelming (maybe I just ordered the wrong things?) but oh well. I LOVED everything else\n\nOne more thing, when they ask you if you want sparkling or flat water, just say tap. I made the mistake of thinking it was tap and they ended up bringing over VOSS water which cost a whopping $10. $10 for water? COME ON now. I will know better for next time.\n\nObviously people come here for the view, which, from the restaurant is nice. But if you want the really good view, head over to the lounge area and take a look. It's easily the best view I've seen of the strip so far."

The service falls somewhere in between 2 and 3 stars. \n\nI took my mom here for Christmas dinner, and we were both impressed by the view and the decor as you walk in the restaurant. MIX sits on the 65th floor of the THEHotel next to Mandalay Bay, and the restaurant has dazzling 360-degree views of the Las Vegas Strip. In the middle of the main dining area is an artistic installation of a curtain of glass bubbles overflowing from the ceiling. It is quite impressive to watch. \n\nAs for the food, we had fois gras and pumpkin gnocchi for appetizers. Both were tasty and just the right portion size. The fois gras is not as sweet as the ones I've tasted (where they caramelize it with fruit), and it is well seared. The gnocchi was creamy and had good flavor when paired with thin strips of bacon and cheese. My mom and I both ordered lobster dishes and they were both also very good. \n\nMy biggest gripes about this place were related to the service. First, for the amount of money that I am spending for dinner, I expect my glass of water to be filled without me having to ask first. Same with the sodas. Instead, I had to ask the waiter at the end of the meal (when I was coughing out loud) for water. Secondly, my mom had asked for one of the items in their fixed price menu (which cost $28) as an a la carte. The server asked the chef, and he got back to us to say that this was okay. However, when I was finally ready to pay for the bill, they had marked this one item up as 100% MORE than the original price. I'm not worried about the price, but in principle, what they did was sneaky, and I did not like it one bit. Lastly, when we were leaving to walk towards the Mandalay Bay entrance (which is where we came in), they had to shoo us back towards the THEHotel entrance because of a private function (although the lounge itself was totally empty). \n\nSo all in all, while the food tasted great, there are other fancy restaurants out there with better service that I could go to in the future."

I took my girlfriend here for her birthday last year because I found it online at Restaurant.com and looked at the reviews and the restaurant website, and was sold when I saw that #1 it's Alain Ducasse (whose restaurant itinerary is an impressive 24 restaurants at the moment and who has his own culinary school in Paris- a true pioneer of French cooking) and #2 I saw pictures of the restaurant. If you look at my picture you'll know what I'm talking about. The impact of the ceiling to floor hand-made blown glass sphere's that surround an intimate and prestigious table for one in the center of the restaurant really takes your breath away. And actually, we learned from our waiter, that the table placed in the middle of this glass ceiling jewelry is no longer allowed to be used, because it is not handicap accessible (they're stairs).\n\nFor dinner we had ZERO complaints, which pretty much has not happened for me at any restaurant. One of the best dining experience of my life. Here's what my girlfriend and I enjoyed for dinner:\n\nShared appetizer:\nTENDER POTATO GNOCCHI with sunchoke, Parmigiano Reggiano and  veal jus. The BEST gnocchi I've ever tasted. Tender is an understatement.\n\nEntrees:\nROASTED MAINE LOBSTER \"AU CURRY\" with coconut basmati rice. Speechless, just speechless.\n\nCOD BRANDADE with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons & fried parsley. Those croutons were basically a vehicle to supply your taste buds with a burst of butter, and that coupled with the largest capers I've ever seen (they were the size of peas!) and the fried parsley- just incredible.\n\nNow that I've popped my Alain Ducasse cherry, I will definitely be visiting Adour New York and Benoit New York when I have a large chuck of change burning a hole in my pocket. Oh, and if you go, check out the bathroom in Mix Lounge next door. You'll see what I mean when you get there."

The drinks are pricey but it's worth a drink or two when you're out in the balcony looking down from the 64th floor of the Mandalay Bay. Nice and windy up there.\n\nAnd oh yah, plenty of different dj's throughout the night so you get a pretty good mix of music and dance songs to get your groove on on the floor. Seems the atmosphere of dress wear was also mixed but coming here somewhat dressy is also the preferred method of partying. But again, there is mix of both dressy and casual dressing throughout the evening on both my visits here.\n\nEverywhere is pretty dark. Seating is usually reserved or if you got the bottle service, so if you come here early...like 11pm, then maybe you might get some seating. Otherwise it's pretty much standing room only everywhere you go. The urinal is cool but awkward since there is view of the outside from the 64th floor but at the same time, you're looking directly ahead at another set of urinals from across the hotel so there is a good chance you're making eye contact with a dude pissing at the same time.\n\nPretty awesome views, the people aren't trashy or anything, seems more sophisticated, varying music throughout the night and plenty of security everywhere. Yah, this place is cool."

If you are here for the food, you have made a mistake.  There are so many places in LV to go for an amazing gastronomic experience, that Mix doesn't even begin to contemplate playing in that ballpark (though they may be fronting like they do by serving hoity-toity dishes like foie gras with chicken terrine.) However, it's more than just what you're serving, it really comes down to how it tastes.  Our party of four tried several different options and none commanded anything but average reviews, and some were even worse than that.  My ribeye, which our waiter assured was \"excellent,\" was not.  It would have been excellent if I ordered it at Denny's or Sizzler with some eggs, but it wasn't excellent at some ritzy LV restaurant.  I didn't even care to finish it.  And I always care to finish a good cut of meat.  It tasted like a supermarket bought steak, prepared clumsily at home.  That's how good it was.  The foie gras was horrible, neither it's taste, appearance or texture were appetizing.  My husband ordered scallops.  Again, okay if they were from a buffet.  They were out of the cod entr\u00e9e, which is what I remembered enjoying on my previous visit.  Our meal was so un-spectacular that I can barely recall the other appetizers we ordered or the dessert.  Our server was a tad curt and unavailable and not forthcoming with recommendations or suggestions.  In all, we regret having wasted our one night out in LV at Mix. The view is nice, but not nearly enough to redeem the poor quality and taste of dinner.  We were so hungry after the Michael Jackson Cirque show downstairs that we ignored our better judgment that was telling us to eat at SW instead.  Sorry Mix, we won't be coming back."

As if Mandalay Bay wasn't already a classy place, you also have this gem of a bar to boot.\n\nThe first time I came here was with my cousin and my brother for his 21st birthday (I was the older bro sponsoring the trip) and I walk into this elevator only to have our entire party confused.  There were a series of plaques, and the three of us plus the other people in the elevator were all scratching our heads as to what to do.  Then I thought, hmm, I wonder if that plaque is some Indiana-Jones-Business where you push it in to get to the secret room.  YUP.\n\nThe elevator goes up, the doors open, and you're treated to some red mood lighting and the thump thump thump of a tight sounding track.  This is what I want when I come to the place where dreams are made.  We walked in and were treated to a fantastic view of all of Las Vegas, a dancing bachelorette party, leather couches, champagne, disco lighting, etc, etc.  Needless to say, the Mix Lounge is the right choice.  Haven't tried the food or done anything in the Chandelier room, but stritcly speaking for the lounge area they hit the nail on the head.  Bartenders were friendly and provided prompt service, although drink prices were still very vegas-esque, as in the tune of $10-20 a drink.  The second time I came here I ordered 3 jameson shots and it was $34.  Yikes.\n\nThe outdoor area was a great experience.  We sat laid back on comfortable couches sipping our champagne while having a nice social time and taking in the incredible view.  What more could you ask for when you're in Vegas.  And the best part is this place is always advertised as the pre-party, but you can get lost spending hours there.\n\nMy only gripes that knocked off a star are pretty minor.  The second time I went there they had the outside closed due to \"inclement weather\" because it was windy and 30 degrees.  I'm from Wisconsin, OPEN DEM DOORS UP.  Unless I see precipitation, this is not inclement weather.  And as mentioned, the drink prices could be a little better.  Aside from that, completely worth it"

In the dining room there is a small second floor area, however  it is not available for any guests to use.\n\nDon't forget to use the bathrooms!!! For the guys there is a window over the urinals with a view of the pools. And for the women, in the stalls the toilet is facing out because there are  windows out towards the Mandalay Bay. Check it out!\n\nUsually around 10 pm people can buy a bottle/table outside, so if you are seated at a table outside in the lounge, they may ask you to move to another un-used table.\n\nHappy Hour is i beleive Monday thru Friday 5-7pm, 25% off in the lounge off drinks and appetizers."

The food selection on the menu is decent, with most of the standard fair you'd expecet (a handful each of appetizers, fish & seafood, meats &  poultry).  Expect to pay a hefty price for your view, with prices ranging from 45 to 60+ dollars for entrees (and thats for non \"market price\" items), which is a little silly, even for French (or French/American) cuisine in Vegas.  Tack on appetizers, a beverage, and dessert (at your discretion) and expect $150 a head.\n\nThe food preparation was respectable, but, by no means were my companions and I impressed.   The foie was decent, as was the bisque.  The huckleberry sauce for the fois was well balanced with just enough tartness and sweetness, but, one of my liver pieces was a bit veiny.  Kudos for having caviar on the menu.  The fish was nicely prepared (not overdone) but relatively straight forward (no pow).  The scallop caesar was good, but the romaine wedge seemed tough, and the addition of basalmic over the dish made everything a little too tangy.  Bacon makes anything taste better, and this was no exception as there were plenty of rendered bacon bits.  Oddly enough, none of us had any meat dishes, which I would've like to have been able to comment on.  The desserts looked fabulous, but only tasted okay good and didn't quite close the deal for me.  But, overall a decent meal.  Unfortunately, I was left with the feeling that the food experience paled in comparison to the personal experience as the presentation and service outshined the flavors.\n\nThe most memorable things were 1) the cool environment, 2) the sheer number of handblown glass bulbs hanging from the central chandelier and of course 3) the view.  \n\nReally, this place is all about ambiance.  And thats ok, as long as it doesn't try to pretend to be something else.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat, if only to enjoy the view from the top.  But next time, i may decide to grab a bite elsewhere before heading up there to relax.  Maybe at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar downstairs?"

The server made sure our champagne was full as well. View was epic. Drinks came quickly. Tje place is pretty cool looking also.\n\nCons\nWe waited at the host desk for 2 to 3 minutes while people looked at us but no one helped us. The restaurant was completely empty. We finally got a table outside and it was wonderful. The second downside was that our server was less than communicative. He didn't seem like he wanted to be there and acted very monotone. The literal service was good the personality with a bit of a downer.\n\nWe will try elsewhere next time. There are a ton of restaurants in LV."

However, for the c-note per person average expense: the food and service left much to be desired.\n\nI am quick to judge an upscale restaurant on a simple rule: do they offer you a dark or light napkin depending upon your attire?  I was wearing a black dress.  Everything is white at MIX.  No offer of a black napkin.  Okay- that is my little hang up, but usually it is not a deal breaker.\n\nWe were seated in a lovely corner seat, but before we had ordered our wine, the hostess seated another party directly next to us (the tables were tight in and had to be moved to seat anyone in or out - so when I say 'next to', I mean literally 'on top of').  If it were a busy night, that would have been fine, but there were only a handful of tables occupied.  In fact, we were so close that when the palate cleanser came out - the waitress made a joke and served both our table and our unexpected dinner partners' together as if we were in the same party.\n\nThe servers were nice- but my plate was taken before I was done with my meal and water spots on our flatware were pointed out to us (seriously) and explained why they weren't dirty, it was just a chemical-reaction-but-here-is-a-new-spoon-anyway-even-though-you-didn't-ask.  Who knew there was flatware TMI?\n\nThe food was decent.  Our highlight was a phenomenal bottle of wine (very extensive wine list) and the ravioli appetizer - out of this world.  Our entrees?  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWe went to MIX for a romantic Vegas evening.  It was definitely Vegas- but Vegas in the 'pot-bellied-balding-Elvis-impersonator' sort of way.  I wouldn't complain if it were my only Elvis sighting- but you know it doesn't live up to what is around every other corner.\n\nBut- the view was spectacular."

You take a very scenic elevator ride up to the restaurant. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a dark, sexy lounge at the entrance. We walked by a very large and CLEAN kitchen (where the magic happens). The dining room is large and modern. But we were sat in the patio. OMG the view is UNREAL! You can see the end side of Luxor and the entire lit up Vegas Strip! The most romantic table in las vegas and we were sitting at it!\nThe rest of the experience matched the beauty of the view. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable giving us great recommendations and really making us feel special. We had the borabora (a cocktail that takes your tastebuds on vacation!) and did the tasting menu with wine pairings. All the food and wine paired wonderfully. The vegetable salad was delicious and light. The gnocchi was so light and fluffy, perfect little potato pillows. I had the bison and my boyfriend got the filet. Both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection and tasted so good with all the components on the plate. We were brought out a pre dessert in a martini glass. A little sip of coconut heaven!!! The housemade sorbets are a must! I got the exotic sorbet and it was the perfect finish to an amazing meal! \nThank you so much to Mix for making our 10 year anniversary so very special and unforgettable!"

We got comp passes from theStore (huge overuse of the word \"the\", btw) and went here the day after NYE (which was probably why it wasn't that crowded). The elevator ride and the view - these two factors alone count for a star, each! This had to be one of the best views of the Strip I've ever seen (even better than ghostbar). \n\nThere is a really small dancefloor, but you shouldn't come here to dance. It's a great lounge if you're looking for a relaxed night with a good group of friends. There are a ton of couches to sit down on and take in the fabulous view. The music was just ok - nothing special. This place was super fun!"

It's a nice change of pace from earlier parts of the weekend when we were clubbing around Vegas.  There's a bullet elevator going up to the top; awesome view.

Our waitress seemed too busy to give us attention, although we did see her chatting with other staff members.  When we tried to order a sampler dish, she told us that my wife and I BOTH had to order the dish or else we couldn't have it.  Later on, our friends told us that they were able to order the sampler dish without a problem.\n\nI ordered the sea bass and my wife ordered the halibut.  For 38 and 48 dollars respectively, both fish were slightly overcooked although the flavors were okay.  We are not big eaters, but the filets were so small, there weren't many vegetables (we had to order an additional side of asparagus) and even after dessert and almost 200 dollars later, we were still hungry after our meh dishes.\n\nWhen we were done, our waitress walked by and dropped the check on our table before we asked for it.  Only after she inspected the generous tip that we still left her did she look up at us and say thank you.  \n\nThe quality of the dishes were on par with the buffet at Bellagio.  We would be more than happy to pay for food that's made with attention and flavor, and served with politeness.  However, after this experience, we will not go to Mix again."

My husband booked in advance, specifically requesting balcony seating so we could enjoy the view. We arrived early for our reservation and were seating in a corner inside, and were told, \"sorry, only tables for larger parties were still available.\" We were bummed, but the interior decor is pretty cool to look at, with all the bubbles hanging from the middle of the room. I guess they were slammed because it took awhile for the server to get to us. He was a little standoffish at first but when my husband asked his name, he warmed up immediately. Once we ordered and told him we were starving, the food came out quickly. Four kinds of bread, including sourdough, french and dinner rolls. The bread was average but they include this homemade peanut butter that was to die for. My husband's first $16 martini was totally watered down. When he complained, they shouldn't have charged for it, and offered a second one to make up for it. My husband ordered the cod, which was unbelievable. Flaky and crispy skin on top and moist, buttery goodness underneath. Wow! Unfortunately, the other items we ordered were average. I got the scallops, which were fine. Nothing spectacular. A little on the small side. But their \"famous\" mac n cheese? I can't understand why it's famous? Very mediocre."

They accent it with bits of red to add a contrast. That is probably where my favorites of this place end. \n\nI had the spicy crab salad, it had chunks of crab and avocado and veggies. It was just ok. Other people in the party ordered the fish, the free range chicken which was very moist, and the filet. Everything was just kind of bland and nothing special. My favorite thing was the walnut and raisin bread which I asked for seconds. The bread comes with regular butter and a peanut butter flavored butter. That was very interesting.  I liked how at the end they give you a complimentary madeline with a hazelnut (basically nutella) dip. I would of given it a 1 star if it wasn't for the amazing decor, probably one of my favorites in vegas, Too bad the food isn't up to par and the menu has a very limited selection."

However, the reason we picked this place for a romantic dinner was because we had read that the 46th floor view was stunning.  \n\n1) the view in the restaurant is NOT nice.  If you want a nice strip view, get appetizers and drinks in the lounge, but do not commit to a full dinner...you won't have a view\n\n2) the seating along the window faces away from the window.  Not one person sitting at the window can see out of it without looking away from their dinner date\n\n3) everything except for the red water glasses and pink tealight holders is white...EVERYTHING.  The well intended decor would be interesting, but instead it feels slightly like a mental institution with abstract curves and balls of glass hanging from the ceiling while offering nothing stimulating to look at.\n\nStick to the lounge.

Most Amazing view atop the Delano Hotel behind the Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe restaurant is all white decor with touches of red with a humongous white bobbled centerpiece chandelier that you cannot miss.  There are large tables for groups and cute mini-egg shaped booths for two.  We did the pre-fix menu which included wine pairings and were somewhat disappointed. Each entry basically consisted of tiny miniature food on large white plates.  I don't care for food that needs to be explained and that's basically what this was.  Every time a new course was served we were all trying to figure out what it was.  There were a few items that seemed as an attempt to woo you into thinking they were trying to hard such as a pina-colada flavored warm cocktail served in a martini glass.  Not the most refreshing.  And a madeline cookie for desert.  Not what you would expect from a high-class restaurant.\n\nThe women's restroom did offer a view although not easy to appreciate through the glare of the restroom lights.

Overall, our experience was disappointing:\nThe Good:\n-the restaurant is beautiful and the view is unparalleled\n-the food was good, but not great\nThe Bad:\n-the food servings (the filet in particular) were too small for the price\n-the wine pairings were underwhelming.  There were at least two wines that all of us disliked\n-the service was poor.  The waiting staff was slow to begin with and quickly petered out.  By the end, our table felt ignored for a good half hour.\n-the restrooms are pathetic--just sad.\nThe Ugly:\n-our waiter tried to overcharge us $270.  When we first got our bill, we noticed that it had three extra dinners on it, along with a 20% tip.  When we were finally able to find our waiter to call him over, he immediately grabbed the bill and said he knew what was wrong and would fix it--without given us even a chance to explain the problem.  He clearly knew the issue beforehand (but hadn't made any effort to come get the bill from us first).  I can assure you that although we tried to find some innocent explanation for his conduct, everyone in our group left with the impression that the waiter had intentionally tried to slip the extra charges by us (since the bill was so large anyway and we had had several glasses of wine by that point).\nFor the price you pay to eat here, diners should expect and receive top notch service and food. MIX fails to deliver. The issues with the food and service (even without the \"extra dinner charges\" issue) were even more glaring after we had a wonderful dinner at Picasso the next night.  The experience was simply night and day."

The decor makes you feel like you're walking on air and the views of the strip are amazing. We are the family that doesn't let the fact that we have a child hold us back from dining where we want to on vacation. She's well-behaved and she's 9 but nevertheless, some places frown upon children and we never got that impression at all. The staff treated her exactly how we want her to be treated in a restaurant, in such a way that helps give her a chance to use her manners - they asked her for her order, not me or my husband, and treated her like any other diner. We were a bit nervous when an elderly couple sat next to us as we didn't know how they'd feel about being seated next to a family, but later on in the meal the woman told us she was completely full and asked if we minded if she offered for our daughter to try her souffle. \n\nTo start, our family was served the Thai Coconut Chicken soup which was very good. I started with the shrimp cocktail which was absolutely delicious. I could have been done right there. Finished it off with the Maine Lobster Curry which I loved. My husband had the tasting menu and was in heaven. My daughter had the Macaroni & Cheese with ham side and that was perfect for her.

            "review": "Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.\n\nWith the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. \n\nAfter glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.\n\nBreads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting \"peanut\" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. \n\nAmuse\n\nFoie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam \n\n- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish\n\nGnocci\nWith Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.\n\nNot the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. \n\nMain lobster curry with coconut basmati rice \n\n- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.\n\nFilet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce \n\n- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. \n\nPredessert\n\nCoconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.\n\nBaba a la marnagnac\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.\nThe liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.\n\nOverall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. \nWith that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  \n3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.\n\nUntil then...\n\nHappy Eats!"

You know, the breathtaking Las Vegas Strip view, ceiling to floor windows, very tasteful food, and excellent service.\n \nOur group was fortunate to have Jonathan as our server. He was very attentive and not a single thing was wrong ! By far the best server I have ever had. \n\nSurf and Turf was very succulent which came with Lobster Tail and Stake. I highly recommend this platter and all of the sides are good but it's obviously up to your flavor of taste. \n\nThe view is great and there is also a lounge/outdoor lounge/club overlooking the strip as soon as you exit the restaurant !"

Cocktails are set at Strip prices (i.e. not cheap), but the drinks are quality pours and the atmosphere is spectacular. I always try to hit it when it opens (5pm) so we can snag an outside table. It is a great way to start out the evening, especially if you are doing dinner afterward, as you can grab a drink before dinner, admire the view and then be on your merry way. Oh yeah, and make sure you hit up the restrooms, always a great experience for out-of-towners. If you are doing an after-dinner drink, order the cheesecake, it is one of the best in the Valley."

But this is a town full of nice restaurants.\n\nThe space is amazing - you take a glass elevator up to the top of THEhotel, and step into a cross between a nightclub and an 1960's movie version of heaven's lobby with a huge chandelier taking up most of the room.  There are spectacular views of the strip ( ask for a table with a view ), as well as an outdoor balcony area ... 65 floors up.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the tasting menu is a little bit ... difficult to obtain.  We were one of the later reservations of the evening, and were rather put out to discover that the chef was uninterested in providing us with his best at that hour.  They did not indicate that full service would be unavailable when we made our reservation.\n\nAfter that rather rough start, service was very friendly and personal.\n\nThe food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Roasted Curry Lobster is definitely the stand out - a more adventurous combination of flavors.  Otherwise, they have a foie dish, tuna tartare, steak and seafood that are not particularly different, or memorable.  Even the chef's tasting is just a combination of regular menu items.\n\nSo - go for the setting and the view, but don't expect to always be able to get the tasting, and look forward to a competent but rather uninspired dinner."

Boy were we disappointed.  The service was awful. Waiters and waitresses were running around the restaurant all night.   We had to to move tables after they sat us near the waitress station. Which ultimately didn't matter, as the restaurant was so loud and rowdy.  \n\nThe food was like bad wedding food.  We had the gnocci and tuna tartar appetizer. Eh.  The cod was awful as was the wagyu.  We complained to both the manager and general manager.  They offered us free dessert, but after such a horrendous meal, we passed.  \n\nFor such a \"fancy\" restaurant, the dress attire was not existent.  People were in flip flops and shorts. Definitely not a quality restaurant, and not worth the money.\n\nSave your money and time.  There was nothing enjoyable about our dinner.  We would have had better luck gambling the money than wasting it on this meal.  There are better restaurants to try on the strip.\n\nIts an embarrassment that Alain Ducasse has his name on this restaurant."

Forget the Stratosphere, forget all the other towering hotels, the view is breathtaking. \n\n1/27/11, My sister was turning 21 and ready to go to a club. I hadn't been to Mix, so we, along with two friends, decided to go there. Fast forward to 11 PM. After waiting absolutely no time, we got into the elevator, after I almost face planted my way in. Watch your step, the elevator is not flush with the floor, so be cautioned so you don't end up stubbing your toe then propelling into the elevator. \n\nUp, up, up we went. A bunch of guys from Kitchener, probably in their mid to late 30's were chatting. I said, \"So you guys from Ontario?\" They said yes and asked if I was as well, especially since I knew about Kitchener. Nope. I just know famous cities.\n\nAfter getting out of the elevator... crickets... and old people. I'm talking a table of 80-somethings on the balcony. WHAT WAS THIS? A small round dance floor in the corner with not a single soul gracing it. A long row of tables. A KITCHEN? What else? Oh yeah, Warren G. was blasting.  We stayed maybe 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe music was great, the view was great, but the crowd was a bust. I had no idea this place was a restaurant. It's very misleading that they advertise this as a dance club - it's not. The music was so good that it got 2 stars and an extra star for the view. \n\nWill I be back - probably not, especially if I'm looking to dance or see somebody under the age of 40."

First, the views are amazing. We got here about 20 minutes before our reservation and were greeted downstairs by a very rude hostess (hence the 4 stars) who said \"Just go up the elevator, OK\"... so up we went, which the elevators are so cool - you can see the entire strip out the window - and then were greeted into the lounge. The lounge area is outside and they have lots of heaters and AMAZING views of the strip - we sat and had a drink for about 15 min - and it was so nice. they also serve appetizers out there if you just want a drink + app. Then we went into the restaurant and had window seating - which was again so  beautiful. The entire strip is lit up  behind you and the restaurant atmosphere is so pretty. Our waiter was super attentive and sweet. The food was delicious! We had the chicken and the filet plus two sides of the fries (so yummy) and the potatoes (equally as yummy). For dessert we had the chocolate souffle which is take it or leave it (not as yummy). I give 4 stars based on the dessert, our waiter forgetting my coffee, and the rude hostess downstairs. I definitely recommend coming here though for the amazing views and food and hopefully the downstairs hostess gets better with time. Must come!!!"

You'll hate it.\n\nI can't help but rate 1 with the terrible service we received at the restaurant last weekend.\n\nWe went to Vegas for Uncork'd but because my 30th Birthday had just passed we wanted to do an intimate dinner with close friends. Part of why we chose to stay at THEhotel at Mandalay was because we knew we wanted to have dinner at Mix. The views were gorgeous and the interior was just right up my alley.\n\nWhen we made reservations for the hotel, we also made reservations for Mix so it was well in advance. Close to 3 weeks. At that time we were not asked if we wanted to sit outside. We didn't even know there was outdoor seating for dinner. I thought that was only part of the lounge area.\n\nFirst mistake was sitting us outside without asking if it was ok till later in the evening. It was a little hot for 8pm, but we figure with the views and the soon to be ordered drinks, it would be fine. We didn't think we'd be there for 2.5 hours anyway.\n\n30 minutes pass and all we have so far is water and a menu. The waiter, I believe his name was Lukas, finally comes with the drink and wine menu along with the specials. He was actually pretty knowledgeable about the food so that was probably the first (and only) good sign.\n\nHe comes back to take our order 15 minutes later - still with only water. We ask for bread. Awesome. We have to ask for our own bread when it's obvious the tables around us have bread (and drinks). At this point, no one even wants to drink because the moment has passed. We're 45 minutes into the dinner with water and a menu. WTF? It's not even busy.\n\nSo we order. \n\nAnd then we wait and wait and wait. And laugh about waiting because it's just so ridiculous.\n\nOver an hour into our 8pm reservations we have a glass of water with no ice in warm summers night, a couple cocktails because the service somehow managed to take away our fun spirits (and we're a rowdy but classy bunch) and some bread.\n\nOh but you know who had fun? The waiter sure did. This Mother F'n waiter sure was chatting it up with some ladies behind us. We saw the water guy more than him.\n\nClose to 2 hours we manage to swoop up a bus boy to ask about our food. He says he'll check with our waiter and a few minutes later our food comes out. Did we just have to remind the bus boy, to remind the waiter, that he has a table to serve? Don't you watch Top Chef? Don't you know the chef's are bustin' their chops to get the food fired up?!\n\nOur food was luke warm - not hot - which leaves me to believe some dishes were sitting out while this jerk flirted with the ladies. Who by the way, were not all that. I ain't mad at the cougars though.\n\nBy the end of the meal - we don't even want whatever the heck it is they do for birthdays - we just ask for the check. He then said \"are you sure you don't wanna see the dessert menu?\" We all kinda said no no no at the same time wanting to get the f*ck outta there and then he said \"I'll bring you out something anyway on the house for the trouble\" - he then brings out this crap that we saw him serving to everyone around us. So no, you're not sorry at all.\n\nYou just want your $100+ mandatory gratuity for a party of 8 that you didn't actually wait on and instead dodged our table for over 2 hours while the bus boy served us water.\n\nWe talk to the manager afterwards looking for a sincere apology and instead he decides to blame us for not seeking him during dinner. WTF? Why don't you get off your lazy a-hole and ask if your tables are doing ok if your waiters aren't doing the job.\n\nSeriously, this was the worst birthday experience myself and friends have ever had to endure. \n\nAnd the worse part was that this guy got $100+ tip. I would have rather gave that to the guy serving us water all night long.\n\nOh and the food? Fish was overcooked which sucks because it was the Sea bass which apparently has been on the menu since day one... but because it was probably sitting out for 30 minutes probably over cooked. The filet's were good. Nothing amazing. \n\nSad sad sad. We were defeated that night and had to head back to the room and rally up some cocktails.\n\nThe only GOOD thing about this night was that it was our first night in Vegas and made us make sure the rest of the trip was a-hole free. Well done MIX!"

It's pretty small, which keeps the scene intimate and keeps a nice aesthetic.  The lounge is lined with booths and there is a decent size dance floor.  \n\nThe view is what really takes the cake though.  If you missed it on the elevator coming up you'll have ample time to enjoy it on the patio on the 64th story.  My recommendation?  GO TO THE BATHROOM.  Have you ever wished to piss whilst staring out into thousands of hotel rooms?  There's something deliciously voyeuristic about it."

The timing can't be more perfect if you can catch the 4pm Lion King and start dinner at MIX by about 7pm.  The view of this restaurant is absolutely breath-taking. It'd be nice if the weather is warmer so you can dine outside. We sat by the window and had a fantastic view. The staff and our server were all nice.  They, for some reason, all spoke with a weird accent. It is difficult to understand at times as if I am in a different country. Oh well, we ordered a pumpkin soup, scallops, cod, mac&cheese side, and chocolate souffle. I liked everything but the scallops. It is a little too salty and the scallops are rubbery (it's kinda my fault to have them cook the scallops well), but they still shouldn't be so salty.  The Cod was cooked really well and well-seasoned. Mac & cheese is rich and creamy! Overall, we like the food and the service. Just the view itself well worth the money."

From the moment you walk in the hotel, you know you are in a hip, updated Las Vegas.  (The lobby smelled like coconuts!)\n\nWe were exactly on time and our party of 4 was immediately seated.  It took a while for me to take in the grandiose and beautifully lit dining room.  They had a couple of \"booths\" that looked like Disneyland's Haunted Mansion doom buggys.  Very cool.  But even cooler was the glass chandelier/sculpture that decorated the entire dining room.  It felt like you were sitting inside a bubbly glass of champagne.  I'll be sure to upload one of those photos. \n\nWe decided to live like high rollers and go for the Grand Tasting Menu with the wine pairing.  http://mandalaybay.com/images/dining/mix_prix_fixe.pdf   \nYes, I know it's expensive, but it was one of the most memorable dining experiences ever.  Each course was an event onto its own.  I'm having trouble choosing my favorite.  Each course would have made a gorgeous meal by itself as a larger portion.  Oh, now I'm realizing I should not write this review on an empty stomach, my stomach is actually growling thinking about this meal.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was the Wine Director/Sommelier Christophe Tassan.  He was extremely attentive and chose amazing wines to complement each course.  He didn't know that my husband and I owned a wine shop until the end of the meal, and was pleasantly surprised to know how much we enjoyed the pairing.  He gave us a menu to take home with a detailed listing of the courses and the paired wines.  A very nice souvenir of our special evening.  \n\nThank you, Chef Alain Ducasse.\nThank you, Sommelier Tassan.\nThank you, the entire attentive Mix staff. \nAnd thank you Las Vegas for memories of a meal that will last my lifetime."

You can't beat the views and the interior of the dining room.\n\nAs far as dining experience, the food is quite incredible.  I would definitely go with at least one fish dish.  From the classics, I had the chef's striped bass.  Even if it came without the squid/octopus and it's base, I would have still loved it.  Same goes for the halibut.  I find it amazing how the chefs can cook such a big piece of fish so evenly and so moist.  \n\nTop the above dishes with the dungeness crab salad and some gnocchi, you will be quite satisfied and full.  Enjoy!\n\nWhy 4 stars?  The service is a bit casual.  The servers are pleasant, but the service doesn't equate to what the customer is paying.  Items are missing, the staff is not completely attentive.  I have a feeling the chef is going for this feel to make it seem unpretentious, but I'm not sure if it's the best model."

I can understand the menu prices based on the ridiculously expensive finishes (I have never encountered leather of the quality that was on the bench in a restaurant before), and the location of the restaurant itself, but, like everything else on the strip, I'd still say it's overpriced.\n\nThe service was also very good. I casually asked the waitress if the salt inside the croissant that came in the basket of five or so different breads was Hawaiian, judging by its pink hue. She said it was fleur de sel, but then came back after double checking with the kitchen to tell me that she was embarrassed that she had told me differently. I don't know where they got all these French speaking bussers. Does Ducasse fly them in? I don't think I encountered one non-French one all night...\n\nThe wine list was very nice, but I easily confused the sommelier and he decided it would be better just to let me try the two I was asking about. He also didn't want to question my thoughts on the pairing with my meal, but I'm not sure he realized I was asking for his expertise.\n\nDespite the fact that I don't think I've seen one venison dish in this town that WASN'T prepared with berries in one way or another, my main dish was quite good. Excellent preparation, beautiful presentation, and you really can't beat a roasted black fig. Paired perfectly with the zin I ended up selecting.\n\nUnfortunately, the view and the decor only does so much. This would have been a great meal at maybe half the price. If it's between here, Aureole, and Fleur De Lys, however, I would wholeheartedly recommend Mix."

I'm always able to find a seat when I'm here and the last time we visited (earlier this month) there was no one around at all.\n\nI love Mix.  You get to ride in a glass elevator to the (near) top of The Hotel and enjoy an awesome view of Vegas.  Once inside, it's just a chill lounge with lots of seating and a large bar.  They have huge windows to view The Strip, or better yet, you can go outside on their little patio and really soak in the sights.\n\nThere's a dj playing some house music at a reasonable level (as in, I can carry on a conversation with my friends) and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  It's the perfect place to bring friends, have a date, or even take family.\n\nI especially love the bathrooms- a room with black floors and walls, a black toilet, a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking Mandalay and the pool, and no outside lights other than the ones making up the Mandalay signs.  It definitely threw me for a loop the first time I came to Mix.\n\nI'm not sure why this place is so slow.... I don't know if they aren't advertising enough and no one knows about it, or if it's because it's a little tricky to find, or because the fact that it's not a club so all the 20-somethings want to party elsewhere....  I really don't get it.\n\nI ALWAYS take friends and family who are in town to Mix, and they are always impressed.  \n\nLocated in The Hotel near the Mandalay Theater entrance.  There was no cover charge when I last went.  Drinks are very overpriced, but that is pretty standard on The Strip."

We got there right at 6 and the place was nearly empty. I believe it had just opened. We were seated immediately. Apparently you can actually eat outside in the restaurant area but it too hot that day according to a sign on the door. I guess they don't want 105 degree air entering the restaurant every 30 seconds. People were walking out there though, just not eating out there. Later in the night when it's busier they probably wouldn't allow that. I haven't been in the girls bathroom but heard the view is the best of any bathroom hands down. The food was good. Pricey but good. Service was prompt. Everyone was friendly. Not a single bad thing to say. A must visit, especially if you're staying in Mandalay Bay/ Delano."

I approached the bar after my first drink and asked if they had any port. I love port and usually have some during the evening. They poured me a glass of Fonseca 20 Year tawny port. The bartender had no idea how to serve it and, charging me 15 bucks for it, proceeded to pour it in a wine glass. The port had a good start but I distinctly tasted a horrible aftertaste of fungus. I've checked around the bottle that was served was well beyond it's \"sell-by date\" so-to-speak. The bottle should have been thrown out ages ago.\n\nLast call: We visited mix on a Sunday evening and the place was a little dead. We were having a good time, enjoying the view and relaxing when the bartender told us it was last call. I looked at my watch: 11 PM. I couldn't believe it. What bar closes at 10 PM? In VEGAS no less. Just because you aren't making money hand over fist doesn't mean you toss what customers you do have out onto the street when they are having a good time and ordering drinks.

The halibut was dry and overcooked. The beef tenderloin was cooked nicely, but lacked anything of significance. Mac and cheese remains a highlight, but you can't really build a reputation around $15 mac and cheese, can you? The prices are still outlandish, which wouldn't be a big deal if the food could rise to the occasion. But it no longer can, and the bubble decor feels a little tired the second time around. Still, the waiters are extremely knowledgable and honest about what's good and what's not, which I really appreciate, but that won't be enough to bring us back."

We had reservations for a weekday, so it wasn't crowded (though we still couldn't get a window seat). It did take them some time however to seat us at a table despite the early reservation time and lack of patrons. The restaurant was crowded later that evening, which was a bit annoying because the tables were placed so close to each other. I could not have a private conversation without the next table overhearing. Also, they dim the lights too much, so I couldn't really see what I was eating. Our female server was very helpful with describing the menu to us, and was more than willing to answer our questions and offer suggestions. However, the other wait staff members didn't seem to care, and were not very friendly. Aside from that, the food was PERFECT. I recommend the surf and turf, it was divine! A delicious seared fish topped with foie gras. Both our entrees were delicious, but they also came with a big price tag even without the wine. In all honesty though, I felt the food was worth the price. This is definately a trendy spot, but it doesn't live up to the hype. However, if you have the money then it is definately a spot to check out for yourself."

The food is pricey, but super fancy and well-thought-out.  I ordered the veggie terrine, which name alone, doesn't really sound great, but in actuality was totally fan-f*cking-tastic!

We have even gone to Mix with residents of Vegas and they were shocked at the magnificent night time views. Service is good and the drinks are fun. It's not cheap but it shouldn't be with that view. Also-check out the bathrooms, they are a trip ( I have only heard about the ladies room). You HAVE to go for the evening view at least once.\n\nThe only reason I did not assign 5 stars is the following: It was a chilly night and Mix does have kerosene heaters near the tables. When we asked the manager to light ours up, he said he could not because there was not enough fuel to keep it lit though the entire night and he needed it  later for the \"club crowd.\" That is a bad answer-At $16-$20 a drink you can buy more fuel. He did come through with some blankets for the women in our group though."

There are a few different sections to MIX so I'll break it down.\n\nThe restaurant:\nThey use to have a Restaurant.com deal so it helped with the steep pricing. The food is pretty good but not memorable.\n\nThe lounge/club:\nThis is not your traditional night club. There is a dinning section, the bar, the outdoors lounge (with a bottle service option of course). There is a DJ but the music is...mixed. I'm not quite sure what genre or timeframe it's from. Not many people dance and the patrons are generally a bit older than the trendy night clubs in town. The bar is a mess. They make some of the drinks \"in the back\"...I put it in quotes because I don't know why the have to go to the back. I see the alcohol, I see the juices...mmm whatever. Like most nightclubs in Las Vegas, the bartenders are swamped and pressured to turn out drinks quickly. I feel for them on that front. But you don't have to have rude to me when I've patiently waited to be served unlike some other people that push and shove and throw money on the bar. Don't huff and puff at me and stomp around. For this reason, I'm not coming back.\n\nOverall:\n+Great view of the strip from here. You can't see as much from the dining room but the lounge is great. Also check out the lounge's restroom! You're in for a surprise!\n-There's obviously no cover to get into the lounge from the restaurant but there generally is a cover after 9 or 10pm. There are often people in the lobby passing out discount entry passes but if you stop by the Mlife desk, they might give you complimentary passes. It's not worth it if you're paying to go up to see the view.\n+/-No dress code (nothing enforced, but lots preferred)"

It's not as packed as other places, but still busy.  I love the ice thing that you put your bottle in.  It wasn't overly loud and the dance floor is very small, but it has the view.

I would not recommend Mix for New Years Eve.  Any other night I would say it is a great choice.\n\nFirst the good.  The 5 course tasting meal was phenomenal.  We didn't just like all the courses, we loved them, and all were simply fantastic.  The opening veggie martin with truffle topping was one of the best appetizers I have tasted.  The wine pairing will also very nice, and our waiter was fantastic during the whole meal service.  It was also a very fun and festive atmosphere.\n\nNow for the bad.  The whole reason we chose Mix, and paid the higher price, was to see the fireworks from their vantage point.  The problem was, we had no view at all.  The only people that had a view were the few tables that opted for outside seating.  The restaurants does NOT overlook the strip, and thus if you pressed your face to the window on one side, you could barely see two of the hotel fireworks.  The view is from the Mix Lounge, however that was closed, and restaurant patrons could not enter.  The other disappointing fact, was our waiter, who was so friendly and attentive, and throughout the whole meal, assured us just before the fireworks he would show us the good spot to stand.  The only problem was, after 11:30, he disappeared, and never reappeared.  There was no good spot, and this seemed in retrospect to have been just a con to get an increased tip.\n\nMix is a fabulous restaurant, and I would highly recommend it, but avoid it in New Year's Eve.  It is a waste of time."

We got the view of the Rio and Palms. I thought our meals were going to be decent with the help of the view, it would be amazing. Apparently, the view didn't even count towards this review because our meals were AMAZING (yes with capital letters).\n\nI like how they brought us the bread basket and instead of just butter, they brought us Peanut Butter & regular butter. Bread was delicious and the peanut butter was really good. It tasted fresh and not too sweet. We told our server, we were going to use our restaurant.com certificate. Our server was kick ass. He was very gracious and very upbeat. The fact that we had a certificate with us didn't change the quality of his service. \n\nI had the Halibut with Bok Choy, Jesse had the Duck dish. Again, for this dinner we shared a bowl of Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I was in the mashed potatoes kick during our trip. My Halibut dish was beautiful. The taste was clean, fresh, and the sauce was perfect. Jesse loved his dish too. However, the star of our meals was the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I ate most of it and felt bad (guilty feeling) afterwards.\n\nService was excellent. Our server was very chatty, but not in the annoying way. He asked our opinions about our meals. At the end, he gave us complimentary Madeleine cookies with Chocolate dipping sauce. I thought that was really sweet of him. \n\nI will highly recommend MIX for all of you. With our without discount certificate, this place is worth a try. At least once."

We did not want dessert but the server brought us some complementary fresh baked madeleines with chocolate.

There are tables available for purchase (and there is a huge price per bottle per Vegas norm).\n\nThere is a fully stocked bars and very friendly bartenders. So friendly that if you get there early enough, the bartenders will treat you like royalty (drinks knocked off your bill and when the place gets busy, they come straight to you).\n\nWhat is also awesome about this place is the bathrooms. I am not sure if this is true for the men's room as well, but the ladies have strip views. You can see out them, but not in them (think like police questioning rooms - as seen on TV). Taking a tinkle here is worth it.\n\nThe only thing that stinks about this place are the douchey security guards. You're a fucking rent a cop, calm down. They weren't rude to me, but they were rude to my friends because our group would sit too close to another groups table (the other tables didn't mind). I got ejected for calling him a rent-a-cop, whatever; jerk can't handle the truth. \n\nMix Lounge is a wonderful, fun place to hang out with friends. Awesome views of the strip, a small, intimate place with a decent sized dance floor and beautiful people. I also like that the crowd her is a little older.

It melted in your mouth. there was a champagne that I had (I can't rememeber what it was called, it was three years ago), one of the best champagnes I've ever had.\n\nIf you're ever looking for an amazing meal with great service and value for what you spend, I definitely reccommend Mix!"

The decor is great and plus the big panoramic views just rounds off the great atmosphere they have going here. They have an open kitchen which you can see all of the stress that goes on trying to keep everything going well in a nice restaurant like this. \n\nWe started with the Charcuterie Sampler that had these nice Italian hams and sausages cut thin. This dish paired well with my New Castle beer!\n\nThen I had the Cod Brandade that was cooked perfectly; the fried parsley added great texture. One of the best Cod dishes I have ever tasted. My girlfriend had the Seared Tuna that was perfectly seared, that dish was very good too. And through out our party I had the chance to taste a few other items that were all very good. Like the Braised Wagyu that just melted in your mouth, Mac and Cheese w/Ham was creamy and salty (in a good way) from the ham, Wild Mushrooms had a nice gravy, and  the John Dory (fish) had huge flavors in a light dish. \n\nAnd in the end we had a great chocolate Souffle; one if the top 5 I've ever tasted!!\n\nMy bill was around $240.00 that included one starter, three main courses, two sides and one chocolate Souffle in the end. I had three beers and the two girls had only water. It was all worth it. \n\nI gave it four star because our waiter had this dry humor that just doesn't come across well when you are pay top dollar for a great dinning experience. \n\nBut I'll be back..."

The room. \nThose are the things that all these reviews seem to cover so I will too.\n\nThe food: good, not mind-boggling, and certainly not proof of the existence of God. \nI had the rustic pasta which was salty, but satisfying. Then the veal ribeye which was like fatty pork. The bread was nice but not great. The wines by the glass were pretty good but a severely limited selection.\n\nThe service: very good. Perhaps this is the best thing about the restaurant. Very attentive and gentle. The waiter, busboys, sommelier and manager were all invested in making the experience a good one. As Lawrence Welk said: Thank you boys.\n\nThe room: cold and charmless...like eating in the terminal at La Guardia...except for the hanging glass bubbles which made me feel like I was in a glass of club soda.\n\nThe view: very nice, but because the restaurant is kind of on the side, the view from the MIx bar is better. As well, the tables are too close together so that it feels like everyone around you can listen to your conversation. No intimacy at Mix.\n\nThe biggest problem with Mix is that the food is way too expensive. \nI have one piece of advice, from someone who virtually eats out every night of the week...you will go out of business if you don't modify your price structure.\nRead the business section of any newspaper: prices that were accceptable in 2004 are irresponsible and verging on offensive in 2009."

It's not going to be any cheaper at a similarly nice club. The location is a double edged sword - being at the southern end of the strip gives a great view, but also keeps the place pretty empty. I'd say maybe half the tables were filled at the busiest hour of the night, and this is on halloween. There's a small dance floor that was lifeless for most of the night despite the awesome DJ. \n\nOne last note - the bathrooms have a view too! You can see the magnificent desolation that is the state of non-Vegas Nevada while pissing at the urinals. Not sure how that works out for the ladies, but I for one enjoy looking at a hundred miles of suburbs and deserts while urinating."

I really had no expectations for this place other than seeing the pictures and hearing that the lounge next to it, had a spectacular view.  It is due to this, that I was surprisingly impressed.   We had a 6 pm reservation, but as they still were not ready to seat us, we went to the Mix Lounge to wait. The view was spectacular.  One of the best views at night, as all the lights from strip is so hypnotizing. \n\nOnce we got seated, I was ready to eat, as I was famished.   My friend and I shared the duck confit and the seared foie gras.  The foie gras was so tasty and soft. It just melted in my mouth as I ate it.  The duck confit was also delicious, as you could taste the hint of truffles in it.  My entree was the braised bison with mixed vegetables and my friends the venison.  I really enjoyed the bison, as it was my first actually.   I was afraid that it would be dry, but ordering it rare really makes the difference.  We accompanied it with the sauteed mushrooms and their specialty \"elbow pasta with black truffle, ham and Gruyere cheese\".   I was happy that we ordered the \"mac & cheese\", as it was so good.  I haven't  eat \"mac & cheese\" for over 10 years, and this did not let me down. The ham really makes the dish.  It was so rich though, that we couldn't finish it.\n\nStuffed, I couldn't order dessert.   We both left the Mix with full stomachs as we dragged each other out only to gaze at the lite \"X\" by the elevator.  Yes, \"X\" does mark the spot here."

The vegetable eggroll is confusing and not the best eggroll I've ever had, but still a nice start to the meal.\n\nColorado Rack of Lamb: Great sear and cooked perfectly. The lamb comes deboned and is the highlight of the dish. Would definitely order again\n\nLobster \"Au Curry\": WOW. After a summer of endless Maine lobstah rolls, I didn't think I could enjoy lobster until next summer. I snuck a bite of my friend's order and loved the way they prepared the lobster. It had that great seafood flavor and firm texture, without being too rubbery. You wouldn't think of curry as something you want to spend $50 on, but there was so much flavor and the rice made the dish complete."

We were looking forward to trying the supposedly amazing French touch from Chef Ducasse at Mix, however nothing felt like a Michelin gastronomic restaurant. \nApart from the view of the Vegas strip, this restaurant is truly a waste of money and time. Especially in Vegas where we have found some true gems. \n\n1. The service was almost inexistent. Our server was extremely pushy and tried to increase the amount of our bill. However, it was pretty obvious what he was trying to do. When asked what are some of the best recommendations, he stated: \"Well, first I would start with a glass of champagne.\" In my head, I was thinking \"Dude, I asked you about the food!\" Then, he only recommended the tasting menu ($120 per person), without even mentioning the a la carte options. Apart from these two interactions, the waiter did not come see us at any time. \n\n2. Being familiar with French gastronomic restaurants and famous chefs (like Joel Robuchon), we were dying to see what Ducasse had in store at Mix. A serious lack of innovation and originality was what we noticed. My husband ate a cod that was not-memorable and I got the lobster curry. My dish cost around $50 and I swear when it arrived it literally looked like it had just been thrown onto a plate with no considerations for the aesthetics of the dish. Curry splashed all over, a mush of overcooked rice and just nothing that excites the eyes. While the lobster was abundant, the dish tasted like a curry dish I would have taken at a regular Thai restaurant (which would cost $10). I'm just glad we didn't try anything else. And those two dishes were supposed to be the top items that display Ducasse's \"genius\" abilities....\n\nOverall, it might be best for Ducasse to take his name out of this restaurant. My husband and I are huge foodies and we have tried top restaurants in every city we have visited, but this one is definitely not a place we would come back!"

(Her tip went up accordingly.) For some reason I ended up doing the worm on the dance floor. And I can't even do the worm! Thanks Goose!\n\nThe view is to die for. The patio/balcony was not open because of the wind. The music is good. The strange brain-like sea anemone above the bar is quite lovely as well.\n\nThe views from the bathroom are also excellent.

The dish also came with a side of mashed potatoes which I thought were ok but again amazing...Believe it or not, the hit of the night was the \"mac and cheese\",....you might be thinking \"wtf\", but yes, it was THAT good.  The macaroni was perfectly \"al dente\" and the cheese tasted tangy like gruyere but I forgot to ask...I highly recommend you try this.  I also got a chance to try my friend's chicken dish and I was amazed how good that was as well.  The skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.  I forgot what boutique California blend my friend ordered but it opened up nicely and made the steak and foie gras that much better.

The lounge has the nice view of Vegas.  As you pass the lounge, you pass the restaurants kitchen and get to another hostess that checks your reservation (kind of unnecessary, I think).  We waited for a little bit because we had to change the reservation to a smaller number. The restaurant is decorated nicely with clear bubble hanging from everywhere. The lighting is dim and romantic.  They say the dress is business casual but they let people with jeans in and funny holiday hats in as well (LOL!).  \n\nI decided to order the filet mignon because I wasn't too hungry and I wanted steak. My bf ordered the lobster au curry and the foie gras as an appetizer. My filet mignon was good (not the best of I've had), but definitely easy to cut and it tasted nice with the white sauce they give you to eat. The lobster curry was delicious as well as the foie gras.  The foie gras was rich as usual so I would recommend the half size if you are eating it yourself.  The coconut rice with the lobster was a little mushy for my liking, but the curry and lobster was good mix. \n\nFor dessert, my friends and I ordered the chocolate souffle. It was delicious and it looked like it was overflowing.  A good size to share with everyone. The rocky road ice cream that came with it was ok. and came with a merengue tasting cookie bits.  We also ordered the cheesecake. It tasted a little different (a little creamy vs. cream cheesy taste), but the sour cream sorbet and raspberry sauce that came with it was delicious.   \n\nBottom Line: Everything is pretty expensive. OUr bill came out to about $80 a person for 2 people.  I don't really think everything was worth the price though. View is excellent\n\nP.S. the bathrooms have floor to ceiling windows.

Beautiful white decor with a hint of old Hollywood elegance surround a grand spiral staircase encircling a modern glass chandelier. Breathtaking! \n\nOutstanding Service and the food is inspiring. Tantalizingly sophisticated and bursting with savory flavors. \n\nEverything is served a la cart so it's fun to share. Pricey but such is to be expected with restaurant like this. \n\nVegas is like a second home to me. You can get views of the strip just about anywhere but not like this! Simply Beautiful. \n\n\nA couple of weeks ago while vacationing in Las Vegas, I had the veal fillet with a creamy garlic sauce nestled on top of two different types of peas. This dish was immaculate. The veal was thickley-cut, tender, juicy and I savored each bite. \n\nWe also ordered mixed sauteed mushrooms (mmm), mac n cheese (not your mama's kind), and fish dishes. The macadamia nut encrusted halibut was fresh and flaked to perfection! \n\nDeliciously creative and refreshing cocktails are served at your dining table or the small bar lounge area with outdoor viewing deck you pass by on your way in. Try the Watermelon Martini!\n\nI had a truly beautiful night there."

It is located atop The Hotel so you would think, okay it might be not-so-great food but I'm sure a great view. Surprisingly NOT. There is a view on one side of the restaurant, yet for some reason the hostess decided to seat everyone at the opposite side of the restaurant. Whatever.\n\nSo this is supposed to be Alain Ducasse--what a travesty. I was almost inspired enough to write a letter to let him know of the horrible representation of his name. Just makes me think of him as yet another snobby money-hungry chef who plops his name on any proposition with zero accountability. No offense, Mr. Ducasse, but seriously I don't understand how anyone whose opinion mattered would walk away from a meal here thinking differently. \n\nFor everyone, please steer clear. You MUST steer clear. The food is HORRIBLE. I mean, not even par to a dinner off the strip or at Rio. I've never been to Rio, but it's all I could think of that reflects how disgusted I am with this place. \n\nAfter the worst dinner of my life, we walked down to Mandalay Bay and our hearts sank as we passed the lively nightlife with MANY great looking options down near the casino. I think the bf secretly wished we went to Stripsteak instead. But of course me, with my sometimes pretentious foodie attitude just HAD to go to Alain Ducasse. MISTAKE! I dunno about everyone else, but coming from NY and LA...BAD. Just saying."

What an improvement.\n\nPart of the empire of famed, multi Michelin stared chef Alain Ducasse, miX finally lives up to expectations.\n\nFor starters, the gnocchi is outstanding.  Soft pillows surrounded by earthy, wild mushrooms, vegital asparagus, enveloped in a brown butter / rendered bacon sauce.  A perfectly balanced dish.  The foie with dates and lemon confit is a true embarrassment of riches.  Thick slices from the best part of the lobe, perfectly seared, served in its own melting fat; the sweet, fruity dates compliment, the tart, acidic zing from the lemon peel refreshes the palate.  Wow.\n\nMains deliver.  The lamb loin is delicious.  Moist, tender, perfectly cooked and rested but it's the accompanying pomme Anna that makes the dish.  Layer after layer of paper thin potato cooked as a \"pie\" in butter with a crisp, brown top layer.  Incredibly rich and is the perfect foil to the lean loin.  Not into lamb?  The filet mignon Rossini with foie and black truffles...OMG!  The sweet beef flavor is brought out by the Rossini sauce and its umame enhanced by the truffles.  The foie provides the perfect, fatty, unctuous balance to the dish.\n\nExcellent service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.\n\nTip:  grab a drink on the balcony of the ultra lounge before dinner.  Incredible Strip view.  (Gets crowded later in the evening)\n\nHint:  high level Mlife members, for a window table, make reservations through the Mlife site.   Others, book at least 30 days in advance.  As is true on the Strip, be a baller.  A Benjamin (or a Grant in today's economy) goes a very long way getting THE table."

The layout of the lounge is damn cool and spacious so u never feel too crowded here. Bartenders make a nice stiff drink and usually a pretty good crowd of people in the joint.

I could give you my take on the view (sit outside if you can and don't mind the breeze - there are heat lamps too) but many of the pics speak for themselves. It's like you're on top of the world, or Vegas. Same thing, right?\n\nPICS: glad we showed up a bit after 5p as we got clearer shots but were also able to take more as it darkened and the city lit up.  If you have the right camera and/or settings you can capture images at night without the flash reflecting back on the glass.\n\nVIBE: I really liked the open-air setting on the balcony, it's something you don't necessarily get in other major cities that have rooftop-like dining establishments. Our seating set-up provided a relaxing and comfortable environment that enhanced the views even more. \"Styling & Profiling\" indeed! Dining inside doesn't seem too bad either.\n\n*Oh, I should mention that I chose Sunday night just a few mins after opening to get here and felt I had the best seat in the house.  So there is a bias to my review as it's from that limited perspective*\n\n~~**HAPPY HOUR 5-7p EVERY DAY= 15% off drinks & appetizers!!*~~\nDRINKS:\n-Pomegranate Manhattan: it was a good drink to start with, but had lots of ice in it so quantitatively it's more of a teaser. But what can I say, it's Vegas so it is what it is.\n-miXopolitan: Absolut citron and cranberries are featured in it. This was sweet and perhaps more satisfying when it comes to volume.\n-Beers: I didn't get any but they do have Stone IPA & Lagunitas, yay!\nFOOD:\n-Mini Beef Short Rib Tacos: w/ guacamole and cr\u00e9me fraiche OFY!!! Who doesn't like some cr\u00e9me fraiche? These tacos had a nice zing to them.\n-Sweet & Sour Duck Spring Rolls: I'm always happy whenever I can get some duck.\nPRICES: ended up reasonable for Vegas due to the HH discount. You don't go to a place this cool and expect cheap prices, so you may want to be here with the mindset that you're just going to enjoy your life and not worry about the $$$ for a bit.\nSERVICE: they represented their establishment well and checked up on us just at the right level of frequency. One girl in particular was pretty hot too.  Maybe it's a good thing she wasn't our server, or I would've been checking her out instead of the views!\n\nWhile reflecting before descending into the lobby en route to the airport, I couldn't help but come to the realization that The miX Lounge can be a special type of place that'd also be great to share with someone you really love - so if you're Kanye I guess that means you just go by yourself?"

I can remember about 3 of them: walnut raisin muffin, red pepper bread, and rustic loaf. The bread came with butter and homemade peanut butter. The waiter recommended the peanut butter with the walnut raisin muffin: good recommendation! It was fabulous! :)\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the scallops with pork and corn. The scallops and pork worked very well together. I was actually a little surprised! My fiance ordered the steak, it cut like butter. So yummy. I almost wished I had gotten the steak, but no, I was happy with my dish too. :)\n\nWe decided to skip on dessert, since we figured the calories in these dishes were enough for one day, but they wouldn't let us opt out!

The filet Rossini lacked sauce and was overcooked and a bit dry,  the lamb was so over flavored on the crust that only the center was tasty.  Excellent buttery potatoes and creamed spinach, the asparagus was good, but tasted mostly like butter..\n\nThe desserts were the most disappointing - the profiteroles were fair and the chocolate souffl\u00e9 dry, lacking in chocolate flavor and inedible (left almost completely uneaten, complained about and still charged).  The Madeleines were cute, but too dry and cakey, lacking the buttery-lemon flavor of true Madeleine fame (my Wife's are much better).\n\nService was about the same as the food.  The Sommelier was competent and the Turley Zinfandel excellent, although our waitress managed to spill some while pouring due to her seeming indifference.  We had an early dinner and the room was empty most of the time with too many servers per patron. At times they were overly anxious, at times good and at times intrusive - certainly not first rate.  You shouldn't clear one diner and not the table, but that wasn't the way things worked here.\n\nIt seemed like a new venture that hand't yet worked out the kinks, but hearing they'd been open for several years they have no excuses.\n\nLovely space, good view, have a drink, but forget the food, until they get serious about being a real first rate restaurant.  When a big name chef adds his name to a restaurant, I'd expect his continued involvement or at least a higher level of quality control.  His name now just means high prices.  He should learn from Thomas Keller and the French Laundry.\n\nReturned for hosted cocktails during the following week and the waitress smashed into my Wife's arm leaving a very nasty black and blue mark.

I'll get the food out of the way---we had two entrees that were both amazing, fish cooked to perfection with some very unique flavors...the rest of the experience was horrible and the food doesn't make up for it.  Here are a summary of my issues:\n1.  No one at the top of the elevator, and no staff in the bar so we sort of wandered around aimlessly until we walked through the dining room and found a host---and  she was rude and not very welcoming.  \n2.  She sat us at a table, our first interaction with a staff member was 20 minutes later when the waiter who was running around like he was the only one in the whole restaurant told us it would be just a second and he'd come over...\n3.  Another 20 minutes or so and he took our wine orders and told us the specials but didn't take our food order...\n4.  At that point I was ready to walk out and I am typically the one telling my boyfriend to relax etc and give people a chance, at this point I was like lets go...but we had planned this etc and were really looking forward to it and it was really late.  \n5.  We got our food, just the two entrees, after almost an hour and half---we skipped any apps at this point because we wanted to be done before breakfast.  Oh, and after an hour they brought our two glasses of wine, one of which was wrong (brought a red instead of the white we ordered) but we weren't going to attempt to see how long it would take for the correct one.  \n6.  They must have told them to push the desserts because after the entrees the waiter was all over us until we said no, at which point it again took way longer than necessary for him to get our check etc.  \n7.  After the experience I realized that I felt so tense during it because our waiter, who didn't have an absurd number of tables, and they were all just tables of two, was in such a tizzy he made me feel anxious and like I should be in a tizzy, only I was the one stuck with wine I hadn't ordered waiting for food.  \n8.  The people that were seated 45 minutes after us ordered after they had been at the table only 15 or so minutes---right after we got to order.  \n\nThe tables that were already seated when we got there all skipped dessert and it appeared had similar slow waiting experiences since they all seemed to have chatted enough to get to know one another and made comments to other tables about how they weren't going to wait for dessert.  \n\nComing from DC and being used to paying for restaurants on the expensive end Mix set a new low for HORRID service.  \n\nGo for it, tell the guys at the elevator downstairs that you want to go up and get a drink and look out the balcony, don't waste time paying for a drink, and skip the meal unless you want to commit hours of your life---honestly there are other places where you can pay less, get good food, get a view, and be treated like individuals who are respected and wanted.  \n\nMy advice, don't go and don't waste your time...oh but there is a cool view of the strip from the elevator which is on the exterior of the building."

This restaurant is at the top floor of Mandalay Bay and only accessible by elevator with glass walls looking over the strip and airport as you ascend.  We walked through the bar area and found the podium hidden around the corner.  We were originally sat at a round table next to a big pillar opposite of everyone else in the restaurant, so we asked to move to a table with a view.  They did have a sense of urgency in moving us, however, ended up putting us further to the back of the restaurant by window with a view of NOTHING!  Not to be particular, but it was my birthday, so my friend asked the server to move us again with a view of the strip.  We were then taken outside on the last table in the back. Our view was of the airport (meh...) and the hostess walked away and grabbed a server and whispered something to him. This hostess was a lady with greasy mullet with a very \"stand off-ish\" vibe.  No bueno.   Aside from this, here's what we got:\n\nI got the rack of Colorado lamb for $39.  It was cooked medium and perfect!  Served with eggplant and lamb au jus.  The flavors meshed well together.  Light, yet savory.  My friends had the braised wagyu (for $34) served in a small pot, with a flavorful gravy and veggies.  The wagyu was fork tender and AH-MAZE-ING!  My other friends had the venison and the ribeye.  Although I didn't try it, they seemed to enjoy the meal as well.  We also ordered three side dishes: 2 mac and cheese and french fries.  The fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, however the mac and cheese, serve with ham, was \"on point!\"  So cheesy, so flavorful, so good!!  All in all, I'd say the food was 5 star all the way!\n\nMix is a wonderful place to dine on a super special occasion, like MY birthday (LOL).  At the end of the day, I was thoroughly impressed with the potential this place has on the typical dining experience.  For our party, it seemed that the service fell short in a couple of places.  Our actual server, however, was very nice and engaging so I left I happy camper!"

(He was very nice, by the way) Oh my goodness, boy, we should've gone with our gut instinct.\nOur dinner included...\nFoie Gras (excuse my spelling): Buttered toast with Foie Gras and Pear Chutney and fleur de sal (salt) and peppercorns. Together, it was so delicious, the pear chutney was a little sweet on its own, however, in the mix it was delicious. The dish began to get a little salty towards, the end, so just ease up on the salt, and it was super rich and the liver was really rich, so delicious. My favorite dish!\nLobster Angel Hair: The angel hair was cooked perfectly, and the cream sauce was a little too rich, especially with the huge hunks of lobster it was served with.\nVeal: So perfectly cooked, it was really tender, and just slightly pink. The sauce was really fatty and rich, and it was served with slow cooked pearl onions, baby lettuce, and mushrooms... I skipped out on them because I was so incredibly stuffed. (I actually ate the slow cooked baby lettuce, it was really flavorful but super mushy)\nEggnog: With nutmeg, and Grand Marnier. This was such a delicious creamy delight, however, the drink was supposed to be a palette cleanser....for freaking Santa Claus. This was another rich dish.\nLastlyy!! \nBush de Noel: This wasn't your traditional one, this was a citrus themed one with vanilla bean ice cream, soaked sponge cake and orange sorbet. So delicious, but the cream exterior was wayy too sweet and sgary and the sorbet wasn't creamy, it was a little bitter.\n\n Long review for a delicious dinner, however the entire meal was terribly terribly rich, and I wish that it had a few palette cleansers and some more texture.\nLet's just say I don't need to eat heavy food for a month after this..."

Things were looking up.\n\nThe rocky road ice cream was aiiight, but the complimentary fresh-baked madeline's were aMAzing and just sweet enough.  Which, it turns out, is something they have in common with my date.  \n\nYum."

The restaurant is one of the most beautiful rooms I've ever had the change to be in.  The views outside in each direction are breathtaking, and the room itself is designed to look as if you are sitting at the bottom of a champagne glass full of bubbles.  The service was perfect, the waiter attentive and helpful.  All the other wait staff equally excellent.  There were 4 of us and each ordered something different.  Everyone raved about their choices.  Mine was the fish special of the day, delightfully prepared and presented.  Dessert choices were interesting but not the highlight of the meal.   I'd have my wedding reception on their outdoor balcony were I ever to get married again."

            "review": "I was invited here by some colleagues during a work retreat and treated to an extravagant place with over-the-top prices on food. There were many areas to MIX that ran the gamut of styles. First of all, the entrance to MIX was just a hallway to an outdoor elevator that shot up to the top of the hotel; by the way, it was hot! \n\nOnce we got in, there was the lounge and bar area which were club-like and very loud. Vegas, yes yes. We apparently were in the back past the kitchen so we moved from that very dark, very loud setting to a white bubbly restaurant area. Talk about modernized fancy schmancy - even our bread came with square pats of creamy butter and sweet peanut butter. By the way, the pimento bread was very excellent and good on its own without any spread. \n\nSo after trying to get a little comfortable in this unfamiliar setting of a swanky restaurant (and staring at the price tags on the food), I decided that since I was already in the situation, I ought to take full advantage of it. I mean, when else am I going to place myself there with a high-priced menu? Therefore, what else to order but one of the chef's signature dishes, the filet mignon rossini? It came with seared foie gras and sliced black truffles. Oh and I believe there was also a side of mashed potatoes for me too. When they came out, they honestly weren't presented in a way that made my mouth water (actually, the waiter set the plate down in front of me incorrectly with the insignia not turned properly). However, the tenderness of the steak certainly played its part in charming me. Was the best I've had though? No but the seared foie gras really helped pull the flavors together. Let's not forget the truffle! The mashed potatoes were also both fluffy and still chunky enough to please my palate. Now, was the whole entree worth $69? I'd say not. Was it delicious and juicy? Yes it sure was.\n\nI couldn't resist getting dessert with such wonderful descriptions listed on the menu (turn a blind eye to the price tag, Minerva!). I ended up with a hazelnut souffle paired with grapefruit sorbet. Uh, who pairs the two together? I was hoping that I'd get them in some kind of complex mix but alas, they were presented separately on one plate. The hazelnut souffle had too much sugar in some parts so that it was unnecessarily cavity-inducing crunchy. I really enjoyed the sorbet but felt that it was odd to include the bits of sugar in the bowl. The candied grapefruit peel was delicious but again, too sweet. I'm glad I had the experience here but once again was proven correct in my thought that the cost and high profile appearance of a place does not say anything about the food. It's all about the diner, and this diner was only somewhat satisfied that night."

            "review": "First dinner of the New Year @Mix. We came for the view and the food and the restaurant did not disappoint.  \n\nA private glass elevator takes you directly to the top while you enjoy the view on the ascent to the 65th floor. It was a little confusing arriving in the dark and walking thru a long bar/club area and then past the kitchens before we were greeted (a hostest was not present at the booth either so we were confused on where to go). However, we did eventually find our table. The decor is a curtain of glass bubbles with white and red accents.  This place looked ready for a great valentine's day date. \n\nOur cheerful and friendly server arrived soon after we were seated in our booth and was eager to please us. Throughout our service, he provided detailed descriptions about the dishes and knowledgeable explanations about how each entree was prepared.  He was as excited talking about the food as we were to try it!\n\nWe started with the crab salad.  It had all my favorite ingredients (fresh crab, avocado, cilantro, cucumber, etc) but there was a lingering bitter aftertaste that we could not place. It distracted from the flavors of the dish and we were ready to move on to the  next course.\n\nFor the main course, I tried the rack of lamb/tenderloin with a tian of eggplant.  The lamb was so flavorful and tender (prepared seared and then sous vide) on a bed of caramelized onions with tomato and the eggplant, tomato tian was bursting with fresh flavor that complemented the lamb well.  My husband ordered the atlantic seabass in a shellfish sauce.  Also well prepared (seared and then baked) with melt in your mouth flavors. \n\nEvery meal should end on a sweet note and Mix reserves a whole page of their menu just for dessert!  I ordered the profiteroles for one.  It's 6 mini cream puffs served with some homemade chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  It reminded me of a \"deconstructed\" eclair. My husband opted for the signature mix candy bar. Covered in chocolate with gold leaf and delicate wafer thin slices inside - it's a candy bar to eat with a fork, if only to savor it a little bit longer. The lime coconut sorbet that comes with the candy bar is more lime than coconut and provides a tart contrast (maybe too much) to the delicately sweet candy bar.  Compliments of our server, we received another delight with a freshly baked lemon madeleine (served right out of the pan) to dip in chocolate spread to top off our evening. \n\nAs you stroll along on your way out, there are bathrooms tucked away just before the elevator. In the ladies room, two of the stalls have floor to ceiling windows for you to gaze outside as you go about your business (I'm told there's a similar set up in the men's room).  It takes a moment to remind yourself that it's one-way glass and what you really came to the ladies room to do. \n\nAll in all, dinner at Mix was a great start to the new year. \n\nSummary: Delicious food, awesome views, great service. Definitely would recommend to a friend and we will return again."

I ordered my usual (gnocchi and the chocolate souffle) and was disappointed with all of it. The gnocchi was over cooked and mushy, the vegetables that were paired with them were winter vegetables in the middle of July. It was very strange. The chocolate souffle was a bit dry, in fact, the pistachio ice cream that I had mentioned being a distraction 3 years ago was the better part of the dish :(  Cocktails were still good (Thanks, Shaggy!) and I tried a side of the asparagus which was delicious. Service was a little bit strange but nothing major. \n\nNot sure what's going on at MIX but I hope it gets sorted out soon since I always send lots of people here when they're visiting Las Vegas."

Luckily, we were staying in Mandalay bay so we just walked up to MIX and went up to the elevator which took us to the 64th floor.\n\nFirst off, the lounge at Mix is amazing! Since Mandalay is at the end of the strip, you get a full view of the strip and you can really appreciate the lights of Vegas. Additionally, the chairs are comfy and the heat lamps will keep you cozy.\n\nAs for the restaurant, the decor is all white and very chic. You start out by walking through the open kitchen which is really cool. We were able to get a table next to the window, which made no difference since our backs were to the windows.\n\nAs for the food:\n\nAssorted bread with sea salt butter and peanut butter- 5/5- Hey it's free bread, anything at this restaurant that is free is a 5/5 for me. XD\n\nFoies Gras filet mignon- 5/5- For $60, I was pretty disappointed when the plate came out and there was a tiny piece of meat. However, this baby must be made from dehydrated food because it expands quickly in your stomach! The foie gras pretty much melts in your mouth and the flavor is really strong and decadent. I definitely, recommend this dish at MIX.\n\nMash potatoes- 3/5- Pretty plain. Kind of tastes like instant mash potatoes to me...\n\nCreamy Spinach- 3/5- Nothing out of the ordinary here.\n\nWagyu Beef- 4/5- This baby just melts in your mouth. However, it's a little bit salty for my taste. Luckily, the potatoes and carrots offset some of the saltiness.\n\nOverall, the food is overpriced; however, the dishes are very flavorful here and the decor and view is top notch. If you're tired of the buffet scene, this is definitely, a worthy try."

The decor and the views are amazing. You come here for that, rather than the food. Not the the food is bad, it's just pretty expensive. Apps are around $30 and entrees are in the $50 range.\n\nThe lounge doesn't charge cover before 10, so you get some of a trailer park crowd before then. \n\nAs usual the dishes are rated 1 - 10, 10 being amazing.\n\n$12 Chivas\nGood pour and quick service\n\n$0 Bread Basket (6)\nNice variety, warm and fresh. Comes with hard butter and peanut butter. The peanut butter just doesn't work.\n\n$33 Foie Gras, Apple (6)\nIf you like foie gras, this was a decent choice. My friend had never tried foie gras and liked it. Nice thick cut.\n\n$28 Gnocchi, Morels (8)\nI was pleaantly surprised by this dish. I heard it was bland. I thought it was great.\n\n$52 Bison Tenderloin (4)\nNothing special, such a straight-forward steak with a peppercorn sauce.\n\n$75 Beef Tenderloin, Foie Gras, Truffle (5)\nOne of the special of the night. Basic preparation with expensive ingredients. It was decent.\n\n$44 Seared Tuna, Carrot (4)\nNothing special. I wouldn't order this dish. It's just seared tuna.\n\n$51 Rack of Lamb (5)\nThe lamb was prepared well, but again nothing special and very straight-forward for $50.\n\n$59 Beef Tenderloin (4)\nNot sure how they priced this one. Same story, good straight-forward dish, but you're really paying for the decor.\n\n$55 Halibut, Foie Gras, Truffle (5)\nThis was my pick. The halibut was ok, a little bland, but was made up by the foie gras and truffle sauce. \n\n$12 Elbow Pasta, Guyere, Ham (6)\nIt's hard to go wrong with this dish. It was good, but I don't go to a nice restaurant to get mac 'n' cheese.\n\n$12 Forked Potatoes (3)\nJust plain expensive for potatoes and butter. Not that good.\n\n$77 The Cake (3)\nThe didn't make the cake, but to cut it and throw some ice cream on each slice, they charged $7 a person.\n\nThe service was great and very attentive and friendly. As it should be for the large group  20%. \n\nOverall, good place to celebrate a special occasion and hang out at the lounge afterwards. But, there are better places in a Vegas for the food, especially at these costs."

Great food, great service, in a dramatic room with modern lighting, furnishings and floor to ceiling glass. The waiters were going all out to earn their tips and everyone left happy, full and delighted. Frankly one the better experiences I've had in a \"high end\" Vegas eatery in YEARS! Menu has a wide variety from mild to wild. Standouts included lobster ceaser, tuna tar-tar, foie-gras, chicken surf and turf with stuffed chicken breast and crabmeat...  After, or before, spend some time in the amazing bar that is attached with the same outstanding strip views. AAA wine list and good strong cocktails. Worth the wait and every penny, I'll go back. figure $75-100 per person + drinks. \n\nOne small gripe - we made a reservation - they did not have it when we got there - they seated us the lounge, we had a drink and they gave us a great table w/in ten minutes, so -  no harm no foul. Also, the chairs are weird. Small and high design, but too low, so that I, at only 6ft tall, felt like I was squatting, legs kind of tucked under me, they should allow full leg extension but don't so I'll assume a small Asian or Itallian guy picked them."

I read in several other reviews about the poor service - this is unfortunately quite true!  It took an hour and a half for us to get our food and we only ordered entrees.  Most ladies at our table ordered steaks and when one of them was not prepared according to how it was ordered we were given attitude from the server like it was our fault.  The manager was able to get 'approval' from the head chef to remove the uncooked steak from our bill.  We had also asked if we could move to a table outside as there were several open ones and we were told that it was not possible.    \n\nAverage cost of an entree is $50 - you expect fabulous food and service for this price - I do not recommend dining here if you want an experience worth your time and money.   There are plenty of other wonderful restaurants in Vegas that will far exceed your expectations and blow this place out of the water.  The food wasn't even that good and paying $40 for 8 pieces of gnocchi is outrageous.  Go somewhere else!"

They surprised me with a birthday dinner reservation at the well known Mix.  This restaurant is located at the top of the THEhotel (on the 64th floor!!!!) adjoining Mandalay Bay.  What this means is that the view is OUTSTANDING because it faces the entire strip.  Outstanding or maybe breathtaking?  Hard to say which one.  This restaurant is truly stunning.  Example:  your view of the strip is a complete 360 thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows, which are everywhere including the bathroom.  Make sure you visit the bathroom!\n\nLet's start with the 24 foot chandelier that has literally 15,000 hand blown glass spheres.  Beautiful.  The entire interior is chic modern, and almost glows like the sheen you see on bubbles.  Attached to the restaurant is the lounge, which has an open deck facing the strip where you can get the best views.  \n\nNext, the food:  exquisite.  World famous French chef Alain Ducasse is at the helm at Mix and he does not disappoint.  Most everything here is French based, and our table partook in all the high points of the menu from the soups to the steaks to the foie gras.  (And for the record yes I felt guilty eating foie gras).  There is nothing on this menu that you could order and not love.\n\nMix was kind enough to let my friends bring over a birthday cake from Freed's bakery and they cut up the cake and served it for us.  Our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable.  This is a must place to eat and see the views when in Vegas."

We were a group of 6 and to be honest had no intentions of getting a table but the deal  was just too good to pass up. I am so happy we got a table because the view was to die for. We had the option of sitting outside or in. We chose in because it was a little windy that night but we were able to go out on the roof anytime we wanted to smoke and take pics. The atmosphere was really nice in Mix and the music that night was perfect! They ended up putting on a few birthday songs right at midnight when my husband turned 30. I thought that was very sweet of them. We ended up buying a bunch of diff. drinks throughout the night and all of them were really good. We have been to Vegas numerous times and this was by far my favorite lounge. Def. put it on your must do list when in Vegas."

A little about the bathroom, its all black and when you walk up to the urinal, you are looking right out of the window down onto the city.  Pretty bad ass.  I have enoyed many nights and the DJ plays a good variety of HipHop/Club Music to keep the momentum up.  Did I mention the outdoor balcony?  It is partially available for clubbers and partially for bottle service members.\n\n****If you are reading this review and are considering making a trip here, take one thing into consideration.  TheMix while cool, is not at the top of the club scene in Vegas.  With that said, there are nights when the crowds are very low, thus taking away from the party atmosphere.  Friday and Saturday nights are a safe bet, but weekdays have, you should have a back up plan.  Would hate for you to drag a party of people here on a Wed night, only to find 30 people in the club."

I think the food is delicious, but the price is a bit much for the overall quality. The best thing on the Menu has to be the Buffalo steak seasoned with black pepper. It's an great spot if you want to impress a client who's already tried all the fine restaurants in Las Vegas. The view is amazing from the bar and dining are, but most people are very impressed by the look and feel of place. The dining room is all white with a few hints of red or black with hundreds of glass balls hanging from the ceiling. \n\nI noticed a small dance floor and a DJ booth so I'm sure it's an amazing place to spend the evening dancing."

I should have written this sooner so I could remember the details better, so apologies in advance for the made up names I'm using for the dishes! \n\nStarted out with tuna sashimi appetizers and one of our party got the shrimp cocktail. Tuna sashimi appetizer had TONS of tuna on it. Seriously the portion was huge and an awesome value. Tuna was fresh and tasty. Dish wasn't super exciting or mind blowing.. but no complaints. People enjoyed the shrimp cocktail as well.\n\nFor mains we had the chicken, steak, and the cod. The cod was a tad rich and buttery for my taste, but it was well prepared and yummy. Steak was VERY good. For a non-steakhouse, I was very impressed. Chicken diner wasn't very excited by his chicken.\n\nDessert: the floating island didn't do it for me.. ehhhh.. kinda weird, not that tasty. The candy bar was ok, but not good enough for me to even eat half of. They gave away some sort of fresh baked madeleines with nutella at the end..  it was far yummier than any of the \"real\" desserts. I advise not to pay for a dessert but just eat the freebie one.. much better. \n\nView was amazing outdoors, but as many have said, it's so freaking hot in the summer! We dined in september and were miserable. Seriously can't they put out some sort of classy misting system or something.. WAY too hot during the summer! I'm sure it's lovely in october though."

            "review": "I was here years ago with my fiancee and had a very nice time.  But this review pertains only to my experience in mid-January.\n\nWe were a group of three couples with an 8:30 dinner reservation.  We had a couple drinks beforehand and showed up at 8:25.  They had us wait about ten minutes while they found us a table.  Then we were walked over to the patio door and told to wait.  When we realized they were intending to seat us outdoors, we declined.  (It was below 50 degrees outside and two of the ladies were wearing skirts, so we knew the space heaters would not suffice.)  We were a bit put off by the fact that they didn't even ask us if we were okay with sitting outside.\n\nSo we waited by the check-in area for a while longer until a table was ready.  WARNING to Yelpers: If you are a party of SIX, be prepared for a really tight fit.  We were seated at a small round table that would've been comfortable for four and snug for five.  With six people, not only are you elbow to elbow, but there's barely enough room on the table for breadsticks and wine glasses let alone multiple appetizers.  We tried to switch tables but were told the request could not be accommodated.  I noticed another group in the same predicament, so I'm not saying we were mistreated; just keep in mind that if you ever visit with a party of six, it would behoove you to fight for them to put multiple wall/booth tables together for you.\n\nBy this time it didn't take us long to figure out what we wanted.  However when we told our server, he informed us he was busy with a birthday and that a different server would be over shortly.  For the rest of the meal we had two servers, which meant multiple visits from them within minutes followed by times when we wouldn't see them for quite a long time.\n\nSo we chit-chatted and ate our appetizers and we finally reached a silent moment during which we realized our food was taking a long time.  We were proactive and asked our server about it and were told that it was \"almost ready\".  I don't know how much longer we waited, but it was quite a while.  For this group with an 8:30 reservation, we finally got our entrees at 9:50pm!  Had we not sought out our servers several times, who knows how long it would have taken.  By this time, most of the restaurant had emptied out and we thought about asking to be moved to one of the nearby large tables, but we did not want to delay things anymore than they already were.\n\nI was asked multiple times if I would like a glass of wine since I kept the drink menu.  I kept telling them I'd order when the food came, but my buzz had been completely killed by that time, so I didn't even bother.\n\nThe entire ordeal sort of ruined our night as we tried to rally with some drinks back at the room afterwards, but we were so exhausted, we didn't bother with the Mix lounge and it was all we could do to head downstairs and gamble for half an hour.\n\nAll in all, the service was friendly, the food was as good as you would expect for the prices, and the restaurant itself was pretty neat.  But the lengthy delays and the cramped situation made my fiancee and I feel pretty guilty that we had spoken so highly of the restaurant and convinced the other couples to come all the way down the strip to eat here."

However it's below my expectations in 2 areas - first the music / DJ was so-so, maybe only that night I was there, it was a Saturday night though.  The music was hard to dance with and the dance floor was very small.  Second is the fact that they have all the tables near the window marked as bottle service only.  So you can never get close to the window to enjoy the view, they don't even let you stand closer to the window.  It's a perfect place to be for a group or if you're planning to have bottle service."

It's the type of amazing a photograph can't capture, you have go up there and see it for yourself. The food was nothing short of excellent. I had the gnocchi for appetizer and the filet with foie gras. I was so happy and full by the end. \n\nThe service was also excellent. i went a while back with a group of friends who were still in college. I already knew we were a group of obnoxious students and I could tell the waiter was very frustrated with us, but he patiently endured through the whole time :P By the end I think he was more amused by us than annoyed."

The quick, drastic elevation change plugs my ears a little bit every time.\n\nThe night view (it's only open for dinner) of the city and south end of the strip is pretty fantastic from both the dining and lounge areas, and the lounge includes an outdoor patio.\n\nThis 1 star Michelin-rated (in addition to other awards) dining experience offers a medium sized American/French based menu.\n\nI enjoyed the roasted duck breast with fig as my entree.  It was tender, rich, tasty, and surprisingly filling for such a small portion.  This could also be a result of filling up on the (free) bread with butter and peanut butter that is included, and from boozing beforehand.\n\nReservations are strongly suggested.  Unless it's a slow night (which is not the norm), you're not getting in without them.  Also, plan on making the reservations many hours (if not days) before your dinner.  I've been denied on more than one occasion by procrastinating until the 11th hour.\n\nBecause it's Vegas, you can get away with moderately casual dress.  However, this is a very high end restaurant where dressing up would be more than appropriate.\n\nPlan on spending somewhere between $40 to over $100 per person for food alone depending on your hunger level and tastes.\n\nSurprisingly, MIXX offers a generous discount at Restaurant.com -  http://www.restaurant.com/rdc/mandalay-bay-resort-mix-in-las-vegas-las-vegas-french-restaurant-rid=357835.  Search Fatwallet.com for a promo code to get the Restaurant.com $50 certificate down to around $5 or less.\n\nFinally, by dining at MIXX, you're free to enter the lounge/club afterwards and avoid the cover charge.  Although it looked interesting, there was money to be made at the poker tables below, so I opted out of dancing and drinks with the ballers."

It was a few months ago so don't remember everything ordered, but it was all great.  I will always remember, however, my entr\u00e9e.  A ribeye with foie gras, black truffles, and bourbon sauce.  Giant pieces of perfectly seared foie gras.  Mounds of truffle shavings.  Perfectly prepared steak.  One of the best dishes I have ever had.\n\nI have developed an affinity for staying at TheHOTEL, but staying there in the future is going to incite a pitched battle between my soul, pulled by the siren song of Mix, and my wallet."

Better to pay in $ than in Euro. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, so fitting for special occasion or to impress your date. The restaurant is at teh 64th floor of the THE hotel next to Mandalay Bay. They share a parking garage, but different lobby. The restaurant has 360 glass window so you should be able to enjoy Vegas night view wherever you sit. The interior is all white with this blown glass cubes coming down from the ceiling.\nThe food is pretty good. I ordered one of the signature appetizer: the japanese sea bream sashimi with popcorn. The sashimi is seasoned well, better than what i had at Le Bernardin in New York. For my entre, I ordered teh $75 fillet mignon topped with foei gras and black truffle. I did get generous portion of foei gras and black truffle shavings. The black truffle is great but the foei gras was too big, too rich. It was a good dish, but you get what you paid for. I wish i had ordered Alain Ducase's specialty, the lobster curry thing. \nMy partner ordered chicken/lobster surf and turf, and his dish was excellent. Crispy skin on the chicken but still moist.\nIn the French Super Chef battle, I think Joel Robuchon wins out by a mile. Still need to try Guy Savoy at the Caesar Palace and Twist by Pierre Gagnaire at the new Mandarin Oriental. Pierre Gagnaire's restaurant in Paris is usually in the top 10 restaurants in the world."

So when we were going to Magic, I knew I had to make our team dinner at Mix. Their view is incredible, the restaurant is cute/modern, and it's definitely trendy. \n\nThe one thing that I have to complain about is the service. It's GOD AWFUL. They are so slow I can't stand it. We waited over an hour for our food to come out. My boss complained to the manager, and they just comped a bottle of wine, without very much regard or apology. For a Michelin Rated restaurant, this is a big no no. The waiter didn't even acknowledge that our food was going to be late, or offer any explanation as to why it took so long. \n\nOk, now that I got my rant aside, I'll move onto the food/drinks\n\nI stuck to the skinny girl margaritas, and they were just ok. It wasn't mixed very well (alcohol was at the way bottom), and it wasn't something I wanted to devour immediately. \n\nFor appetizers, we got the  macaroni and cheese with ham and lobster casesar salad. The salad was fresh, and tasty. The mac and cheese? Not so much. It was runny, and just not good. No cheesy goodness there. You can skip that.\n\nFor entrees, I got he pepper crusted bison tenderloin with glazed vegetables and black pepper sauce. The meat was cooked very well, medium rare, super soft, but that pepper crusted part was so peppery that it was overpowering. All I could taste was the pepper, and it definitely took away from the entree. As for sides, we got the creamy spinach and the fork crushed potatoes. Sides were good, but nothing to die over. \n\nAt this point, our meal was getting to be so long I wanted it to be over (we were approaching hour 3). But they gave us homemade madelines and chocolate, and this passion fruit \"drink\" served in a martini glass with foam. Just too much dessert that I didn't even want. We quickly tried that, and asked for the bill. My boss paid for it, so I can't tell you exactly how much it was, but 6 people was about $500."

However, on the restuarant side, there are only a handful of tables that give you the strip view.\n\nNevertheless, the food was very good, albeit very pricey.\n\nWe shared the following:\n\nTuna tartare on guacamole with taro chips - This dish reminds me of the tuna tartare at Tasca in Los Angeles, though not quite as tasty.  The tuna was incredibly fresh (considering we're in the desert) but the guacamole slightly overpowered its flavor.  The taro chips were super thin and a great base for the tartare.\n\nPotato Gnocchi with Asparagus and Morel Mushrooms - I have never had such flavorful morel mushrooms in my life.  However, the gnocchi had a slightly grainy texture and the asparagus was cooked unevenly.  Flavors were great, but I don't think I'd recommend this dish.\n\nBeef Rossini - Oh my freakin heart.... steroid-free, naturally raised prime filet mignon topped with seared foie gras and black truffle reduction.  The dish, as you could imagine, was super rich and loaded with heavy flavors.  I enjoyed it to the last bite... however, it wasn't until we got the check that I found out it was a $77 item on the menu.  Ouch.  But soooo good.\n\nFresh baked madeleine with chocolate-nutella sauce - Best madeleines I've had in my life, served to us fresh off the baking tray.  I could eat 3 trays of this to myself.  The chocolate nutella blend was DELICIOUS, and I'm usually not a big nutella fan.\n\nWine - We had 5 glasses of wine.  They were divine!  Their by-the-glass selection is very well thought out and I don't believe there is a single bad choice you could make.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal.  The service was amazing.  Every single person on their staff was attentive and friendly.  We never went a moment without somebody making sure we were enjoying our meal.  And I must also mention that the portions are huge (for this type of restaurant).  We split all three items we ordered, and the split portions were as large as most restaurants serve in full.\n\nIf it weren't for the price ($250 for the above... remember, we split the dishes), I'd easily give this place 5 stars.  However, if you want a great view and a great meal on the strip and $$ is not an important factor, Mix will NOT disappoint."

Music is mostly top 40 mixes with a few bass-heavy bump 'n grind songs mixed in. \n\nJust my opinion, but as a lounge with such a spectacular view, it would improve the atmosphere quality and ambiance greatly if they would play gentler music more suited to the view and the decor. \n\nMeh. Lately I've found myself really bored, even slightly annoyed, with the club scene. Everything is the same, and so mediocre.

They serve a generous mixed bread dish w/sides of butter and an amazing home made peanut butter. \n\nWe didn't spend $100/each, it was much less than that, although we didn't have cocktails with dinner since we had a long night ahead of us. If I could go back I would definitely would order a glass of wine, would be the icing on the cake. We ordered espresso at the end of our meals and they gave a small complimentary cookie/chocolate sauce dip w/it. All in all, can't wait to go back! Wish it was a little more crowded but maybe it was the timing. Stopping back next door afterwards was awesome in the lounge they have with the amazing view! We got amazing aerial vegas strip pix."

I promptly spit it out and sent the dish back.  The waitress brought back the SAME dish reheated including THE PIECE I SPIT OUT!!!  Yeah you read it right!  Reheated undercooked shell fish with a pre-chewed piece presented back to me with garnish on top!  I gracefully rejected the dish again and ordered the barramundi (btw very very bland dish).  Meanwhile I'm waiting another 20 min as I'm watching my boyfriend eat his entree.  There was no offer of apologies or any sort of hospitality up to this point.  The only thing the manager did was come by and say \"barramundi ok?\"  The meal ends with our dishes uncleared for a good 15 minutes.  Still no apologies directed at our dining experience and no gesture of hospitality.  So when the check came we had a chat with the manager about how disappointing our dining experience had been, he just stared at us stoned faced and said \"I took the lobster off your check didn't I?\"  That about sums it up."

We went to vegas for my daughters birthday like every year since she turned 21 (now 27) I made reservations at Joel Robuchon, Alize, and Mix and honestly taste wise, Mix was my favorite! oops I hate to even say that but it had what I expected French food to have which was lots of tasty sauces. Robuchon was in its own class and I will review it later. But I would recommend trying Mix. \nwe had the tasting menu which at that time was a gnocchi, lobster and filet and it was all awesome. the problem with trying to write review 6 months later is I cant remember everything but I do know it was my favorite.\nThe place is beautiful but they sat us in the back behind one of the huge seats so our view sucked.

            "review": "\"This is what Vegas is all about\" my fiance uttered as we walked into the Lounge area at Mix.\n\nMy review is for the Mix Lounge only.  It was about 8PM on Sunday night.  It was Labor Day weekend so we expected somewhat of a crowd.  Based on past yelp reviews I was eager to make it to Mix Lounge and didn't care what I had to do to get there.  Luckily, there was a huge wait at Burger Bar, so I was able to convince my fiance to stop in at Mix Lounge for a pre dinner drink.\n\nLet me preface - we are NOT the clubbin types AT ALL.  Our preferences range from drinking beers at a local dive bar, to listening to top 40 at a swanky lounge sippin a cocktail or single malt scotch.  But the packed like sardines wall to wall club style where all the guys are dressed the same and the girls are looking for rich guys is NOT for us.  More along the lines of where Frank Sinatra would've smoked a cigar and sang to an intimate crowd.\n\nThe Mandalay Bay was super busy and we did see an overabundance of club shirts walking around.  I could tell there was some hesitation on my bf's face but I would not deterred.  I had read that the place doesn't really get crowded until after 10PM, and they don't charge cover until then either.  But even if you did want to visit Mix after 10PM, there are a ton of Mandalay Bay promoters handing out free cover and line passes throughout the hotel.  So avoiding cover doesn't seem to be a problem.\n\nThe experience to get to the Mix Lounge can be confusing I have to admit, yet exciting at the same time.  Mix Lounge and Restaurant is actually atop The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, and there is a cool red sign that makes it visible to the passerby.  We made the mistake of taking a right and heading towards the elevators to the actual hotel rooms (we weren't the only ones), as opposed to taking a left and heading to the express elevator to Mix.  Riding in the elevator was an experience in itself because it is literally on the 64th floor!\n\nWhen we finally arrived, we walked through the gorgeous restaurant to get to the lounge.  The restaurant decor was soo beautiful - white furniture and flooring with white twinkle lights all around.  Dimly lit and something straight out of a movie.  Although we did not dine, and probably never will, it was an amazing sight.  We walked passed the kitchen and within a few steps - entered a dark room with awesome red chairs and lighting.  To the right - a huge bar.  To the left - the most amazing view of the Las Vegas strip, EVER.  We have stayed at the Signature at MGM Grand and stood on the balcony of our room.  We've stayed at the Palms Place and stood on the balcony of our room. But nothing comes close to the view at the Mix Lounge.  It truly is phenomenal - being located at the end of the strip allows you to see all of Las Vegas in front of you (Bellagio, Paris, the City Center).\n\nIt was basically empty at 8PM on a Sunday which is sad, but a plus for us since we aren't really into the crowds and the loud music.  And we don't like having to wait forever to get a drink.  We were greeted by super nice bartender who promptly brought us our beers (they do have Guinness and Sierra Nevada - and for $8 a beer we found that extremely reasonable, considering we had paid almost twice that at the House of Blues the night before)!  Unfortunately, we had a prior commitment off the strip and knew we had to drive - but if we hadn't - we would've gone for a stronger more potent cocktail.  They seemed to have a wonderful selection of alcohol, ranging from single malt scotches to a wide variety of vodka.\n\nAnd then, we just took it all in.  Sitting at the bar, drinking our beverages, listening to laid back music, a view of the entire strip capturing our attention.  There were tables with booths in front of us - a very romantic setting. I could see ourselves sitting in a booth, just staring out at Vegas all night.  It was a surprisingly comfy feel for being a Vegas Lounge.  There is also a patio that you can walk onto to take a picture.  We took many.  In the very back of the lounge is a cool dance floor.  I am not sure how busy it gets busy later on - or how much the dance floor gets used - but it was a cool area.\n\nAfter we finished our beverages, we reluctantly paid our tab and left. Again, our bartender was super nice and took our picture.  We then took the elevator we were supposed to use originally.  It's a non-stop express elevator that literally takes you through 64 floors in a matter of seconds.  It is located by the dance floor, and this allows you to avoid walking through the restaurant.  The elevator is all glass so on your way up, or down, you can see the strip all lit up and gorgeous as it should be.\n\nAll in all - we had an amazing experience at Mix Lounge. It was just what we were looking for - a breathtaking start to a Las Vegas night."

All of the other dishes (Seabass with asparagus, tenderloin with foie gras, and traditional bhaba rum cake) were all very tasty."

I'm a lover of truffles and foie gras so we ordered one each. The waiter delivered our appetizers I'd rate it as 3.5 stars I got the pasta with braised beef. Now about the main course. The $75 steak was good, nothing special but nothing bad about it. The foie gras was actually duck foie gras. Duck foie gras costs a fraction of what goose foie gras costs and it tastes substantially subpar to it's goose counterpart. The truffle shavings were not fresh and the type you would buy online or eBay for $5-$10 one black truffle. Pretty much it was the lowest possible quality truffle and foie gras you can buy. In my opinion they could have spent $2-$4 more in ingredients when they charge $75 a dish. I had a hard time eating it knowing that most Americans didn't know much about foie gras and truffle. It felt like a complete scam and rip off. Service was mediocre they did not refill our sparkling water. Also we made a reservation through their online system and the lady told us we didn't have one. But we were allowed to sit right away. The only thing I can say about this place is that the view is great and the indoor decor was quite fancy. Don't come here if you are looking for quality food, you will be disappointed."

Not cheesecake factory portions, but just enough to fill you up! \n\nMy only complaint and the reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the seating. Even though we got a window seat, it was so tight that I felt like I was sitting on the other table's lap. It was uncomfortable for both parties because there was no privacy and it was just way too close for comfort.

It can easily be shared by two folks.\n\n-I found that the meat dishes (duck, beef, and pork) outshined the seafood alternatives. I am particularly fond of the artisan pasta with duck appetizer -- a must-do for all duck lovers.\n\nWine list features plenty of good wine by the glass options.

Sure, you have to get bottle service if you want to sit with a view of the strip, but how many other Vegas clubs have this view? \n\nWe were originally all standing around the front of the bar not realizing that we could go around back where we found amazing seating for all six of us. Apparently, not too many people know you can go around back so it was fairly empty. So we had a cocktail waitress serving us all night and had a really fun time.\n\nSure, the drinks were expensive but it's Vegas people! Most clubs have similar pricing. \n\nThe view from the bathroom stalls (women) were spectacular. You could go to the bathroom while looking out the window in the last two stalls. Also, the bathrooms had an attendant who kept it clean (as opposed to many bathrooms at clubs in Vegas).

Nice touch.\n\nMain - Chicken\n\nI was told they feed it milk and not greens so it is much more moist. And it was very good, not as good as the Jean Georges moist chicken that is my standard. But a very complete plate --- the cous cous, veggiesn different presentation of the chicken. A very satisfying dinner plate.\n\nDessert - Mix candy bar\n\nDelicious (unless you don't like hazelnut).

Reminded me of the highly recommended hazelnut dessert at The Modern in nyc.\n\nPost dinner sweet -- Fresh madeline with chocolate spread.\n\nNice touch and very fresh.\n\nAll in all an excellent meal. Great value in my opinion as well. In fact, if you want to get a taste of high end dining, be full when you leave, have an amazing ambiance, do the chicken and a dessert here ---- at 39 dollars is about as good as it gets. Recommend."

Next was the gnocchi...best I ever had.  the potato gnocchi was so smooth and flavorful...not chewy like most places.  Then they served lobster curry on bed of coconut rice.  They gave large pieces of lobster.  You can literally smell the sweet aroma of lobster as they were serving it.  Next course was filet mignon topped with foie gras and truffle.  Steak was tender, but most impressive was the size of the foie gras on top of the steak.  cooked perfectly.  Don't taste too much of the truffle though.  The dessert was ba ba rhum (sponge cake topped with rum and cream)...the only low point of the meal.  sponge cake was good, but the whole dessert was plain.\n\nThe decor is modern contemporary...the view is amazing.  on the top floor of THE hotel (next to Mandalay Bay).

If you're seated away from the dance floor, the volume of music is not too loud which is great for being able to have a conversation. I just didn't love the mix of music. I think it's probably for people younger than me (and I'm under 30) based on the (few) people out on the dance floor. I did go up to the DJ to request some other music, and he said the establishment frowns upon playing hip hop music...but he did oblige us with some Biggie, 50 cent, and Dr Dre. As soon as he stopped playing that short little set it went back to Techno/Dance (I think? I don't even know how to classify the music), and we jetted out of there to catch the last 12:30 tram. If the music had been more my tune I would have loved to dance on top of Vegas all night."

            "review": "MIX is one of those Vegas restaurants/clubs that you should see at least once;  After all, the views are impressive and vibe, ultra-lux.   But as often is the case in this town, the place is more about style than substance.  And there's certainly lots of style to go around here.\n\nLocated on the top floor of THEhotel (a smallish boutique hotel in the Mandalay Bay superstructure), MIX can be a little difficult to locate. I was actually staying at THEhotel the first time I ate here and had a hard time finding it. There are no signs or brochures promoting it, and it wasn't even mentioned in the in-room resort guide. This is intentional of course, and adds to the mystique and (artificial) sense of exclusivity.   \n\nTo further boost its guest's sense of self-importance, MIX is serviced by a single unmarked glass elevator with the usual matrix of floor buttons, the topmost of which is marked simply \"mix\" (I had used the elevator a few times earlier in the day and hadn't even noticed it).   Press that button and you're whisked to the top floor of the hotel (or should I say THEhotel) with dizzying views of the city en route.\n\nAs you step out of the elevator, you'll notice that the decor here is \u00fcber-trendy, complete with a $1M+ glass champagne bubble chandelier that dominates the room.  The style is sort of Robert Ryman meets Paris Hilton:  White walls, white tablecloths, white chairs, even white china.  White on white on white on white; If you're a neo-minimalist who can stare in awe for hours at a small white dot on a white canvas, this is your place.\n\nIn terms of cuisine, I couldn't really sense a theme here.  Modern American, perhaps?  But everything I tried was well made and artfully presented, with the ubiquitous petite portion sizes so popular in trendy Vegas eateries (I suppose that's how some of the super models in evidence here stay in their size zeros).\n\nWhile the cuisine was certainly adequate, nothing really stood out for me (other than the cool stainless steel bowls in which our salads were presented).  And that's an issue when you consider all the world class restaurants in this town. With such stiff competition, there's really little incentive for a return visit, other than the views perhaps (which are pretty awesome, I'll admit).  But then MIX is one of those places you go to be seen and to enjoy the spectacle of it all;  The food isn't really the main event.\n\nAll in all, my takeaway was a solid \"meh\".   Like much of Vegas, MIX is certainly worth a first date but isn't really long term relationship material.  However, if you're in your early 20s and want to club the night (and your trust fund) away in Paris' penthouse, MIX just might be your spot."

            "review": "-Saturday night, (8/25/12), right before the dinner rush.\n\nI had never heard of Mix restaurant until a week before I was invited to go there for dinner.  Mix is more known in Vegas as a bar/lounge with great views of the strip and is located at the top of the THEhotel, a part of the Mandalay Bay resort.  You can get up to the lounge by two elevators.  One is a great all glass elevator on the outside of the hotel that provides fantastic views of the strip and the valley beyond as the elevator whisks you to the top of the hotel.  The other is an inside elevator for those afraid of heights.   This outside elevator opens up into the very large bar area.  The bar also offers a balcony where you can sit outside and enjoy sweeping views while you drink and socialize.  You can walk through the bar into the adjoining restaurant.  The restaurant is a circular room done in white and chrome colors with contrasting bright red glassware and windows almost all the way around.  There are strings of clear glass balls hanging down from the ceiling that help to separate the space from the bar.  I suppose it is meant to look sophisticated but it instead it just looks dated, like a set from an old Austin Powers movie.\n\nWe started off with an appetizer of the chicken and coconut Thai soup ($16) and a half order of seared duck foie gras ($17/Full order is $32).  The soup had similar ingredients to the traditional Thai Tom Ka however it was watered down and bland.  It tasted as if an amateur chef was trying to replicate a Thai dish and failed.  The foie gras, on the other hand, was luscious and fatty with just a smattering of lemon confit on the top to balance the tastes.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the John Dory \"Meuniere\" ($38) and the Slightly Glazed \"NE3\" Pork Belly with spicy \"mangavocao\" salad ($34).  The fish was slightly overcooked and somewhat dry but served with enough fennel and tomatoes to cover the mistake.  The pork, on the other hand, was cooked well but very, very salty.  The mango and avocado salad tasted fine and was artfully presented in a small lettuce leaf, but did not go well with the salty pork meat.  I like fusion cuisine but this tasted more like throwing flavors together simply for the sake of it, rather than for the taste.  Perhaps they should stop trying to think up cute phrases to put in quotation marks on their menu, and concentrate more on cooking well.  We would not order either of these dishes again.\n\nFor dessert, we both had the home made ice-cream and sorbet.  You can create your own plate by picking any combination of four ice creams flavors, sorbets or toppings from an extended list of choices ($9).  I had the pistachio and almond ice creams with maraschino cherries and brownie bites toppings.  Your \"creation\" is served simply as two small (and I mean small) ice-cream scoops on a plate with two little cups on the side filled with your choice of toppings.  While the ice cream tasted fine, the maraschino cherries were straight out of a jar from the supermarket and the brownie crumbles were a tad stale.  You could get something tastier and cheaper at your local frozen yogurt store.  This is from a Michelin star chef?\n\nThe service was good and the waiter was attentive but there were several times when we had to ask for water.  To quote the waiter's own words, \"it is a bad idea for a restaurant to use red glassware; you can never tell when the glasses are empty\".  If only the restaurant management would note the same point.  Overall, the food was just ok.  But you expect more from a Michelin star chef.  Perhaps the executive chef is not replicating Chef Ducasse's dishes correctly, perhaps the restaurant is just a second thought to the bar or perhaps they are just hoping that you are so tipsy from the bar that you don't notice the imperfections in the food.  In any event, I would definitely recommend bringing your guests to the lounge to enjoy the view and drinks, but then bring them elsewhere to eat."

The texture is so important when I pick sea food since you can overcook them just in seconds. My lobster was so tender and tasty while not overpowered by the curry sauce around. Not easy at all! When the plate came I was like:\" wow ,it is small\", then I realize there was 4 or 5 piece of lobster meat without any shell, side veggie or so, PURE LOBSTER MEAT BITE, oh, sorry, a small portion of risotto, which adds more change of texture. I was full after the entree, I was happy like I was  in heaven!\n\nAll my co-guest were happy with their choice such as Prime Rib and Lamb chop.\n\nYay, Las Vegas will continue drawing me back since it is indeed the battlefield of sensational food, i The dinner at MIX is definitely a high-note of this trip!"

This is a great place to start your evening, no matter if you're staying at the hotel or not. The balcony offers one of the best views of Las Vegas and the food and drinks are fantastic. And with an extensive wine list it's a perfect spot to get a bottle, sit back, and relax with friends before the long night ahead! The appetizer list is perfect for just an occasion. Definitely try the Mac 'n Cheese dish and the beef skewers, which pair perfectly with any of their hundreds of red wines. While just there I had a bottle of the DeLille Cellars D2, a merlot, cab, cab franc red blend out of Washington State. It was a perfect start to the evening. They open at 5pm and I recommend getting there shortly after that because as it gets darker things start to get considerably busier."

At prices that are slightly less, I believe there are better experiences to be had - in fact, I'd pick Fleur de Lys right in the same property over Mix - however, if you want to have dinner and a spectacular view, it's hard to imagine a better place than Mix (The food here is much better than Voodoo at the Rio, and the view is better here too)."

The line wasn't even that long - probably around 30 feet long. The cover for Saturday night was $25 - that would have been fine had the place actually been fun. \n\nYou ride the elevator to the 64th floor - it's a glass elevator, so you see yourself rising and floating above the Strip. That was cool. The view is AMAZING. The place definitely has the view going for it - you see all of the strip from Luxor to Paris to Stratosphere. The place has a trendy decor, and the drinks were strong. \n\nIt must have been old people night and the DJ was playing remixed 1990s songs. The DJ sucked. All the songs were given an electronic beat. I wasn't feeling the music, and it was hard to dance. OMG the place was crawling with people in their late 30s, 40s, or even 50s. And they all CAN'T dance. I think the entire time I was there, I just stared out the window.\n\nI would not recommend this place, unless it's for the view."

For our entrees we ordered  Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin &  Roasted Chicken w/ a side of Creamed Spinach. The chicken and the creamed spinach tasted like somethin I could make at home and the Bison was alright, nothing too spectacular.\n\nThat night there was a wedding dinner reception so all of the servers' attention were focused on them (hey thats fine, you guys got married!) but please also think about the other patrons in the establishment. There were three couples around us who weve overheard complaining of the length of time to get service.\n\nWe spent close to $200 for dinner and (bein a high-maintenenace foodwhore that my husband is) money isnt an issue, but weve spent less and have spent more than $200 at other fine-dining restaurants without a view where the food was top-notch and the service was impeccable. \n\nEven if our meal was free, I would NOT eat here again.\n\nBut then again, its just my opinion.."

It was my birthday and I got all glammed up to go out on the town with the boyfriend for a magical dinner with decadent food and wonderful service.  That would not be the case on this night!\n\nIt all started with a half hour wait just to get ANYbody to stop by our table and offer us a glass of water.  Disappointed, but not ready to give up yet we ordered a bottle of wine and and appetizer, which took almost another half hour to receive.  The food was just ok, not worthy of the premium pricing.\n\nThe booths are super cute, Jetson-esk little domes (for lack of a better description.)  Random noise & conversation carries surprisingly well throughout the restaurant.  Well, just as our main courses are arriving we overhear our waiter, who couldn't possibly have been more unpleasant all night, talking smack about us because we are drinking regular water instead of paying for the premium water.\n\nI have absolutely no idea how MIX ever received Michelin stars.  We didn't interact with a single member of the service staff that I can offer a single compliment.  As soon as we finished our entrees we promptly left to find another venue for dessert.  We paid quite a bit of money to receive service levels that were just down right painful."

Their vibrant colors. Their smooth textures.\n\nPart of me longs to recommend dishes, but Mix is too exciting. You need to explore the menu on your own.  Listen to the waiters' share their own personal favorites. \n\nAfter  - head on over to Mix Lounge.\n\nAnd on the way back.\n\nPose for pictures on Mix's stairwell, as you tug down your Pretty Woman polyster pre-makeover bright green dress (for men: a beige linen slightly wrinkled suit), lips rolling up to expose a big Vegas smile, still sticky with the fresh fruity taste of a passion fruit foam cocktail that touched your soul enough to put on Wendy Rene."

The lounge is very cool especially the outdoor section that looks over the strip and there are plenty of booths facing outward to admire the view as well as these strange little cement booth things with cement table between two. \n\nMy husband and I sat in the aforementioned \"booth\" and found that while they were comfortable, you are siting so far away from your companion that you have to practically yell to talk. We ended up sharing a single side and found it much more enjoyable. \n\nI had a glass of cava which had both bubbles and booze, so I was happy. My husband had a pomegranate manhattan which was surprisingly good. Not too sweet and very well balanced, so he was happy. \n\nWe also participated in the nightly toast which could have been cool but the \"champagne\" was warm and flat. IMO, if you are going to offer something to your guests, it shouldn't suck. I would rather not have had it at all. \n\nAfter our single round of drinks, we left as the crowd was older and once you saw the lights and took some pics, there wasn't a whole lot left to do. Overall, I would suggest riding the elevator up, taking some pictures when you walk in and leaving to have drinks somewhere else."

First the room is amazing. It's all white with a gorgeous (and huge) chandelier with glass bubbles floating in the air. There were also cool pods for couples to sit in. We however got a seat along the windows which gave us one of the best views of Vegas 64 stories up. Our server Lee was great. He explained a few things to us and was there when we needed him but wasn't in our face about anything and didn't act weird or treat us differently when we gave him a $50 restaurant.com gift certificate. For dinner we were given compliments of the chef a chilled corn soup. Sounded weird and kinda gross but it was really, really good. For dinner we both had the free range chicken with vegetables and potatoes. The chicken was AMAZING. Perfectly cooked in a chicken reduction. My husband doesn't eat dark meat normally but it was all gone off of both of our plates. We then were given (at no charge) a two free desert martinis which were heaven in a cup. The wine steward was excellent and we did have two very good glasses of wine. We then ordered for dessert the desert tray which consisted of five pieces of heaven. There was a flan, a chocolate desert and a few other things which I can't remember right now but god was it amazing. We also were given two warm cookies with nutella which were wonderful. Once we told the manager how much we loved it, he gave us two glasses of champagne on the house and invited us to the lounge which was beautiful. So amazing overall and I can't wait to return on my next trip to Vegas."

So my husband and I were very excited to finally get the chance to go. \n\nWhen you come up to the elevators the reservationists asks your name, points you to an elevator, you get out of the elevator with no clue as to where to go. You walk accross the lounge looking for anyone to help you. When you get to the restaurant they look at you and ask you for your name again, now why would you not communicate that from downstairs? We were able to find the restaurant quickly, but had it been busy inside I would have no idea where to go. \n\nThe interior design of the restaurant and bathrooms is simply stunning and I was so excited for the meal to begin. We were brought the bread which had peanut butter and butter as a spread, cool idea, but not well executed. The peanut butter had just come out of the refridgerater as well as the butter and was not spreadable. I tried, but it just ripped the bread in half. \n\nThe sommelier came over asked if we needed wine suggestions and I had told him that I was looking at a riesling, by the glass and wanted to know if it was sweet or dry. He said sweet and recommended something a little drier... so I picked the wine he suggested and out came a sickly sweet riesling. Weird to have a riesling this sweet by the glass, it reminded me of Ethos Late Harvest as a dessert wine. I suffered through it and never ended up finishing it. \n\nThe food was underseasoned and the foie gras for my first course was WAY to sweet.. foie is so delicate, why would you over power it with so much sugary jam? My fish was overcooked and nothing wowed me. I was so disappointed in the food as this is Ducasse's place and how could I forget when our waiter was mentioning that it was \"Sir Ducasse's\" restaurant every five minutes. I get that you are proud, but you're just hurting his culinary reputation by touting it repeatidly. \n\nService was good, although I had an entire mushroom side vessel spilled on the table and dripping into my lap. I'm sure the manager saw this as he was staring at our table all night, but never came over to appologize. \n\nNot a true representation of Michelin stars... I'm not sure why they even came to Vegas because compared to Europe the restaurants here are not deserving of Michelin. \n\nThe one positive note is the view-- so come up for a drink instead of eating and the dessert BabaRum was amazing!"

We decided it would be a nice way to burn some winnings and celebrate our time in Vegas. I'm not really up on Vegas culture or where to go on the strip so I don't know if this place is very well-known (Besides the restaurant anyway) but it's a must-do in my opinion. \n\nIt's a little hard to find depending on where you come in- it's just past the Michael Jackson Cirque theater. You get on a glass elevator and go to the 64th floor. It opens at 5:00, and if you want to sit in the lounge, make sure you do so before 9:00 or so; at 10:00 it becomes a club with a cover charge, and after 9:15 they start setting up and it gets a little loud. The drink menu ranges from $12-18, with most drinks $12-14. Steep but for where you are not really that bad. I ordered the grapefruit rosemary mojito and unfortunately it wasn't well made; the rosemary was not muddled in the bottom of the glass, so it just floated around, got in the way, and didn't impart much flavor. The other drinks in our party were much better. \n\nService was fine but not much more than adequate. It was windy during the day when we came up so unfortunately the patio was closed, which was really a shame. Although the view is amazing from all angles, you can't get good pictures inside because of all the glass and glare. Make sure before you leave that you go to the bathroom here! The men's has the urinals on a glass wall facing out, and one of the women's stalls has the toilet facing out a floor-to-ceiling window. It was a fun surprise on our way out of the lounge. If you want to get a really good \"Vegas vibe\" or impress someone for a quick drink, come here. It'd be a good place for a first or last stop on a date as well."

Nothing mind blowing but perfectly prepared and seasoned apps and entrees. Both the Lobster and Crab salad apps are musts. Entr\u00e9e was the Filet topped with a seared Foie Gras steak. It was excellent\n\nI do think the food is slightly overpriced. You're basically paying for the view and I suppose in many ways, that part is priceless. Definitely a must visit if you haven't already"

I was even ready to pay cover since that's what I read on the website ($10 for theHotel guests), but they ended up not charging us anything. I guess it wasn't extremely busy and they were just looking for more people. Not really sure how much the drinks were, but probably typical Vegas prices. Also didn't try out any of the food they might have. At the time we went, there was loud music playing and most people dancing, but not like an all out club. Not sure what it's like at other times, but if you're coming here you're definitely coming for the view and chill vibe."

The food and drinks are priced for Vegas, but are worth it. I would recommend the duck spring rolls and mojitos. All of the appetizer menu items are pretty tasty and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is very classy and chic. Check out the bathrooms! They are some of the coolest bathrooms I have ever seen! The service is wonderful--friendly smiling staff. I felt like we got our money's worth each time. Did I mention the view? Amazing. This is a must see place!"

The reservations were made for 10pm, however we were late and called Mix to let them know. We arrived at Mix at 1030pm and were not seated right away. I mean we stood around for a good 5 to 10 mins. This wouldn't be a problem, but there wasn't that many people there. \n\nWe finally got seated and our waiter brought us water. As we were looking through the menu, he kept coming over to our table and telling us to hurry up and order. Need i remind you that we just sat down! He must of told us to hurry up 3 times before we ordered. I ordered the Scallops, free range chicken breast and some kind of truffle soup. I must say the food was good though. Despite the irritating service the food was well prepared and had tons a flavor. However, I cant justify three small scallops for $50. \n\nAlso, their dessert is excellent. Their tiramisu is to DIE for. We ordered two of those. This Apple pie type thing and some ice cream. If your hungry don't come here for their entrees, but do come there for their desserts."

The view is amazing from any table and the food was pretty good as well although nothing stood out as a spectacular dish. My favorite was taking the elevator here as you get a panoramic view of vegas during the elevator ride. This is a 10 dollar cab ride from hotels on the main strip (bellagio/venetian/mirage/etc) but well worth it if you plan well. Be sure to tell them if you have a time limit because our food took forever to come out and it caused a delay in the rest of our evening.\n\nPS. Get the crab salad. It's amazing."

The place is pretty and the view is gorgeous but i found the restaurant too big and because it was only half full it felt really dead and boring. Wine list was ridiculously expensive, and my mom usually doesnt care abt price but there were only two bottles out of hundreds under $100. Appetizers came out wayyy too fast and were pretty good but not amazing, better than the main courses though. Main courses also came out far too quickly, esp since it was so empty in there. Moms veal was really odd and bland, my filet/beef tenderloin was just ok and kind of cold. Desserts were the highlight of the night and we were given a free one. Overall i would never go back for dinner, but would maybe recommend to a couple for drinks before dinner or dessert since the view is so pretty. Was only in vegas one night so this kind of soured the trip, should have gone to il Mulino."

Visit the Mix early enough and there will be ample seating, but be warned, huge crowds descend on Mix later in the evening. Also, if you love to dance, this isn't the place to come as the dance floor is very small. In addition, the bartenders don't seem terribly knowledgeable, you need to tell them how to make popular mix drinks which is ironic considering the clubs given name. A place like Mix should hire only true mixologists who are capable of blending mind numbing concoctions. The club has balcony seating but it's reserved for \"bottle service\". If you're not purchasing a bottle, they won't grant you access, regardless of whether there's seating available. But there are great views all around. I'd say come to Mix to start your evening, have a drink, lounge a bit and then move on."

I tried the Seared Duck Fois Gras with Lentils, Beef Tenderloin  with Sauce Au Poivre, and Pressed Chicken Fois Gras with leeks and truffles. The chicken was the only redeemable dish.  The food was not presented \"four star and four diamond style\". Basically, the food was mediocre except the chicken pate. Even the two desserts were boring and lackluster pastries. I've tasted way better pastries at small pastry shops like JPM at Bellagio. Please don't waste your money here. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay the $200 - $300 check. For the price this restaurant is a definate don't. The view by the window was cool though and the decor was superb. Le Cirque is a better choice if you want to experience French American.

The sauce was light and nothing spectacular, albeit the scallops were seared perfectly. The seating was a bit awkward, as we were seated and a round table at the edge of the restaurant near one of the large points of view where you can look out into the city. I sat in a position where I was directly facing a couple who were seated directly facing me. No sir, I am not checking you out...you just happen to be where the view is. \n\nThe reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3? The boyfriend ordered from the  Christmas menu, in which he chose a raw & cooked vegetable tart as an appetizer, beef filet mignon as an entree, and Christmas log as the dessert for $95. The appetizer was very rich in truffle sauce. The entree, which was the star of the meal, consisted of shiitake gratin, pommes Anna, and bordelaise sauce. The shiitake gratin was spectacular! I could eat them nonstop. The filet mignon was also cooked to perfection, not too chewy. The Christmas log was a standard small roll cake. I had the roasted pineapple dessert, which was a pineapple cake on the bottom, with roasted sliced pineapples on top, pineapple chips and sauce. It was delicious. At the end of the meal, one of the chefs walked by and offered freshly baked madeleines. Best madeleine I've ever had in my life.  Also, service was very attentive and courteous. :)\n\nI would consider coming back for a prix fixe menu, but only if I got a table with the view of the city. The view from the side of the restaurant outside is lovely as well (although too cold for winter, brr).\n\nOne last thing, as beautiful as the view in the bathroom is, the stalls were not up to par for an upscale restaurant. The white paint looked like it was coming off and there were no designs anywhere to be seen. It didn't seem elegant at all (after you see the view and walk to a stall, you'll see what I mean). There were also only three stalls. (I'm picky with bathrooms)."

I liked the appetizers we ordered (blue fin tuna tartare and Vitello Tonnato) more than the main dishes (Duck Breast and Pan Seared John Dory.

This time, however, was a different story.\n\nThe restaurant/lounge itself is absolutely beautiful. I have heard that the restaurant is supposed to represent heaven, while the lounge represents hell..and I totally get that.\n\nAnyways...the boy had made reservations a while before for a Friday night. I didn't know, however, that he was going to propose here....because he actually proposed as soon as we got to Vegas in our suite since he couldn't wait. Long story short, he proposed a second time when we went to Mix and had a whole sneaky plan worked out with the manager and sommeilier. \n\nWe took the guest elevator up, since we were staying at Thehotel. The hostess was very gracious and seated us right away--outside which was awesome--the view is amazing, although in August, a little hot. Our waitress was amazing...very personable, able to recommend dishes and just fantastic all around. We started off with the potato gnocchi, which was fantastic--very light, but flavorful. We also had another appetizer, but I can not remember exactly what--other than that it was some kind of beef and melted in our mouths.\n\nThe bread with the homemade peanut \"butter\" was awesome--very yummy. For my entree, I had the lobster curry--lots of lobster, VERY flavorful sauce and a generous portion. The boy had one of the specials of the night which was filet, with foi gras(which was VERY tasty) and some kind of sauce. He definitely enjoyed it. We also split the side of the elbow pasta, black truffle, ham, gruy\u00e8re cheese ie...Mac and Cheese. It was so yummy, the truffles and cheese just blended into this amazing flavor--I kind of have this obssession with mac and cheese..if it's on the menu, it must be ordered.\n\nOur waitress was constantly checking on us, but not in the annoying intrusive kind of way...just the right amount of checkin up. After dinner....a bottle of VERY nice champange came out and the boy proposed again....and we were given a congratulatory desert compliments of the chef, amidst my tears. A Mix Candy bar....YUM. I can't even describe it other than it was delicious. The sorbet that complimented it was so good too. We finished off with the madelines and nutella, which was really a nice touch.\n\nIt was an amazing night, one I will never forget. We also had an awesome couple sitting next to us that had just gotten married...and we ended up going out and hitting up the clubs with them. A newly engaged couple and a bride in her wedding dress....we had an awesome night!\n\nTry Mix! You won't be disappointed!!!"

She sent us to the bar and fetched us after a short wait. The mojitos at the bar were awesome. The bartenders were friendly and went to to the trouble of going to the kitchen to search for mint. Bread basket was okay, the peanut butter spread was interesting but not fabulous. Our party of three had the spicy crab salad, filet mignon and farmers market vegetable cookpot. All were delicious. They were accommodating with the request to make the mac and cheese without ham. Our waiter was attentive and service was excellent. He brought us profiteroles warm from the pan with chocolate, on the house. Can't wait to go back."

We went last Friday since we were staying in Mandalay and thought we'd give it a try.  \n\nI know Vegas is all about the velvet rope, but we went when half the lounge was cordoned off for a \"private party\" while the other half was blocked-off for the bottle service tables.  I assume it's like this every night.  \n\nNow I'm okay with the idea of bottle service, but why make a lounge all blocked off like that - kind of inhibits \"MIXing.\"  And it never feels good to have goons in the middle of the place gaurding entry/exit points like you are in Soviet Russia.\n\nI went to Risque in The Paris a couple years back and had the table service, I've done that a couple times, but it isn't like that at Mix .  At Risque, tables are reserved, that's all.  You can freely walk around or chit-chat with whomever you please.  It's cooler.  Mix's setup leaves very little real estate to walk around in.  \n\nThe balcony was totally closed too, even though it wasn't that cold and didn't seem very windy, plus they did have heat lamps.\n\nThe crowd was also lame, mostly older guys, like old, like 50s.  I'm over 30 and I still felt like I was partying with papa.  I was there with another dude and a good looking girl, and they got each of us for a $20 cover.  Even the blond girl?  Duh, bad business, morons.  With the crowd I saw at the pool in Mandalay earlier, it shouldn't have been that bad, but it was.\n\nAnd the music was just junk, you couldn't dance to it.  The DJ apparently didn't notice he had an empty floor all night, or didn't try different stuff to get people up.  Or it just wasn't working with the people they let in.\n\nAnother threesome that sat at a nonreserved table for a couple hours like us gave up and left at the same time.  We agreed:  Mix = bad wedding + cash bar.   \n\nI will give them one credit: the bartenders were very friendly.  That's about it, though."

I am willing to pay any amount of money for DAMN GOOD FOOD. \n\nPrior to my dining experience at MIX, I'd been there quite a few times for drinks, dancing. THAT is fun. Dance the night away while enjoying a perfect view of the Las Vegas Strip. That experiences were worth 4 stars. \n\nHowever, my dining experience could hardly compare.\n\nFirst, when we arrive, all of the windows are closed and there is no view of the strip. (The MAIN reason we came to MIIx was for the view.) **noted, the view was visible from the bar area, but not the dining area\n\nSecond, the food quality at MIX is hardly worth the amount of money it costs.\n\nThe vegetable plate that the server recommended to me consisted of squash & carrots that tasted off-beat, as though it came straight from the aisle of the frozen food section. \n\nThe $32 Cod looked like a meal that would be served in a Conference Center at some hotel.... maybe off a buffet. Plus, it was bland.\n\nI noticed two women sitting at a table next to us and both of them had their purses on the floor. I'll be damned if I'm paying 75$/person for a meal and I have to sit my belongings ON THE FLOOR!\n\nThere are many dining options in Vegas, I would NEVER choose the MIX again. In fact, I've found plenty of restaurant/bars that offer a beautiful view in Vegas, I may never even visit MIX again to experience that view....\n\n(You want a fancy place with an amazing view, visit the bar at The Mandarin Oriental)"

And 5 minutes is longer than you think when you just spent 90 minutes at the MJ One show and you're ready to eat off your hand with hunger. So we left. And came here. A bit different, to put it mildly. Service was impeccable, but not snooty. The Missus and I both got different tasting menus. Mine was the Alain Ducasse 4 course one sans wine. From the cold broccoli soup amuse to the amazing lobster curry to the foie gras topped filet to the Armagnac dessert, almost everything was very well presented and tasted amazing. First time with foie gras. Would definitely have been beyond the pale if served solo, but topping the perfectly cooked medium rare filet balanced it's richness. All I know is the junk was tasty. The only misstep was the mashed potatoes that accompanied  the filet. They were served in a bowl separate from the plate, and surprisingly...basic.  \n\nAtmosphere was romantic, view was stunning, of course, and definitely an experience to remember. Not cheap. But actually worth it."

My friend works here and she said she has gotten stuck on the elevator before. And all you can do is wait until it starts working again. That's kinda scary especially when you're so high up and can see how high up you Are.\n\nThere's the restaurant and then there's the lounge. We decided to just hang out in the lounge. The restaurant has an angelic white theme where as the lounge is more dark and mysterious. Both have a section to be seated outside on the balcony. That is the ONLY way to be seated. You have to seat outside it has the most amazing view of the Vegas strip. Amazing! Romantic! \n\nFor foods:\nBig Eye Tuna TarTar-- amazing! it has such a refreshing taste. The chips were pretty flimsy and break easily so make sure you use a fork to put it on the chip instead of using the chip to pick up the tuna tartar. \n\nMix N Roll-- I could eat that all day! It is a lobster roll sandwich with the most amazing burst of flavors. The bread is not too soft so it doesn't move around a lot. It comes with fries too. MUST GET. Amazing!\n\nCheeseburger sliders-- these were very tiny cheeseburgers. Also comes with fries. Nothing really special about them but none the less still good. \n\nMini short rib tacos-- I actually wasn't too found of the tacos but everyone seemed to like them.\n\nFor drinks of course I got myself a Moscow Mule, amazing as always. \n\nThe foods at the lounge are like Tapas, very small plates so if you come with an appetite I suggest the restaurant OR order a lot of plates at the lounge. BUT, we ordered for 4 people and we left very satisfied. Amazing place, will return to eat at the restaurant."

All the staff were smiling, no one walked by without checking my table to see if I needed anything or to remove a dirty dish or pick up and empty Sweet 'n Low packet.  My server was Haydee, and she was marvelous!\n\nI got the Ducasse Classics, the grand tasting menu.  Before ordering, I asked the area manager for my section of the restaurant--who took my order--if I could switch dessert because I didn't want to have the Baba Au Rhum with the small bottles of rum and cream alternately poured on the cake.  He had me look at their \u00e0 la carte menu and pick any dessert from that--even the souffl\u00e9 and he would substitute.  That's customer service and it's very accommodating. \n\nBread basket:  Standard types of bread.  One in particular had red bell pepper baked in it.  That was great!  There was regular butter in a small holder with two sides.  On the other side was a peanut butter spread.  It was excellent when you let it come to room temperature.  Heavenly flavors.\n\nThe courses:\n\nAmuse bouche:  Mango and shrimp coulis with sliced daikon and sliced red radish.  Very light and tasty.\n\nAppetizer:  Potato gnocchi with two varieties of mushrooms, sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano with veal jus.  There were a couple of baby escarole pieces that just set off the presentation of the items.  The gnocchi were absolutely the softest gnocchi I have had!  Superb!\n\nFish:  Roasted Maine lobster \"au curry\" on bed of coconut basmati rice.  There was not much curry flavor at all which would please some because there was certainly no flavor to overwhelm the delicate and sweet lobster. I tasted no coconut flavor in the basmati rice.     One small glitch here--there was a piece of lobster shell I bit into.  Now, if I were Scott Conant on \"Chopped\" I would have made that deep frown and made some remark about good chefs being careful about what they serve.  It happens and was no big deal.\n\nMeat:  Filet mignon Rossini.  A perfectly cooked filet--rare just as I asked with a large piece of delicate foie gras and several slices of black truffle.  It's the first truffle I ever had.  Before, someone merely waved some truffle above the food and said, \"OK, here's your xxxxxxx with black truffle oil.\"  This was very tasty!\n\nPre-dessert:  A martini glass with a passion fruit base and a rum foam for a topping.  Very refreshing and an excellent palate cleanser.\n\nDessert:  miX Candy Bar.  A candy bar made with alternate layers of graham cracker and chocolate all dipped in chocolate.  There was some edible gold leaf on the candy bar.  With it was a lime coconut sorbet.  The lime was very dominating such that again I tasted no coconut.  They must use only a small amount of coconut flavoring.\n\nPost dessert, dessert:  A different server brings to your table some warm Madeleines in their mold fresh from the oven.  You remove your own Madeleines with your fingers.  You also get a small bowl of Nutella with a very small spoon to spread the heavenly hazelnut-chocolate goodness on your Madeleine.\n\nI think I'll make a return visit here when it's winter and it's darker early.  The city's lights were just coming on but it wasn't yet dark enough to fully enjoy the lights of this great city!"

This review is for the restaurant, however...\n\nAfter hearing many great things, my casino host booked my friend and I reservations a few weeks back. \n\nUpon arriving, we had to wait a few minutes for a booth by the window, which I specifically requested. Alas, this accommodation was made, except we were seated at one of the booths without a view. Annoying.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, we decided on the tasting menu, which sounded absolutely lovely. Our harried waiter was too busy to take our order, so another waiter said that we \"looked like we'd been waiting a while\" (we had) and asked if he could take our order. \n\nThe first few courses went by at a leisurely pace. Our waiter was basically absent for the meal. Just about every staff other member in the restaurant accommodated our requests. Have you ever had a pastry chef get you a soda refill? I hadn't either. \n\nJust before the dessert course, we asked to add an additional dessert and would gladly pay for it, since neither of us were sure we'd like the tasting menu option. A full 35 minutes later, we'd still seen no dessert. Finally our waiter showed up with the additional one we ordered (after asking about it twice) but the one from the tasting menu was still a no show.\n\nGetting the check took another bit of time and when it arrived, we were given no apologies for the lack of the dessert. Even after mentioning it, he didn't offer to get us a new one or remove the one that we did receive from the bill, since the tasting menu course didn't arrive.\n\nHere's a couple of other flaws:\n- My friend didn't get his coffee refill (which he asked for multiple times)\n- My Diet Pepsi Refill\n- Diet Pepsi. Ew.\n- The bread basket arrived at our third tasting meal course.\n- Our waiter had a rat tail\n\nOn a positive note, the food itself was pretty good."

They did talk through each course but so quickly that a couple of times I asked how that would be cooked etc. \n\nThe door to the balcony tables kept blowing open with the wind which sent our pristine starched white table cloth flapping and the servers running to close it many times! \n\nThe decor was white minimal with glass spheres suspended by wires that reminded me of jelly fish. \n\nI really enjoyed the experience and the food was first class."

The decor is cool BUT the tables for two are way too close together and there are a bunch of big tables in the middle that are not being used. \nThe drinks were awful - no creativity at all, especially for an $18 martini. \nThe food was barely edible. I ordered the white bean soup which was bland. The egg roll that accompanied it was so greasy and I couldn't taste the veggies inside. My husband's filet was undercooked. The gnocchi was mushy and tasteless. We opted out of dessert. They gave us a little freebie which was a homemade Madeline with Nutella dipping sauce. Not exciting or gourmet at all.\nWhat a disappointing meal!!!"

The other two had the Classic tasting menu and wine pairing. The atmosphere is classy and looks beautiful at night. \n\nI don't remember the whole meal, but here are the things I do remember...\nThe amuse bouches were great. The first course was a salad which was just alright. The next dish had foie gras and apricot which was amazing. The entree I remember being good...I think it was lamb. The dessert was a \"candy bar\" which was rich and chocolately..but a little to heavy for my liking. Each glass of wine was very well paired with each course.\n\nThe mood of our meal changed drastically when I found a piece of thin GLASS in my wine. Yup...a piece of glass about the size of a half dollar. Luckily, it stuck to the side of my wine glass so I didn't get to my mouth. Also, the manager came over and apologized took off the cost of 2 wine pairings. They handled it well, but something like that should have never happened. Who knows what could've happened if I swallowed that piece of glass."

Upon arrival, we began our ascent up 64 floors to the lounge atop Mandalay Bay where we were presented with a [somewhat] spectacular view of the strip. I say somewhat because you can only see half, with all that construction blocking the stuff further down.\n\nI expected more people, being Halloween and all, but maybe they all decided to go clubbing instead. Anyway, I enjoyed the views and the music, despite cramming 5 at a table big enough for 3-4. Even the views in the bathroom were spectacular.

As soon as we walked in we came across a snotty hostess thinking that we couldn't afford the place and from there the workers were horrible. Service matters even if the food is great. Our experience here after spending 500 dollars was horrible. I had excellent service at craft steak at MGM and better food. Our waiter was great at MGM making jokes with us and talking with us. Mix, you guys have to step up your service even though the food is great. Don't get me wrong, the ambience is awesome but the service put our experience down. If your young, I don't think you'll get great service. But why should that matter!?!?!?"

This is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and I recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of Vegas."

            "review": "This is a review for the restaurant, which I just walked out of 15 minutes ago. :)  My party and I chose to go for their better tasting menu which included four courses plus an amuse bouche and pre-dessert dish.  Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Amuse Bouche: Thai Coconut Chicken Soup aka Tom Ka Gai.  A nice touch, but I've had better Tom Ka Gai at my local thai restaurant.  Too much lemongrass, and not enough sweetness.  Not bad, but not great.\n\n2. First Course: Gnocchi with Asparagus and Morels in a Cream Sauce.  I personally liked this dish, I felt that the delicate flavors were well balanced and a perfect introduction for what was to come.  My sister felt that this dish was a little on the bland side, but then again, she has a cold, so I'm not sure if her taste buds are fully functioning, lol.\n\n3. Second Course: Roasted Maine Lobster \"Au Curry\" with Coconut Basmati Rice.  I was a little apprehensive when I saw \"curry\" and \"lobster\" in the same sentence, but this was actually a very unique and pleasant twist on how I normally experience lobster.  When dining at Gary Danko in San Francisco, my go-to dish is the Butter-Poached Maine Lobster with Risotto, and here we have a similar dish with an Indian touch...delicious!\n\n4. Third Course: Filet Mignon Rossini with Foie Gras and Black Truffle.  I do love my Tournedos Rossini and MIX does it beautifully here.  My velvety filet practically melted in my mouth and the foie gras was richer than butter.  The chef was also very generous with the black truffle slices.  Definitely the star of tonight's meal!\n\n5. Pre-Dessert: Mango Puree with Coconut Foam.  This light and airy precursor to dessert looked like a fancy cocktail served in a martini glass.  Exotic, fruity, and a refreshing palate cleanser after such a rich main dish!\n\n6. Fourth Course/Dessert: Baba A L'Armagnac (Monte Carlo Style).  This was an Irish sponge cake drizzled with Armagnac and served alongside an airy vanilla bean whipped cream.  Decadent without being over-the-top, but I was still so stuffed that I could only finish half...what a waste!  Still, being a chocolate lover, I would have chosen a mousse or lava cake a la mode over this any day.  Sorry MIX!\n\nI also had two glasses of the sparkling rose and an Irish coffee to accompany my meal.  The rose was nice, but the Irish coffee had such a kick that I could only finish half for fear of being unable to walk out of the restaurant!\n\nThe location, view, and decor was AMAZING!  I'm sure you've all seen photos of the \"floating\" glass bubbles that adorn the center of the restaurant.  The floor is also made to emulate a lace pattern.  Service was friendly, but unfortunately on the slow side.  It took them over 2.5 hours to serve us four courses.  Also, I felt like the price was a little on the high side for only four courses...I've eaten at comparable restaurants here in Vegas and in SF which cost about the same for 6-9 courses.  Nonetheless, I would still consider this a very good experience and is worth trying once.  But if you're going to do it, do it all the way and go with the higher tasting menu for the best the chef has to offer!"

Here is why it's a 4 over 3 for both parts- \n\nService- good...definitely friendly. Our server and I chatted about both being from Fremont and he was a super nice guy. He seemed genuinely happy to be there as well. He comped us our cocktails I think since we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing. He asked us if we'd be there a few nights and we said we would be and offered us complimentary cocktail vouchers for another one of Mandalay Bay's fine dining restaurants. I used a Restaurant.com certificate, which my boyfriend absolutely hates, but it was for $50. I felt kind of like an a-hole for asking to use it after getting $30 worth of cocktails comped, but our server was super nice and gracious about it so we gave him a little extra for tip. \n\nThe food is great and the view is fabulous sitting at the window, but the high ceilings and strange (but cool) design make the place echo like a school cafeteria. It was hard to get a romantic feel with that. It's beautiful inside and the restaurant and lounge sections are separated enough. \n\n\nThe wine pairing was great because we were able to try some really interesting varietals with our courses. Also...the homemade peanut butter they serve with the great selection of bread was SO yummy! \n\nThe lounge has a great outdoor area where you'll get some amazing pictures and a GREAT view of the strip at night. The crowd, however...a little funky. If you've been to the Holy Cow in SF...that's what it reminded me of. Great people watching and strange Europeans dancing like they are having a seizure.... but definitely funky. It could have had something to do with the Blogger convention going on that weekend.... \n\n\nIt's not Gary Danko (which has become my litmus test for fine dining) but worth the experience I would say."

The restaurant was elegant and decorated in all white, surrounded by a massive cascading glass bubble chandelier. The starkness of the restaurant's decor provided the perfect stage for the real stars of the establishment - the food.\n\nWe ordered a couple of bottles of wine as apertifs and shared a full portion of foie gras to start. For our entrees, hubs and I both ordered the Wagyu beef and shared sides of creamed spinach and mac and cheese. While the mac and cheese was just ok, the Wagyu was spectacularly delicious and tender.\n\nDinner for 6 came to about $700. Everyone raved about their meals!\n\nAfterwards we headed next door to the Mix lounge for some dancing and libations, which has the most amazing views of the strip."

We were seated in terrible seats when the restaurant was empty (it was 6 PM).  We were able to change seats to get a better view with a better table.  \n\nOnce we were finally situated we ordered our food from a very staid boring waiter.  So far not impressed.  Soon we noticed time marching on and no sight of our food.  Suddenly we had a new waiter and a free appetizer a fantastic gnocchi with pumpkin.  The new waiter was attentive, fun and very informative.  The food finally came and it was FANTASTIC!!! I had the slow roasted pork loin and belly with grits.  My wife had the baramundi with an olive tapenade. Both great dishes, with a wonderful side of asparagus and the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted.    The new server was like a relief pitcher in baseball.  The restaurant noticed we were not happy and fixed the problem.  This attention to our personal experience with   fantastic food saved the day.  Hope to go back!"

Yeah right, if there's no tasting menu, then post it on the website so we would not have gone! The food is just so so; the foie gras was a bit tough, the mac and cheese was a huge disappointment and the filet was tasteless. The best thing is the view. For really good food, try Aureole instead. Been there three times and never been disappointed."

            "review": "I had two amazing dinners here on a recent trip to Vegas. I had to go twice because the first time was so wonderful, I had to see if it wasn't just a fluke. \n\nFirst off - if you get a waiter named Randy, you are set! He is so attentive and friendly (without being invasive). \n\nThe ambiance of the entire room is like you're floating on a cloud - the glass bubbles that surround the central seating creates a fun vibe. We wondered why many of the tables near the window in the restaurant don't have the best view of the strip. We figured it was for two reasons: (1) So the Mix Nightclub and Balcony dining could have the amazing view; (2) So the diners would focus inward on the clean and bright decor. \n\nAfter reviewing the menu, Randy gave us his suggestions for dinner. Definitely get the Shrimp Cocktail with the spicy sauce to start. The horseradish isn't overwhelming since it's tempered by the tomato sauce. \n\nWe also tried the Steak Rossini - one of Chef Ducasse's specialties. For my taste, it was a little heavy for me, but still very flavorful and tender. \n\nThe Pepper-Crusted Buffalo is another great choice if you're looking for a leaner cut of beef. \n\nThe star of the menu (in my opinion) is the Cod Brandade with lemon, capers, brown butter, and fried parsley. AMAZING doesn't begin to describe how velvety smooth this fish is prepared. It simply melts into your mouth and you wish that the dish will never end! \n\nIf it's summer, try the asparagus as a side - they shave down the sides of the stalk, relieving some of that woody texture to it. Steamed, then finished in olive oil and butter, it'll make you want to finish all your vegetables. \n\nNo dinner is complete without dessert....but what does MIX do? They bring you a complementary lemon cookie (WARM) from the pastry kitchen to be eaten with nutella. Wow!! But, don't you dare stop there! Be sure you have the Mix Candy Bar (and ask for another scoop of caramel ice cream to be served with it). Simply the perfect finish. \n\nI'd happily go back here again and hope you have the same experience as I did. Cheers!"

We had restaurant.com certificates from here and Aureole, so I decided to give Mix a try, since my impression of Aureole that part of the experience of going there is to buy their really expensive wine to watch the wine angels grab it for you.  I didn't want to spend that much so Mix seemed like a better choice.\n\nI know this is a Michelin star restaurant, but I wish I could have felt satisfied with just an entree at this place.  While some of the food was some of the best I have ever had, I just question the point of charging so much for so little, especially in a town hard-hit by a recession.  \n\nThose of you that are a fan of this type of upscale food don't hate me, I want to be a foodie so bad but I just don't want to sell my house to pay for it.  I am an unemployed student, after all!  And good quality food should be accessible to everyone, not those who can afford to pay the premium prices."

Since I've basically declared the Mandalay Bay my second home (not by choice btw), I've come to know and love the fact that restaurant.com offers discounts to almost all of their restaurants.  It allows business people without an expense account, like myself, the opportunity to eat good food without feeling the urge to jump off the beautiful balcony when the check arrives.  So thanks restaurant.com!\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is stunning.  Definitely worth the trip just to see it.  I would have been happy dining inside but we were escorted to a table outside so that we could enjoy the beautiful view.  Nice!\n\nAfter deciding against a cocktail...\n\n***sorry, I have to add a side note here.  Mix, update your cocktail menu!  The cocktails on the list are reminiscent of Sex and the City circa 1994!***\n\nwe decided to check out the wine list.  If you're not dining at Mix for a special occasion, you can get away with a $50 bottle.  It won't be great, but hey, when you've been working for 12 hours, who cares.  We settled on an unmemorable bottle of white.  \n\nWe started with the 1/2 portion of foie gras.  It was gigantic.  I kept wondering if they brought the full order because it was so big.  Definitely large enough for 2.  It was amazing.  \n\nFor the main course, I chose the braised wagyu en cocotte.  It was phenomenal.  The most tender and delicious meat that I've had since I can remember.  I don't think I even needed a knife.  I would comment on what my friend ordered but who the heck knows.  I don't think I even looked up from my meal to see.  It was that good.\n\nAt the end of the meal we were stuffed.  I don't think I was able to finish my main course but there's always room for ice cream.  We went with the homemade ice creams and sorbets - coco lime, buttermilk and butter pecan.  Worth every calorie.\n\nTo top things off, our server was cool and very professional.  He took great care of us.  It was a great way to end the work day.  I loved it!"

All of the employees that work inside Mix are very friendly and greet you the moment you take that elevator ride up to the top floor.    You just get that  V.I.P. feeling when you enter the restaurant.  \n\nYes, prices are on the high side, but this part of the 'experience.'  The $90 entrees were a bit to expensive for my taste so we opted to go with the $30-$40 dollar range to see what that would get us.      I ordered the chicken on couscous and the GF ordered the Wagyu beef stew.   Both dishes were full of flavor and satisfying.  \n\nThe bread basket with 6 different types of bread is extremely fancy.    \n\nThe $8,900 dollars per bottle of wine menu is definitely something to tell your friends about.      \n\nServers randomly approach your table and deliver you dishes with the warm message:  \"this is straight from our kitchen and is ON the house\"    Class Act, right there.  \n\nI will return someday"

First impression is that the restaurant and lounge as a whole were pretty dead, but that is probably to be expected on a Monday night at 9:30. We actually enjoyed the atmosphere since it was our anniversary--very attentive service during dinner and a romantic feel in the lounge (even though \"house\" music was blasting). The area itself is large, open and beautiful, and you cannot help but notice the spectacular views of the strip. Absolutely stunning, and worth a trip up there even for just a drink. \n\nAs for the meal, we both agree that it was one of the best we had in Vegas. My husband ordered one Chef's menu and I had the other--both with wine parings. Not a cheap ticket, but there were several shining stars in the menu. There were also a few misses (one wine was WAY too sweet for me to have more than a sip of and I could have done without the port at the end), but overall this meal was a winner. Is it worth the hefty price tag? Not on every trip to Vegas, but since it was our anniversary (and my husband had been lucky at the roulette table) it was so worth it. Will definitely return to the lounge in the future. Who could pass up a dance floor with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip?"

I've been up to the lounge many times but was unaware that if you wound your way to the back, there was a large dining room.  Well whaddyaknow... the things you learn when you're not being a pissed drunk cocknozzle and stumbling into the 61st floor elevator \"to check out the view\" for the 12th time.\n\nTHE AMBIANCE\nAnyway, despite not knowing that there are actually two entrances to this place (one from THE Hotel side for the restaurant and one from MBay for the lounge) I did manage to hunt down the maitre d' and get myself seated in a room that might otherwise be described as sterile & cold but with a 70's- porn-esque all-white d\u00e9cor and a monstrous chandelier made up off hand blown glass bubbles.  Sort of reminded me of a demure N9NE Steakhouse without all the overdone lighting... or the constant & entertaining parade of boobs walking in on high heels from Moon or Rain.   Yep, this doesn't look good.\n\nTHE SEATING\nI sat next to several Gucci & DKNY decorated couples reminding me of my single days - ah, good times.  But overhearing their conversations, it seemed unanimous however that this restaurant was not really a destination amongst those that were there.  In fact, everyone seemed to be there 'just because it was open and available' and they decided to give it go.  Again, not exactly a ringing endorsement if all 4 couples are entirely new customers with none returning.  The view was pleasant enough of course, being that the Mandalay Bay's view of the strip is unmatched and of course the cocktails were top shelf with the property being half watering hole.\n\nTHE MENU\nYum.  Menu's lookin' good.  Lobster Caesar.  Hot Chicken/Coconut Thai Soup.  Bigeye Tuna Tartare.  Seared Duck Foie Gras.  Eggplant/Zucchini/Tomato/Mozzarella Gazpacho. Shrimp Cocktail.  Spicy Crab Salad w/ Guacamole & Heart of Palm & Cilantro.  Hmm!  That last one sounds good.  Excuse me waiter... hit me up with one of those.   \n\nThe waiter proceeds to let me know they also have, along with the regular menu, a \"Rossini\" Filet that's available off-the-menu:  An 8 oz Filet Mignon topped with Seared Foie Gras and slices of truffles, served in a wine & beef reduction sauce.  GAH!  Must... have... Rossini!   I did eyeball a few other dishes on the menu such as the Roasted Maine Lobster \"Au Curry\" w/ Coconut Basmati Rice, Striped Bass w/ Roasted Fennel, Seared Scallops with Sweet Corn Fricassee & Bacon, and Prawn Crusted Halibut... but I remained firm and stuck to my guns like a mole to Cindy Crawford's face.\n\nTHE VERDICT?\nI was embarrassed that I'd been secretly bagging on the restaurant in the back of my mind.  Serves me right for pre-judging.  The salad was scrumptious, reminding me of a Peeky toe crab appetizer that I once had at \"Joe's Seafood, Steak, & Stone Crab\" at Caesar's Forums.  The bed of lump crab meat was spiced with a tomato dressing & a bit of pepper & cilantro balanced with a topping of mouthwatering coolness:  A large 'hat' of guacamole & palm heart strips.  I challenged myself not to gobble it down like Fred Flintstone.  I failed epically and horked it down.\n\nThe meal was accompanied by a variety of breads & two different types of room temperature butter - a peanut-based butter and a traditional.  One thing that was a refreshing surprise was a complimentary drink:  The chef's spin on a Pina Colada served in a martini glass featuring a heavy coconut froth atop pineapple rum.  Strong but without the alcohol taste, this is a deal-closer for any single guy.  Ladies beware.\n\nBut the steak... ooh, that steak.  That was damn good steak.  Used to a bit more char & grilling and a lot less 'sauce', this MIX preparation of a Rossini steak had a monstrous amount of foie gras to allow the diner a bit in every bite, along with just enough truffles to savor along the way.  I easily sliced the filet into thin strips and in an instant, this became one of my favorite entrees of the week.  I was so impressed that I ended up using it as a benchmark for other steaks I had during my trip including those at Del Frisco's, Fleur D' Lys, Rosemary's, & ENVY Steakhouse.\n\nThe dinner was closed with a complimentary pair of fresh-baked Madeleines with a warm nutella dip.  Pleasant.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you go to the restaurant, and you're a food snob, try not to turn your nose up too quickly.  If anything the salad and steak I had was utterly satisfying and I'd hate for MIX to have to deal with more rat bastards like myself. \n\n4-Stars."

            "review": "I had a great time at miX. I originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. My horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. They were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. My date and I were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nThis place is beautiful! The bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that I was dining under the sea. Yet I'm at the very top of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. Our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although I was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nWe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy crab salad, seared foie gras, halibut, lamb loin, and the miX candy bar. I believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. My date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into foie gras or lamb. Our server offered to switch out the lamb for the filet mignon for $10 extra. \n\nWe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. I enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. It was just right. It's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\nI was enthralled by the looks of the spicy crab salad. Very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but I had too high of expectations on the flavors. I don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. For spiciness, I might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. I was a bit disappointed there.\n\nSecond course came about with seared foie gras with lemon confit & dates. I liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. I love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. Unfortunately, I'm not too educated in foie gras, all I can tell you is if I liked it and met my expectations of it. I got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. His piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, I just prefer a softer texture.\n\nThird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. Every. Bite. Was. Amazing. My general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. This dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. The flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. I seriously don't want to finish this dish because I don't want the experience to end. \n\nFourth course was my lamb loin, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. Portions were generous, or maybe I was just very full. The spices on the lamb loin didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. I didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. Otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. The prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. Unfortunately I was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nThat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. It was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. It reminded me of Thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. The tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what I needed!\n\nAnd finally, the candy bar of miX served with coconut/lime sorbet. The looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. Yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. I liked the simplicity of it though. It tasted like a Ferrero Rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. The combination is great. The sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nOur dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. It would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. In addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. It was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. Maybe next time :)"

Definitely dress up coming up here - suits and dresses.\n\nThe cocktail lounge is pure awesomeness. We were with a wedding party - and it was just awesome! My daughter got addicted to the dance floor zone and was dancing her little heart away on the flashing colors. What better way to wear her energy out to the beat of the background music?!?!\n\nAnd for those who want require or prefer \"virgin\" drinks - I would strongly recommend the Virgin Mojito! They made one for me with mango juice, lime, mint, and club soda - DEEELICious!!! And for the tiny ones in tow - they are extreeeeemely accommodating to making beverages your little ones are sure to love! (yes not the best environment for a toddler, but like I said, we were with a wedding party - so have to give props for that factor as well).\n\nOk - now one will have to use the loo at any given point hanging out anywhere. Ummm yeah - I'm writing about it - because it was my first experience of having a full window view while sitting on the you know what!!! I was initially going to shoot for the first door - but the service cleaning lady, pointed me very kindly to the other ones with the view. And sooo, it's a bit awkward at first, but ya get over it.\n\nNow to the restaurant side - wow! Talk about night and day difference! While the lounge is very dark (black furniture, black floors, black walls floor to ceiling), the restaurant side is everything white!! Our seating area was under the staircase - and they have these awesome heavy glass blown bulbs surrounding the dining area to give a more intimate feel. There are plenty of seats outside this area for more happy diners, and even the Eggshell seats (for those intimate dinners you want with your loved one).\n\nSince we were with a group - we didn't have the big menus, but a preselected menu option. Starters: Mixed Green Salad with a Sherry Vinagrette. YUM! Very light and the dressing was a perfect amount. My daughter was loving it so much she was diving both hands into the bowl to get all her yummy salad morsels. (She ended up eating half an adult portion of the salad - and LOVED every bite of it!) Our entree choices were Seared Tuna, Marinated Free Range Chicken, or Braised Wagyu!! Hubby and I both opted for the Wagyu since neither one of us have had it before - and boy we were NOT disappointed! The meat was sooo tender you didn't even need a knife to cut through! The meat was just sliding apart! Now for the wee tot we got her her very own yummy gourmet mac 'n' cheese. Normally our daughter will share - we had to bribe her to share her mac 'n' cheese with us! And lemme tell ya - it was AWESOME!\n\nNow to the dessert - Cocunut lime sorbet, with a fancy crumble on the bottom with a homemade chocolate candy bar plated on the other side. One word: YUUUUUUMMMMYYYYY!!!! It's light and crunchy and chocolatey. What more can i say?\n\nService - impeccable. Everyone aims to please you here, and you are not disappointed.\n\nThe view is definitely more spectacular as the sun sets, and the city lights start to pop out. So do enjoy!"

It's no cover before 10pm, but on that particular night (which happened to be a fight night) the place was already packed by our 930 arrival time.  For the price and the amount of time to wait in line (0 minutes 0 seconds), this place kicks ghostbar's pretentious butt!  The view is nicer because it's right on the strip, you can actually sit down (the tables aren't all \"reserved\"), the bartenders are friendly, the music is kept at a volume high enough to hear but low enough that you don't have to shout over it, and the crowd was lively.  Too bad the patio was closed off that night, no doubt for the fight night VIPs and hangers-on.  Dunno about the restaurant, but judging from these reviews here I might have to check it out next time through.  A+++ will do business with again!"

The size of my lamb for about $80 satisfied my stomach craving about 70%, but that 30% was a void that I needed to fill later with additional food.\n\nIf you're going here on a date, it's a VERY nice place with a VERY nice view on the top floors of the Mandalay Bay. \n\nJust get ready to spend quite a bit!"

The wait staff was amazing i don't think our glasses or our plates were empty the whole time we were there. The mix mac n cheese was amazing i still crave it every now and then. My Boyfriend had the bass with artichokes three different ways. I am not big on seafood but this dish was really good. Our favorite part of the meal was the dessert. We are not big on sweets but when we saw peanut butter and banana's who could resist. three scoop of vanilla bean home made ice cream with peanut butter and banana sauce. I don't know how to describe the party that was going on in my mouth as i ate this creation. I would definitely recommend this place."

We were dining on Halloween and I emailed the restaurant to ask if it would be alright if we showed up in costume.  They indicated that would not be allowed so we arranged to get dressed up after dinner instead.  When we got there, tons of people in costume were in the restaurant.  That was disappointing. \n\nOverall, I would go back in a second."

No, but for the ridiculous amount of money and for the lack luster meal he shouldnt be putting his name on this place. This is the exact reason why amazing chefs nowadays are doing pop up restaurants and test kitchens because the format of stuffy world class dining experiences is overplayed and no longer about the food.

Situated on the 64th floor of The Hotel this sure is a hip and stylish environment.\n\nOh yeah, MiX has some cute waitresses, they disarmed you quickly with their looks and you end up tipping 50% like I've done many times just because they're beautiful. So go along the ride to the top, you won't regret checking this place out. It's Vegas at its finest with all its wonders waiting outside for your viewing pleasure as far as the eye can see.

The crab salad was very tasty and had a some spice to it. I specifically ordered the Halibut bc it said it was saffron infused, and anything and everything saffron makes me happy. Unfortunately for me the halibut was too salty. I was grabbing water wherever I could for the rest of the night. Ordering sides here is a must. Amongst all the sides we ordered creamed spinach was the tastiest :) \n\nThey also brought out mini (I think it was bacon/asparagus) soups for us \"compliments of the chef\" so that we could \"open our pallets\", nice! \n\nService: Very v-e-r-y s--l--o--w. I like it when I'm out with a significant other, it lets you enjoy your meal to the fullest, BUT we were there for a bachelorette party heading out for some dancing after wards, maybe the waiter can tune into how the vibe of each table is rather than a \"one size fits all\" service? \nAlso my halibut came out later than everyone else's bc apparently it fell apart in the kitchen right before they were coming out with it and the Chef didn't like the presentation. Sure I was hungry but I liked that the Chef cared that much, plus they brought out an additional appetizer for me to enjoy while I waited. Thoughtful/Attentive +1! \n\nSO my one and only complaint. We called during the afternoon to make reservations at Mix. It being our first choice on where to go eat we were bummed that they told us they had no room to take an 8:00pm reservation. We began calling around literally everywhere around Vegas for dinner reservations (we were there during fight weekend so it was really difficult to land any) we did finally find a place to eat but we still wanted to eat at Mix bc a friend spoke highly of it. My sister came up with a little idea that we call back and tell them that we already had reservations and that we were calling to confirm (sneaky sneaky!) At first they told us we were not within their books, but that they would be happy to put us in. COOL! so I'm thinking they're probably slammed and they somehow squeezed us in and just for that they got a plus one star from me. BUT when we got there, literally 10 tables were wide open and for the remainder of our dinner there were PLENTY of tables still open. I immediatly took back my +1 point and felt that they were shady with their reservation service. Why would the girl over the phone tell us they had no space when there was tons? Very weird and strange. I didn't like that at all. \n\nOther than that, although I would like to try eating at different places while on vacation, if I had to go back I'd be more than happy to."

The smoke gets trapped there due to the winds that wrap around high rises, so the open air lounge does not help air out the place.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy smoking cigars once in awhile, but it is not pleasant if you are not indulging and are left with the second hand smoke (sorry I am from California and probably sound like a hypocrite to most readers)."

What we got was wedding banquet food and views of other tables.\n\nWe had a reservation for 9:45pm, and our waiter had to apologize that the prix fixe wasn't available after 9:30. What he didn't say was that (we presume) the chef had gone home 15 minutes earlier, and left it to the late-night catering team to ladle-out whatever had been mass-produced earlier that day.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the tuna tartare to start with, which came with taro chips and a small dollop of mango sauce on the side. Pretty plain. She followed it up with chicken (bland), while my entree was a filet of bison. I had to scrape a thick blanket of peppercorns from the top of the meat to have any hope of tasting its real flavor, while the vegetables (for which the waiter could barely contain his excitement) could only fairly be described as 'vegetables'. Quite what he saw in them, I have no idea. My girlfriend's comment that it all seemed like 'wedding banquet food' hit the nail right on the head. If these were $14 entrees I wouldn't have felt cheated. But these were not $14 entrees.\n\nWe cut our losses and skipped dessert.\n\nThe odd cocoon we were seated in prevented any views of the strip, and, oddly, had the effect of focusing sound such that it sometimes felt like diners at tables across from us were speaking right in our ears. I guess it made a distraction from the pounding of the nightclub next door.\n\nService was perfectly fine. But to charge these kinds of prices for that kind of food is cynical and shameful. I can't imagine I'll be trying another Alain Ducasse restaurant."

You walk in and get instant visual stimulation. It's incredible. From the decor to the lights of the city all around, it really is just a place that draws you in. \n\nThere were a few thins that happened that could have been avoided and this would have been a four star experience. The first incident was being seated in a cozy little nook where conversation could be had without being so close to the next person you feel like you're sharing family secrets. That didn't last long. The hostess immediately, in a bare, empty, no one-there restaurant, seats people right next to me and my date. Hello? That is beyond rude. I mean, the tables are so close together as to be really uncomfortable. To use the bathroom I literally had to wedge myself between my table and the one next to us. Awkward. Also, the waiter, when asked for my favorite Belgian beer tried to tell me they only carried one type. I had to insist that he go ask someone because he was wrong (for the record, Chimay comes in blue, white and red). \n\nOther than those two missteps everything was okay. The service was quick and flawless. The time between waiter visits was perfect. I had to ask for water just one time and after that I couldn't take a sip without it being refilled. So, great job of picking up on that. We were also greeted by several people on our way in which I thought was a very nice touch.\n\nOnto dinner. For appetizers I had the dinner salad which was essentially a larger than average bowl of mixed greens. It was mixed with a vinaigrette of some sort that just added to the bitter taste of the overall salad. I wouldn't recommend. My date had the spicy crab salad which was delicious, but absolutely could have come from mom's kitchen. What can I say, my mom's a great cook! \n\nFor an entree I had the 12 oz. boneless ribeye. It was cooked perfectly, but was much too large for me to eat so I brought the extra home. It was delicious. It did happen to be more of a fatty cut than I was used to, excessively so. It was fine, but I prefer less fat, more beef, obviously. For sides I chose the fork crushed potatoes. They were chunky and rich, but again, they could have come from my mom's kitchen. \n\nMy date had the pepper crusted bison tenderloin and seemed to enjoy it. I dislike that much pepper anywhere near me, but it looked delicious. His side was sauteed spinach which he found delicious. \n\nFor dessert I passed, but my friend had the ice cream/toppings. You get four choices of either and he chose pistachio ice cream, salted caramel ice cream and vanilla ice cream with coconut crunch as a topping. The pistachio was creamy and rich, I loved it. I could have done without the coconut, but really it wasn't a distraction. I disliked INTENSELY the salted caramel. It tasted very bland and very unlike any salted caramel I've ever tasted. I almost think that's a taste that belongs solely in candy form. I just don't think it translates well to other things, which isn't the fault of the restaurant, I've just never found that it works on much else but candy. As for the vanilla, well, it was vanilla. \n\nAll in all the decor, charm and service were perfection. The food was so enjoyable although I didn't get the Michelin star experience, I don't think. The food really was good and the view was just beautiful. With all the restaurants in Vegas, though, I doubt I'll revisit. But, do go try it once!"

While all of us are waiting on our order, they had a great selection of complimentary bread.  Along with their variety of bread and biscuits, they had peanut butter (smashed peanuts in butter-really good) and regular butter.  Their service was impeccable- never had an empty glass of water and our waiter kept asking if everything was ok.  He knew we were in a rush to get out before a certain time so our food came out on time but...my ribeye was overcooked and the taste was meh. I felt like I could've grilled my steak way better than this. I wanted my ribeye to be medium-rare so it should be slightly bloody. On my plate, it was barely a drop of blood. Also, i'm paying $46 for just a piece of steak with one red pepper, how lonely is that?! They should've added some roasted veggies for the price people are willing to pay for. We also ordered the tuna tartar and it was less than mediocre. Their taro chips were too thin to actually eat with the tuna and the flavors just weren't there. I have no idea why this fine dining restaurant would have 4-stars rating."

If you never had foie gras, you are truly missing out. It tastes nothing like liver. It's buttery, smooth, with a hint of beef that melts in your mouth. Almost like bone marrow. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#qWfPRp-VH7u53bmJ3Pgvrg\nAlmost everything about this dish was perfect. The sear, sauce, and texture was right on. The only element of the dish I disliked was the chutney.\n\nThe mixed bread, butter, and peanut butter spread were irresistible. I couldn't help but sample each style of bread and top it with the peanut butter. We ended up ordering 3 baskets of bread and extra peanut butter. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#Mng-hX8Y9JKqZ2IH8u7l_A\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the main lobster salad and my daughter order the braised wagyu. Sorry no pics. I was busy adoring my foie gras. The salad had a gratifying amount of lobster meat and the wagyu beef texture was tender and bursting with flavor. Three thumbs up from the eaters. There was enough sauce leftover from the wagyu that I was able to soak it up with the mixed bread. I made a treat of out it. \n\nWe finished the dinner with a chocolate souffl\u00e9 coupled with pistachio ice cream. The scent of chocolate drifted to the table next to me enough to turn heads and ask what I ordered. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#-AjWEQfqJ1tUGr92HgBxDQ\nIt was warm chocolate heaven. The pistachio ice cream can be a hit or miss depending on your taste buds. \n\nMix has a spectacular view of Las Vegas. There is outside seating in the balcony but it was just too hot to even consider. The decor is light, hip, and trendy with the chandelier as the main attraction. The service was excellent. As for the wines, I didn't order any this time so I can't give a review. Like the saying goes, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. And that is where my wonderful seared foie gras will stay. I'm looking forward to my next visit."

A roof and high windows, combined with heat lamps, make this a very comfortable area on cool nights.\n\nSo why the less than super enthusiastic review? Our waitress was a pill. It was only about 5:30 on a Saturday when we arrived, so the place was pretty chill, which a private party occupying most of the staff's attention. Four of us went out to the deck after being informed by the bartender it was open for seating (there was some confusion with signs and the such). We sat out there for a while, with no one coming by, and after seeing a couple walk out with drinks from the bar, assumed we had to order them ourselves. Okay, kinda ghetto, but whatever. Well, about 5 minutes later, a waitress shows up, and informs us of the happy hour special (1/2 off a good selection of cocktails - score!). But when we told her our friends were already at the bar ordering, her face soured as she clearly thought, \"Great, no tip. Thanks, assholes.\" But dude, not our fault that it took 10 minutes to get any attention for a table of 4 in an almost empty lounge!\n\nWorse yet, the bartender did not inform our friends of the happy hour special, so they spent $60 on slightly different variations of the 1/2 off drink specials. Sweet.\n\nSo come, enjoy the view, and hope the service is better at peak hours."

I think it was the first time I was ever \"on a list\". I sure felt special, even though I didn't have the little light-up toy that indicated that you were part of the cool club, the lady said that I was \"on the list\". Woot.\n\nI was here for a private party during a conference at Mandalay Bay. The view is outstanding, even (especially?) the elevator ride up. We had an open bar and wait staff carrying trays of appetizers around, and a row of girls offering glasses of wine at the entrance. I grabbed a glass of wine but quickly abandoned it for a series of long island iced teas. We admired the view for a while, got significantly drunk, and then I capped the night off with a gin & tonic. I don't remember the elevator ride down, but I somehow made it back to my hotel room safely. The drinks were excellent and strong!\n\nThe view from the open-air balcony (not really balcony; it felt entirely enclosed because of the high glass) was, as I mentioned, utterly fantastic. Starting from the Luxor pyramid with its beam of light into the sky, all the way up to the Wynn at the top of the strip. Fantastic.\n\nHaving said all that, I don't think I'd go unless someone else was paying. I didn't look at a single menu or price up there, but I'm sure it wouldn't be worth it. If you can convince someone else to pay, though, do it!"

Personally, I just want my chair to be comfortable. But what a view we did have. Overlooking the strip from the top of \"THE hotel\" tower. We would have loved to hang out in the lounge, but the way we felt after dinner, all we wanted to go was get back to the hotel room. (More on that later)\n\nWe had the 6-course special, and admittedly it was delicious. Small, tasty portions. The service was sterile. A robot set to \"polite\" could have done the job. And that's fine; I'm guessing the staff tends to allow the view to speak for itself. There was something, though, that really put a damper on the whole meal. By the fourth course, we were both more full than we've ever been in our lives. Now, we like to eat. Sometimes even to the point of gluttony. But we've never felt like this. Full, bloated, stuffed. Those words don't even begin to describe it. It was to the point of sickness, and we had to get out of there. Except, instead of simply boxing our food up and getting us our check, the wait staff seemed to be on autopilot and insisted on continuing our meal courses. So instead of making a hasty exit (it was urgent), we had to wait around another 20 minutes to get our check.\n\nIt's entirely possible our fullness had nothing to do with the meal. But I would say it was highly unlikely...we both experienced the same thing and had to skedaddle post haste. Would I go here again? Maybe if I won big and had cash to burn. Otherwise, there are other places I would venture to try that would cost less and probably wouldn't make my stomach explode."

Nothing fancy or brilliant about it. I probably could have done something better at home. \n\nI had the tuna tartare for an appetizer. It was very good... but again... something I could have easily created in my home kitchen. When I go out I'd rather be wow'd by wondering how the chef could have prepared something so wonderful. You won't find any of that at Mix. \n\nThe service was good. We had two large tables and they serviced our needs quite well... though the meal probably took a little longer you'd expect, but they try to time everything just right.\n\nThis is pretty much how I'd summarize every meal I've eaten at Mix. Something you can easily prepare at home that tastes good but you'll pay a pretty penny for at a nicely decorated restaurant with good service. \n\nIf you've never been there... I'd highly recommend at least checking out the Lounge area. It's probably one of the top two or three places that I love having an evening cocktail at and watch the sunset.

The view, particularly from the outdoor balcony, is one of the best in town. The mod atmosphere created from the wall of bubbles in the center of the main dining area, the oversized pod dining booths, and spartan decor would lead you to believe that the meal you're about to enjoy will be both trendsetting and unforgettable. It's neither.\n\nA French restaurant with a decidedly American spin along with Latin and Asian influenced dishes, the food sounded and looked better than it tasted. The gnocchi, sitting in a savory veal jus, was more mushy than pillowy. The tuna tartare was memorable only because of the bold sweetness and acidity of the mango chutney.\n\nThe entrees we dined on were good, but underwhelming for the price. Without the benefit of the bernaise and peppercorn sauces the under seasoned filet would have been disappointing. I did enjoy the curry sauce on the roasted Main lobster \"Au Curry\" dish, but the bed of bazmati rice -- and I use the term \"rice\" loosely -- was like eating oatmeal. Not a good combo with lobster in my opinion. The claw meat was wonderful, but the tail meat was so tough I had to use my wife's steak knife to cut it.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle. Not bad, but the highlight was the rocky road ice cream it came with. The other couple we dined with ordered the apple quince and caramel -- a tatin with a caramel parfait and green apple sorbet. I was able to sneak in a few bites and thought it was a fabulous mix of sweet and tart flavors. Following dessert madeleines were brought out for the table. A nice gesture, but they were so dry that not even the nutella that came with it could save it.\n\nThe disappointment didn't end with the food. Service was too casual and lackluster for a place that has garnered a Michelin star. I don't remember our server's name, but he seemed to be more suited to renting out surfboards on some random beach than working at a \"high-end\" French place.\n\nOn a positive note, there are restaurant dot com gift certificates available to lessen the shock of receiving the bill.\n\n2.5 Stars"

We were not shy about ordering:\nChocolate dome, mango chutney, passion fruit sorbet, a bit rich for my taste, but everyone else devoured it.\nChocolate Tea Tart, beautiful presentation, perfect for dark choc lovers.\nRhubarb coconut, light and the rhubarb was a nice departure from the standard fruit selections.\n\nAt the end of the meal fresh madelines are presented to the table, we were stuffed, but all of us managed to fit the buttery morsel into our mouths.  Nutella is provided with the sweet treat.  The BEST madeline I've had in my life, slightly sweet, right out of the oven, and crisp edges.  \n\nAfter dinner we wanted to check out the famed lounge.  From the stark white of the dining room, to dark chocolates and reds, we were transported once again.  I was stunned by the creativity in the use of design and space.\n\nAs for Vegas restaurants with a view, this hip restaurant tops my list for ambiance and quality of cuisine."

We didn't come very dressed up (jeans and a nice top), so right away our waiter was cold towards us. We ordered a few drinks but they tasted like there wasn't any alcohol in it, so I asked the waiter if he could bring me a new drink because this one taste too sweet, he took the drink back without an apology and brought me a smaller glass with the drink...and charged me for TWO drinks even thought i had only taken 2 sips of my first drink. Our food was fantastic but when we went to pay for the check and handed him the dining credit he gave us a dirty look and walked away. When we got our check back he had already added on his tip, assuming we wouldn't tip him well...he gave himself a nice tip of $25 for a $150 meal. Even though the food was good, the service and snooty looks were enough to never have me come back! Also, it was hard finding this place! Had to walk around for 30 minutes to find out you have to take secret elevators to get here. No thanks! Just because I live in Vegas and can't drop $300 on a nice meal doesn't mean I deserved to be treated like that."

The best way to experience it is to go right before sunset and then watch all the lights on the strip turn on before your eyes. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because it's so ridiculously expensive!! Mixed drinks are $16 each, a beer is $8. We ordered a mixed drink, a beer, and two appetizers and the bill was about 80. Of course, you can just go up the elevator and enjoy the view from the outside seating without ordering anything.

It's a fantastic place to have a few drinks before dinner, or just in general if you aren't there to dine. Even the view from the restroom is fantastic. The main dining room is very contemporary and minimalistic. Hundreds of hand-blown glass bubbles fill the area, so it almost feels like you're sitting in a glass of champagne. But what really sets this restaurant apart is the food. From start to finish, EVERYTHING we tried was EXCEPTIONAL. The one dish that really stands out in my mind was the Fillet Mignon Rossini. Being a big fan of foie gras, chef Alain Ducasse really hit a grand slam with this dish. It was easily the best steak I've ever had. On the downside, the prices are a bit on the upper end but you certainly won't be disappointed. So if you're ever in the Las Vegas area for a special occasion, Mix should be on the top of your list for fine dining dinner spots."

I've never walked into a restaurant and been more comfortable in my life. No cold air blasting on you in the middle of your meal. This adds so much to the overall dining experience. Restaurateurs should pay more attention to this detail. \nThe food was wonderful. The view is amazing! The decor here is beautiful. There is a magnificent display of glass bubbles dangling from the ceiling and encircling the center dining area. The floor is mirrored with a white medallion design. \nTo start the meal they brought out a small serving of braised short ribs with polenta. So good! I ordered the chicken and lobster surf and turf. It was incredible. I'm usually not a chicken fan, but I knew that it'd be good here, so I went for it. I was not disappointed at all. It was actually a stuffed chicken and it was so moist and flavorful. The lobster was great, of course, too. But I was most impressed with how good the chicken was. We didn't order dessert but they brought us out piping hot madelines with a chocolate hazelnut sauce anyways. It was the perfect way to end the meal.\nAt the end of dinner we went through the restaurant and into the lounge without having to hassle a line or door guy."

Beyond the hip lounge is the restaurant.  From the lounge you walk through a corridor where you have an opportunity to view the open kitchen.  I like watching chefs work and this was a treat.  Then you step into a cream white colored paradise.  Feels like you stepped into a glass of bubble filled champagne.  \n\nWe ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu - go Three Squares!  The grilled foie gras was probably the best that I have ever had and I eat a lot of foie gras.  The foie is so much sweeter when it comes from corn fed ducks as opposed to pellet fed ducks (from Hudson Valley for example).  It shows that the chef knows how to source his ingredients.  \n\nThe rest of the dishes were delicious but I loved the cheesecake dessert.  The sweet fluffy and light mouse cheesecake was paired with a more savory sour cream sorbet which I loved!  The sorbet was such a surprise and delight that I forgot about the cheesecake.  \n\nService was impeccable.  The waiter knew his cuisine.  Overall, a wonderful dining experience."

I had my bachelorette dinner here, and had talked to the banqueting manager to arrange a private room for a party of 18. However, when we arrived, we were a little disappointed that we weren't in any kind of private section, but instead, smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. Also, instead of having all of us sit at one table, they arranged it so that we had to be divided into three tables, which was kind of a bummer and a little awkward for some of my guests. We all ordered off a set menu which came with: chilled zucchini soup with fresh ricotta and basil, either the free range chicken with wild mushrooms or the slow cooked salmon served with apple mustard, jasmine rice, and seasonal vegetables, and the Mix candy bar which was basically a chocolate wafer dessert. Sadly, the dessert was the only redeeming course of the entire meal for me as I could barely touch my soup and salmon. First of all, what is with Vegas and cold soup? I guess it's because of the scorching hot weather out there, but still, I do not need to drink cold soup when I'm inside a perfectly air-conditioned room. Then after my brother made the comment \"this soup reminds me of 2 girls 1 cup\", it was definitely game over for everyone at our table. Also, from what I heard from my friends, the chicken was a little better than the salmon, but unfortunately, I ordered the salmon and had one bite and was so turned off from the overbearing mustard sauce that was poured all over my dish... I know, this is a lot of hating for a 4-star review, but honestly, I'm sure if we weren't limited to the prix fixe menu, the food would have been a lot better because the ala carte items on their menu sound amazing. Would definitely come back to try this place again with a smaller party and hopefully the food won't disappoint me again..."

I went in with my parents, and we were blown away by the meal and the service we got.   Sebastian, the manager, was terrific.  Bianca, our server, was as good as it gets.\n\nBefore people say that we were treated well simply because of a negative review, I will say that I was actually watching the tables around us, and I have to say that everybody seemed to be getting great service!\n\nNow the food-honestly, it was like I was in a different restaurant.  We started with Shrimp cocktail.  This was served in a pretty unique way, more of a small salad with shrimp mixed into it.  At the bottom of the bowl was a horseradish custard.  The dish was outstanding.  My father got a plate of sliced meats of different type (I forgot what it's called) and he loved it.\n\nBecause I was unhappy with the Tuna I had for an app last time, we were brought out a portion to try.  Once again, it was like a different dish.  The tuna had a great spice to it, and the veggies underneath were very crisp.  THAT\"S what tuna tartare should be like!  It was great.\n\nWe also had the Gnocchi appetizer.  Once again-it was outstanding.  Terrific mushrooms, Gnocchi, and vegetables, cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It was delicious.\n\nFor mains, we got the Surf and turf (Chicken breast, with lobster), the Bison fillet, and a beef filet.  SImply put, each dish was amazing.  The Bison was so tender you could almost cut it just with a fork.  My dad got the Beef filet, and the fork mashed potatoes.  As soon as the waitress put the potatoes in front of him, I said \"Dad, that looks like a different dish than the potatoes I got last time\". And I was right, because these had seasoning, butter, and were delicious! Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nFor desert, we had vanilla bean ice cream, the cheesecake, and a \"Deconstructed apple pie\".  We loved every bite.\n\nI've come to realize that any restaurant can have a bad night.  The food and service on the second trip MORE than made up for it.  I will say, I was shocked to hear from the manager after the first visit.  The effort he put in to track me down and be sure we had a great experience was incredible-there should be more restaurant managers like Sebastian here in Vegas.\n\nNot only will I be back again (as will my parents), but we've already relayed this story to several of our friends who are going to be trying MIX.\n\nThank You!"

After a nice trip to the top of THE Hotel in a glass elevator, we were sitting in the fantastic lounge that overlooks the Strip. The view is as amazing as everyone has said, and we enjoyed two very good cocktails which we then took over to our table when we were ready to eat.\n\nThe dinning room is a beautiful white with glass, contrasting the very dark lounge. We were seated on the outdoor patio, with the strip view accompanying our meal. It was a perfect night in the LV, no heat lamps were needed and it was a phenomenal setting.\n\nOur server was extremely knowledgeable about food, and not just the food he was serving. He made great suggestions without trying to force particular dishes. Waters were regularly refilled and plates cleared in a timely manner. Great service.\n\nWe ordered a bacon, pumpkin and gnocchi appetizer. It was delicious, but I could have used a little bigger portion. Bread was tasty, especially with the house made peanut butter.\n\nFor dinner my wife ordered the scallops. She loves scallops and thought these were particularly good. I order the steak au poivre, which was heavily crusted in black peppercorns, accompanied with various veggies and cooked perfectly. Very tasty. The gruyere mac and cheese was also delicious.\n\nFor dessert were ordered the apple dish, Mix is known for its candy bar desert, but sadly I'm allergic to chocolate, so I had to settle for something else. The apple mulliere was tasty, but nothing life changing. I would say the best part of the dish was the green apple sorbet that accompanied it. \n\nOverall the atmosphere combined with some pretty tasty food ensures that I will be returning here. Two cocktails, an appetizer, a side, two entrees and dessert ended up being $177, but $50 was covered by the great deal on Restaurant.com. For $127 this was fantastic.\n\nEven if the meal is out of your price range, I would recommend trying to make it up here for a cocktail and the view. One of my favorite of many, many experiences in Las Vegas."

Even though it was freezing outside (~40 degrees), we were able to sit on the semi-open 65th floor patio by the heat lamps and feel nice and toasty.  Amazing views of the strip, the best of any other penthouse bars we visited.\n\nThe drinks were pricey but it's Vegas.  My lychee martini was quite good.  The best part was that we were able to sit in the \"reserved\" seats without ordering bottle service.  That's a big plus in my book."

Take the elevators up to the top. \n\nWe had reservations, so we got a table by the windows (a MUST).  The view is from the south strip looking north. As the hotel is on the top floor of THEHotel (Mandalay Bay) you get to see the entire Strip. Incredible. Atmosphere is modern trendy yet still manages to feel relaxed and warm. \n\nStaff:\nOUTSTANDING.  The waiter we had was very friendly yet professional. You know you are in the presence of a good staff when you don't notice your water glass being refilled. Also staff has great knowledge of the menu.\n\nFood:\nAppetizer- OK don't judge, but we got the Foie Grais. A-MA-ZING. \nMain Course- I got the Seared Tuna and I think it was the most perfectly piece of seared tuna I've ever had. And I eat it a LOT. I asked about the sauce, as I am GF, they put it on the side and checked with the chef. Points for that! Husband got the John Dory \"meuniere\", also delish. \nDessert- Per our waiters suggestion for GF desserts, we tried the Strawberry Rhubarb. Excellently cooked, a little sweet and sour...perfect light end for a great meal.\n\nTIP: All in all a fantastic meal! There is also this fantastic bar you walk through to get to the restaurant with an outdoor patio. Check it out before or after for cocktails"

Next thing I know, the same mohawk guy keeps on trying to break dance.  It's like WHAT THE HECK??!!  A song or two to break dance is OK but from what I saw, a lot of people moved off the floor and some started leaving.  Did I mention this guy was also wearing T-shirt and Tennis shoes?  C'Mon.  For a place that's inside THE HOTEL by Mandalay Bay, you would've thought that they have standards there.\n\nWhen I go to Vegas clubs, ESPECIALLY on the strip, I expect for everyone to be dressed up or casually dressed up nicely and dancing the way they should!  You would think that they set a certain ambiance with all the soft lighting, view and the service but I guess not.  I understand that you can pay off certain guys to let you go in if you're not up to the dress code but someone needed to step in and ask the guy to chill.\n\nOne good thing I liked about this lounge is that you actually have table/chairs that you can sit on and enjoy your company and it's by the DJ booth.  Thank goodness that we didn't have to pay for to get in but still....If they want people to start dancing, they need to hire party girls to interact with the customers and pump the crowd =)"

We ate at lots of well rated restaurants-  Mon Ami Gabi, Red Square, Nine Fine Irishmen, Fleur, Verandah, and Ri Ra to name some.  Of all the restaurants this one was over the top pretentious FOR NO REASON.\n\nDuring our mid week October stay we had reservations at several of the above mentioned restaurants.  It was unnecessary as there weren't many people in Las Vegas.  When we arrived at Mix without a reservation we were told they don't accept walk ins.  (Very rudely).  Then we went back to our hotel room in Mandalay Bay and called.  My husband was told that they were booked for the entire night.  I logged onto yelp and booked a table through Opentable.com that was 7 minutes later.  We walked right back.  The same hostess seated us.  Silly!!!!\n\nThe waiter was overly chatty and not very attentive to our needs (vegetarian, gluten free).  Even to the point not to tell me there was HAM in one of the breads they bring to the table.  My husband had a steak and asparagus.  I had the gnocchi.  Neither was anything special at all.\n\nThe best part of the experience was standing on the bar balcony after dinner.

Very pricey, small portions like your typical fine dining establishment but that's expected when you dine in places like these. I ordered their duck, probably the best duck I've ever had in my life. My plate had two duck breast, the skin was perfectly crisp and I ate the entire plate, the presentation was exquisite. My boyfriend ordered the tuna tartar, another winner, again probably the best tartar I've ever had, mind you I've had my fair share of fine dining. We ordered the mushroom friasse as a side, wow, delicious, different array of mushrooms together, we throughly enjoyed our dinner there. The waitstaff was attentive and they even brought out a small treat out for my boyfriend's birthday with a candle on it, even though they normally don't do that is what I'm told. Normally whatever dessert you order they write happy birthday on it. Oh did I mention the pretty dining room we dined in? Very beauitful with white looking bubbles hanging down parts of the restaurant, I loved everything about the restaurant, my only complaint was they should put the lounge in the back of the place and the restaurant up front so upon exiting the elevators you walk right into the restaurant. \n\nNow for the Lounge review, wow, awesome place, the view of the strip is amazing!!!! Def. come here to take a cool photo on their balcony with the vegas strip behind you. Music was great!! The tables inside are first come first serve as long as it does not have a reserved sign, part of the balcony outside is reserved only for bottle service. We loved the music they played there, the selection was mixed and they played old stuff along with new. We had such a fun time here after our dinner. \n\nI will definitely be returning to this joint when I visit Vegas again!"

And he blew me away with his knowledge of wine, regions, vineyards and history when totally caught off guard. He was prepared for every question we had, topic of discussion. He proceeds to modestly share that he worked for The French Laundry. He was sooo attentive, so friendly and his presence and skill at his job just left me in awe. Seriously. Anyway, to the food. We were brought a bread basket with some very unique spreads and butters. Try them all. Hands down the best filet I have ever tasted. Pepper crusted with a bernaise sauce. My friend wanted to order the Wagyu like we've had before out here for about $10 an oz. $34 an oz here! No thanks! The bison tenderloin he chose was a perfect substitute!

When we asked if we were headed in the correct direction we received a smug answer with a stone face. Making it to the host stand we checked in and waited awkwardly as they found a table for us in an otherwise empty restaurant (3 other tables in the main area) We were seated in a booth along the exterior of the dining room, it was comfortable enough. \nWe observed several people walking by our table without acknowledgment taking at least 15 minutes to be spoken to by anyone who worked there. After we ordered dinner (two steaks, creamy spinach, and mac with ham- at the server's recommendation) we received a bread basket (it was okay but little did we know, the best part of the meal) the server assistant was polite and explained the basket with a smile. Dinner took a reasonable amount of time to deliver (25-30 min)   but was presented in a rather mediocre manner. The steaks had little color and no seared crispness to the crust (see the steak on the Excaliber Buffet Banner, it looked pretty similar) and came with a peppercorn sauce that had no trace of pepper and tasted of hormel packaged gravy. The garlic creamed spinach was rather bland with a demure garlic flavor, and the recommended mac and cheese was no better than purchased box mac with little chunks of deli ham in it. All items were under-seasoned and lacked the finesse of other fine dining restaurants. \nHowever on the plus side the portions are reasonable as are the prices for what you'll find in Vegas. We had a resort food credit so the meal was not a total loss, but I would definitely not spend my own money here."

I expect a good meal to be an event, but you've gotta keep me entertained with a full glass and some good snacks.  The place was also freezing.  This must be a common complaint because the waiter brought out a stack of blankets for the ladies that looked not at all unlike the rough, homespun smallpox blankets that the U.S. government gave to the Native Americans back in the 1800s.  \n\nThe food was decent.  My bison was cooked perfectly, albeit with a crust of peppercorns that was too peppery for even this lover of pepper.

Those things aren't thrown around willy-nilly. \nI'll give my quick rundown then get into the details:\nAtmosphere: 4\nService: 5\nFood: 4\n\nThe atmosphere is hard to beat when you're on the 64th floor facing out over the gorgeous Las Vegas strip. You enter the restaurant through the lounge which is dark and moody, but really lovely. It goes from nearly pitch black to an overwhelming sensation of light when you round the corner to the dining room. There is a massive 35 foot champagne bubble chandelier that takes over the center of the room. It's truly gorgeous and sets the mood for a classy but nouveau style experience. We were seated at a half booth, and one of my complaints was that the seating arrangements felt crowded. Not only could we hear the conversations on both sides of us, but I had to put my jacket behind me because my neighbors' jacket was nearly touching me. When the waiters have to slide the tables to let you get in, I think it's a little close. That bothered me just a bit as this was our romantic Valentines Day dinner and I was hoping for a little more intimacy. \n\nThe service was impeccable. It seemed like all we had to do was think of something that we wanted and someone appeared to make it happen. They have multiple attendants along with your individual server for each section and it pays off. We were never let wanting or waiting. We asked for a slow service and to not have our entrees fired until our appetizer had been cleared to give us time to enjoy the meal and it was done perfectly. Some places prefer not to do that because you take up time at the table, but they were very gracious and accommodated our request. The other thing I appreciated was the fact that they were there just enough-never over bearing. \n\nThe food is what I was really looking forward to. Their bread basket contained 5 types of bread and 2 butters. The ciabatta and sourdough were my favorites. Their house made peanut butter was to die for but didn't go with any of the breads. The house sommelier stopped by and we picked out first glass of wine to go with out appetizer, tender potato gnocchi with pumpkin, crispy bacon, and veal jus. It was to die for. My boyfriend who is just beginning his foray into the gastronomic world was blown away. In a different setting, I dare say he would have licked the plate. My entr\u00e9e was the surf & turf; lobster and stuffed chicken breast with salsify and wild mushrooms. The only dark spot on the plate was the chicken. I usually don't order chicken at restaurants because is it always overcooked, but I really wanted everything else on the plate. The chicken wasn't overcooked, but the 'stuffing' was lacking flavor and was so minimal. However, it was quickly picked up by the amazing flavor of the lobster and wild mushrooms. The salsify was cooked to perfection as well. It was incredibly delicious and there was so much lobster that I ate only a small portion of the chicken. My honey got the pork loin and belly over grits which he loved. There was also pulled pork in the pot that it came cooked in that tasted a little too much like its sauce came out of a Heinz can, but that's just my opinion. He enjoyed it all. The creamy grits really complemented the heavy smoky flavor of the pork belly. For dessert we split the 'candy bar' which is their homemade cookie center candy bar. It was really good. The chocolate was smooth and creamy and the filling was crunchy and sweet. We were so full at that point, but they brought around freshly baked vanilla-bean Madelines and nutella as a 'parting gift.' Of course I put mine away quickly seeing as how Madelines and nutella are two of my favorite things. Their Madelines were perfection. \n\nThe bill came out to $220 with tax and tip, and I find that to be very reasonable for what it was. It was a great dinner and we finished with a drink in the lounge looking out over the strip. Good times!"

The dining area was a little difficult to find because when we got off the elevator--- there was the lounge and bar area and we had to walk through this area to get to the dining room.  There is outdoor dining but we sat inside.  We were seated immediately even though 2 girls were extremely late.  We had a table near the curtain made of glass.  Our server was very charming and accommodating.  The 2 girls were 30+ minutes late which was very rude but staff was good about it and never gave us any grief.  The mgr was very sweet also, he helped with taking order when our server was busy and also took pictures for us.  The food was better than I expected.  I didn't know what I was going to get with this restaurant but it turned out to be very good.  I ordered a cocktail which I enjoyed.  My entree was really good from what I can remember.  We were on a time crunch because we had to be somewhere else so we didn't get dessert.  Again, would definitely recommend if you haven't been.  Try it out for yourself...you can't beat the view."

The light white was a nice change to the usual darkness of lots of other restaurants.  We sat at a nice round table that was big enough for our party of six.  However, the room did not absorb the noise very well and at times, it was hard to hear the other across the table during our conversations.\n\nThe food was delicious.  I had the sea bass as an entree.  It was firm and flaky with a delicious buttery taste.  I tasted my wife's filet and it was very tender and cooked perfectly.\n\nThe service was very attentive and professional.  They came by frequently but they were not intrusive.\n\nThe view of the strip was amazing from this spot."

They have such a spectacular view of the strip!...\n\nhonestly speaking though, that's about it!....I came here for valentines day with my husband and sat right by the windows facing the strip. Everything besides the view was ok. The foie gras and steak were delicious but what killed our experience was the glass door! It kept opening on it's own from the wind or the waiters opening them up. We probably exchanged eye rolls and looks with everyone on that side of the restaurant that night! What a mood killer! when the wind blew the tablecloths would fly up and our food would get colder and colder. they clearly know this is a problem because everyone acted so casual when they saw all the patrons getting annoyed. I couldn't enjoy my dinner because it got cold so quickly and every few minutes the door flew open so you had to 'hold it down'. There were no apologies nor did anyone stand near the door to hold it shut...major flaw. I highly recommend sitting on the other side of the restaurant or simply just visiting the bar for the view."

He timed it right and was extremely knowledgeable about all the food.\n\nEvery single thing on the prix fixe menu was amazing. Every item was unique enough to make me think, and though I probably wasn't able to fully appreciate the presentation, it slapped me in the face with flavor I couldn't misunderstand. The lamb dish was the best I've ever had. Dessert kept coming...3 items that were ridiculously good!\n\nMy mom had the cod and it was a huge portion with unbelievable flavor. She had a $9 side with the cod ($36) and it was plenty of food. These prices are REASONABLE when you're on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay.\n\nBONUS\nRandy took the time to explain that MIX is one of the few restaurants in Vegas that actually serves PRIME beef, pastured meats, and most everything is organic. There are plenty of other places on the strip with prices this high and lower quality food so don't be fooled into thinking these prices are ridiculous. They're just not."

He was presentable, professional and well spoken . He sold us a bottle of Grey Goose vodka in the VIP section of the balcony with the best view in the house. \n\nNot long after we were seated the bottle came out with all of the mixers of our choice. The lovely cocktail waitress Amber took care of us and was always on hand to make sure our drinks were topped up and to take photos. \n\nRichard dropped in and checked on our group periodically throughout the night to talk to us, make us feel welcome and make sure we were taken care of. An example of his fine Hosting skills came into play when one of my girlfriends felt a little cold. Richard went out of his way to get her a blanket to throw over her legs so she was comfortable. \n\nI can't say enough about the way we were hosted by Richard and actually treated like VIP's. It's subtle differences I noticed that made a big difference in our experience. From creating an atmosphere where we felt like we where special, important and comfortable to genuinely taking an interest in our conversations and catering to our needs, we were all very impressed to say the least \n\nWords got around about our experience. I now have some more friends coming into town over the next few months and have requested to hit up the Mix for a night out hosted by Richard. We will be back for sure!"

I had to knock off a star because, honestly, our waiter was terrible, not just at this pricepoint, but even if he was a waiter for Applebees.  He was a nice guy and trying hard (I guess?) but he was shockingly bad, like, unacceptably bad at a place this nice.  I mean, he was comical... dropping forks, plates, bumping into fellow waiters, etc... multiple times.  I used to wait tables as a teenager and I was never so clumsy.\n\nAnyway...\n\nWe had a reservation for 7:00pm on a weekend, we were seated promptly on the outdoor porch area, ordered some amazing apps.  We had a party of about eight, two of which didn't have water.  We had to ask the waiter a couple times for the water, which he kept forgetting.  We finally found the guy who gave us the bread (amazing variety) and he took care of it right away.  The waiter then went MIA.  We finally had the buser (the bread guy) flag him down and he came back over to take our orders around 7:30.  I only ordered a Diet Coke to drink (too tired for any alcohol).  He never brought it, went MIA again.  \n\nWe waited and waited and waited for our food.  Tables seated around us were getting their food and beverages before us even though they were seated long after we were, so I know the kitchen wasn't slow.  \n\nWe started walking around the restaurant and got talking to the manager, who was so ridiculously nice.  We were admiring the wine cellar and he took us in to show us, which was so cool of him.  That was definitely a really cool note of the night.  \n\nWe finally got our food, no joke, at 8:45.  That would normally be fine if people were getting their drinks filled and so on.  \n\nStill no Diet Coke.  \n\nThe food arrived at 8:45, I reminded the waiter of my Diet Coke, he said he's be right on it.  I ordered the cod.  Uh-mazing.  Everyone's food was spot on.  We were starving so we 'enjoyed' our food a little more quickly than usual, done probably in 15-20 minutes.  \n\nNo Diet Coke still.  Our of principle, I told one of the busers that I ordered a Diet Coke which I never received... and I had it within a minute.  Top notch on that end.  \n\nWith all of that said, one terrible waiter couldn't deter an amazing nice of good food and conversation in a great place.  If we had any other waiter, it would be five stars.  I know for sure that other tables had top notch waiters, which is expected at a place like this.  Ours, unfortunately, was in way over his head.  \n\nPaying the bill was the same thing... trying to track him down... waiting for the receipt to sign... then waiting for him to take it up.  We didn't get out of there until, literally 10pm.  \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Get away from the pretentious, overpriced places in the middle of the strip and enjoy a night out here, trust me on this - just avoid our waiter ;)"

We had a large group and didn't want to pay ridiculous money to get into a club, and we happened upon a MIX worker with free passes.  BINGO!\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about MIX is just about the only thing you'll notice: the VIEW.  The floor to very-tall-ceiling windows allow for a view of the strip you've never imagined.  The dancefloor is situated at the corner of the building and gives you about a 270 degree view.  \n\nThe balcony is where everyone wants to be, so you have to fight the crowd to get an outside look at the strip.  But trust me, its well worth it.\n\nThe decor is trendy modern/contemporary.  Though I didn't use them, I heard the restrooms have an equally impressive view.  Who wouldn't want to poop with a view?  The better question is why I didn't use the restrooms in the 4 hours we were at the lounge, but that's for me to figure out and you to feel awkward about now.\n\nI had to subtract one star for the exorbitant prices for EVERYTHING at the bar:\n\nWater?  That'll be $10. \nBeer?   That'll be at least $8.\nCocktail?  That'll be at least $12  \"YOU FOOL!!!\" (stated in Dark Helmet's voice from Spaceballs)\n\nI will definitely go back to MIX eventually, but I'll have to save up in the meantime."

The view of the strip is great, but that's about it. The crowd was made up mostly of people in their 40's and 50's, not particularly trendy or good looking. The DJ was spinning some 80's Michael Jackson songs. There is a small dance floor, where a couple in their 40's was grinding against each other. Not great at all! We left this place after 5 mins. Won't go back anytime soon. \n\nIn all honesty, the concept is good and would probably work in a city like LA (see for example, The Standard Rooftop Bar), but it simply doesn't work in Vegas where people are looking for more, not just a beautiful rooftop lounge."

The high ceilings and glass and granite surfaces create an echo effect, so every sound reverberates off the walls and floors and just makes for an unsettling dining experience.\n\nAcoustics aside, the food was pretty decent, although not quite as impressive as we had hoped. The best dish of the evening was the Spicy Crab Salad. Elegantly presented on a bed of guacamole and topped with shredded heart of palm, it was lively and fresh and made you feel like you were at a resort in Cabo. The Cod Brandade was acceptable, but I was expecting exceptional. The lemon and capers just weren't enough to brighten up the bland brown butter sauce and the soggy fried parsley. And the Duck Breast was so forgettable that I simply forgot what went with it.\n\nWe were very impressed, however, with the wine service. We didn't want to order a bottle, so we just asked the somm to pair our dishes for us. He seemed to enjoy the challenge and was a delight to talk to.\n\nOne last note: I realize there isn't much the restaurant can do, but people really should not bring young children to these kinds of places. It's inappropriate and inconsiderate to your fellow diners -- especially so at Mix because the sound of your rug rats squealing and shouting gets amplified throughout the entire restaurant."

Mike however made sure we were taken care of beginning to finish. The cod and gnocchi was AMAZING. My girls ordered the taste menu and the dessert was the best thing ever.\n\n\nMike- you will be half of the reason I come back to mix. Other half? The amazing cod of course ;)"

The staff is warm, there are various menu choices, the setting is intimate, topped with a gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip. Additionally the food was well prepared and extremely flavorful. My Filet Minion was tender with flavor oozing out, and my Boyfriend's Roasted Maine Lobster Au Curry was savory and inviting to my fork. There was room for desert so we ordered a decadent cheesecake with sorbet and oooooooooooo it was so good!! As a persnickety New York foodie, I was amazingly impressed by this restaurant, and if I am ever in Vegas again, I will definitely make another reservation."

The lounge has a perfect view of the strip along with great service and the decor is amazing.  \n\nFirst of all I hate clubs so you will never see me at one.  Lounges however is another story.  I like to hang out with friends and enjoy there company, rather than going to a club and trying to hit on some skank.  Since it was our first night we opted for a table, and the prices were reasonable for Las Vegas.  190 for Stoli with all the mixers including Mojito Mix, and Sugar Free Red Bull= Hell yes!  The cocktail waitress was German or something but she was quite cute and entertaining.  She actually ended up becoming part of our party.  She always made sure the mixers were stocked, and she also brought out a fruit platter along with cookies free of charge.  Of course we ended up tipping her quite well, but with service like that, why wouldn't you?"

It was not packed and we got a great seat with an awesome view easily, but were then ignored by the cocktail waitress for a good 30 minutes, even as she served all of the tables around us. We decided to go to the bar, and it took another 15 minutes to finally get a drink in our hands -- a $14 vodka and ginger ale! I understand charging high prices for martinis and complicated concoctions, but soda with vodka? Oh my. We went back to our seat and when our drinks were empty, we were again ignored for a lengthy period by the waitress. We flagged her down and she was quite rude and said she would serve us but it was last call (this was around midnight and the bar was half full still). She brought us back our vodka and ginger ales but this time had charged $18 each. We asked why and she said she didn't know how to charge for ginger ale so she had made it up, and said she would fix it if we wanted. We had to point out the bartender who served us (there was only one guy working though, so what the???) so she could check out our story with him and find out how to charge for ginger ale.  She did fix the bill, but was pretty jerky about it. Then, at 12:30 the manager came around to all of the tables (about 10 tables full of people at this point) and politely asked us to leave so his staff could go home. (So it really isn't open until 2 every night as listed here on Yelp.) I guess we should be thankful that service was so painfully slow and snooty, because we would have bought several more rounds in the 3 hours we were there, spent a lot more money, probably would have come back again and spent even more money, would have recommended it to our friends who would have spent a bunch of their money, too. So I guess they saved us and our friends a lot of cash, so we should really be grateful. No view is worth being treated like dirt. What a shame."

Each dish has some unexpected taste to it... which made the meal very good overall. It is always a little worrying when you try to put so much money for ONE meal, we are afraid to be disappointed, and not get the value, but this was not the case at the Mix.

My bouche was not one bit amused.\n\nFor appetizer, the DH had the veggie terrine, which was perfect. I had a sea bream sashimi thing, which was very very fishy and rich, good for the first 3 bites and then a little too overwhelming. \n\nFor main course, the DH had the special that day which was filet mignon with fois gras and truffles. this was the best beef we've ever had, and at $75, it had better be! (keep in mind that we've never been to a steakhouse, I'm just not that passionate about steak). \nI don't remember what I had, it was good, but not amazing, not nearly as good as the filet mignon...can't believe I don't rememer it, I always remember what I eat!!\n\npre-dessert--my favorite part of the entire meal-- this drink with mango, passion fruit and some other things at the bottom and coconut foam sort of thing on top, the coconut part was a little warm and mango part very cold, it was heavenly!!!\n\nthe dessert...oh the dessert was really really good-- I remember the champagne gelee and panna cotta with the 24k gold leaf on top being my favorite (maybe because both were fruit based). but all the desserts from the sampler tray were good. \n\nUploading pictures of everything--this is where I wished I had brought my own camera rather than using the DH's point&shoot. \n\nafter tax & tip and a restaurant.com $50 off, the bill came to about $220. Aureole downstairs in Mandalay Bay is still our favorite restaurant and about $50 less expensive. \n\nI'd give 4.2 stars for the food and 2.5 stars for the service, 4.5 stars for the decor.

The view alone was worth the visit to Mix. The service was impeccable. The meal was delicious. We had a cappacio of some sort of white fish for appetizer. I can't remember the name but the dish was phenomenal. Bursting with flavors, the fish was fresh and the taste was fantastically balanced. My hunnie had a pork roast which was served in a mini personal roasting pot. THAT had tasted so good, I kept stealing from him. I had bison for the first time. It was good, but not wow. The peppercorn gave it a nice kick, but compared to the pork roast... it just wasn't as good. yeah, so i kept stealing from my hunnie and he ended up finishing my bison for me. hee.\n\nAfter dinner, we headed over to the other (the black side) of Mix for drinks on the other outdoor patio. There, they had these bedlike sofas which you can lay down upon and drink your drinks seductively. Very cozy. Highly recommended. Oh, and if you're at Mix, you HAVE to HAVE to check out the bathroom in the black/clubby side. You have this amazing floor to ceiling window in your bathroom stall and your \"throne\" is placed so that you sit FACING the pretty lights of vegas. It's quite dramatic.

I thought to myself, \"well even if the food is so-so like I read, its got a great view and cool decor.\"\n\nWell I guess since I had lower expectations, I ended up being pretty happy with the experience. First thing I should mention, you really should view MIX as a French-influenced American steakhouse, as opposed to a French restaurant along the lines of Le Cirque. If you look at the menu, you'll notice how similar it is to a classic steakhouse. That said, the food isn't going to be mindblowing, but it is really good, albeit pricey. I love Foie gras, but at $32 for an app, this was the most I ever paid for it...but it was a nice sized portion and it was cooked perfectly. My filet mignon was perfect also, and i needed that after the chewy hangar steak I had at Sage the previous night. Dessert was a passion fruit souffle...again, very good...moist and eggy. \n\nThe service was good, the setting was really cool..it really looks great in there at night with the lights dimmed...and the view was great also, althoguh tough to see because of the reflection on the windows. The elevator ride up is quite an experience also... a glass-enclosed elevator on the outside of theHOTEL giving you a view for the ride all the way up and back down. \n\nIt was worth going to once, especially with the $50 off, but I don't think I'll be returning with all the other places in Vegas to try."

We had a cute table for 2 that overlooked all of Las Vegas!! \n\nThe seating is really close to all the other couples which at first was a little weird but then turned out to be great we were all suggesting different dishes to our new friends. I had a lentil soup to die for and a seafood medley the portions are small yet filling. \n\nThey have a wine list to die for it might be the best one i have ever encountered. The wine cellar is all glass and displayed as part of the decor.

            "review": "It was a Saturday night and we were staying at the Mandalay Bay. It was around 10pm and we wanted to grab drinks and check out the view from the Mix Lounge. Our whole ordeal with getting ID's checked, getting asked \"how many in your party\", getting our wrists stamped and shot up in a lift took about 5 minutes, in that short time I was able to witness one of the bouncers acting like the world's biggest douche with the various people who walked up. He was ridiculous, but it was entertaining to watch.\n\nSince the new City Centre development got built there's pretty much no view from up here any more, but it does have a small smoking patio or outdoor seating in the VIP area. The restauraunt side looks far more inviting than the dark lounge.\n\nThe DJ was off the hook...whoever that DJ was he kept us dancing and singing all night long! Our cocktails were about $10 which I guess is ok for Vegas. There was always somewhere for us to sit and take a break from the dancing and one of the stalls in the bathroom had a view.\n\nInteresting place... I liked it and recommend it!"

It is a beautiful restaurant with ultra chic decor.  The winding staircase and hanging glass balls are a nice touch.  I originally wanted to give it a 3, but the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a lower review.  \n\nFirst of all, my BF and I were seated at the opposite end of where we wanted to sit (the side facing the strip).  We got bread with two kinds of butter.  Regular and peanut butter butter.  I didn't really like the peanut butter butter very much.  And the bread was difficult to cut.  I like it when they give you bread that's already cut up so all you have to do is tear it off from the bread bowl.  Especially when you're sharing with a group of people.  Who wants to eat it after someone grabs it with their hands and cuts it up. \n\nI wasn't very hungry so decided to not do the prixe fixe meal and instead decided to get 2 appetizers and a salad for my entree.  We got the foie gras and tuna tartare to start.  It was good, but I've definitely had better.   My $20 appetizer salad was light and refreshing but still left me unsatisfied.  My BF got the lobster with rice and I must say that it was delicious.  For $50, it better be!  \n\nThe wine: we opted to share a bottle of Pinot Grigio.  The wine guy, likely not a master sommelier barely said a word.  My BF tried the wine and he approved and said would you like to try it? The guy starts pouring me a full glass.  I guess we are getting this bottle whether I like it or not.  \n\nThe service:   Umm service was not great.  Just mediocre.  Our waiter was nice and took some pics for us but the host was not so friendly.  We had a restaurant.com gift certificate but didn't print it out and asked if we could still use it.  It was in email format and my BF pulled it up on his phone.  At first they said that it was fine and later French host dude with an attitude came back and said sorry our mistake, that was for someone else.  But said that we would get something complimentary from the chef.  I was excited, yay! free stuff.  They brought out this drink in a martini glass.  French dude said, it's non-alcoholic because \"I'm not sure if you're 21.\"  I don't know whether he was trying to be funny or not, because clearly I was drinking wine all night already and was still sipping on my last glass when he came.  So I decided to try it.  It was not good.  Then I looked over the other tables and saw that people got the same thing.  It could be that they may very well have ordered that.  Or the chef was just giving those away to everybody that night.  \n\nOverall, food was pretty good, but for the price, I also expect stellar service.  This restaurant did not meet my expectations."

I've visited the lounge twice now (one time they wanted $20 cover, which I would definitely not pay to come to this place). The experience begins with a quick elevator ride up tot he top of the tower. The glass elevator is open to the outside, so you can get a nice view of the strip on the way up. The biggest highlight of MIX is definitely the view. There is an outdoor patio area with lounge chairs and such to soak it all in. Even the bathroom urinals offer a nice view of Mandalay Bay's pool complex. The drinks weren't as imaginative as the Chandelier Bar at the Cosmopolitan, and were a bit on the pricey side, but the view and ambiance is nice, which is basically why you would come here in the first place."

Champagne was delivered on the house, along with an egg caviar, and incredible dessert martini. \n\nI didn't eat the bread, but the butter placed on the table was too good to resist.....one of them featured nougats and mango. \n\nI started with the tuna tartare, placed on a fancy block of chopped root vegetables, served with taro root chips. The peanut satay sauce was the perfect addition to the fish. \n\nI also ordered the lobster gazpacho. I expected it to be some acidic, tomato-filled, lime- juice soup....BUT THEN, they brought the wonderful dish to my table. 5 nice slices of lobster with chopped cucumber, cilantro, tomato, and COCONUT MILK!!!!!! I can't even explain how simply decadent the gazpacho was. One-of-a-kind. \n\nI've heard the Lobster Curry is as good or better than the lobster gazpacho.......\n\nWho knew the Mandalay Bay could get this fancy?

Not because they were crowded but because the woman downstairs was very insistent that they opened, \"in 7 minutes.\" \n\nWhen we finally got upstairs there was no one in sight. We wandered around the backside of the bar to watch the sun set and found the staff still in their pre-opening staff meeting. The manager politely indicated they would be with us as soon as they were through. i.e. Go away, you'll get a drink when WE'RE ready.  I let him know we'd be outside when they were done.  \n\nUnfortunately, the patio is on the wrong side of the building to watch the sun set - but I guess we're there to see Vegas, right?\n\nEventually one of the waitresses sauntered out.  I ordered a glass of Scharffenberger champagne.  It was a surprisingly reasonable $13.  Their other by the glass champagnes are higher-end and French with prices reaching $30.  Their cheapest champagne is $12 - one from New Mexico?!?  I've had it before and it wasn't pretty.   Gruet is served everywhere in LV, and I mean everywhere!  Sorry, New Mexico, but I have rules while in Vegas!  \n\nLas Vegas rule #5: no champagne from New Mexico!\n\nI would go back for the view (make sure you check what time sunset starts) and the drinks, but not management's attitude. \n\nOH!  And be sure to check out their bathrooms.  If you go early like we did you can see them both.\n\nI've heard the food there is amazing, but will check that out next time."

Even if you are not hotel guests, you might be able to convince the guy to get you in for free (if you go before 10pm).  The views at the rooftop are amazing, there is an outdoor patio area where you can smoke, drink, and chill.  Indoor tables are open to all guests, just grab a seat and order drinks.  There is also a mini dance floor with clear glass windows overlooking the strip.  The bar is small, but drinks are served quickly and the prices are much better than going to any club.   I like the fact that there are open tables which don't require you to pay an arm and leg to reserve.  Drink prices are reasonable and the views are nice!

We made reservations through the Mandalay Bay website, and were sent a confirmation a week in advance.  When we arrived for dinner, we were told they \"couldn't find\" our reservation, and that the confirmation number we were sent was useless because they only searched them by name.  (WHY HAVE ONE THEN??)  I went upstairs to speak to the manager, and realized what had happened as we watched them turn others away.  They had sold out the dining room, thereby negating all of our reservations, and then had the gall to tell us it was somehow our fault for not booking right, or that it was computer error.  They finally relented to us staying, but only if we could be \"out before the party arrived,\" effectively putting us on the clock at a hundred dollar a head restaurant.  Unacceptable. \n\nThat said, the Pepercorn Filet was the best I've ever had.  Whomever is charged with steaks in this kitchen knows his stuff.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly tender.

I usually don't prefer eating super fatty meats, but I'll make an exception for the pork belly. The fat actually augmented to the flavor of the dish greatly, and it wouldn't be pork belly w/o the fat. The only complaint I have is that it is a little bit on the salty side.

            "review": "Food 5 stars: \n\nComplimentary bread basket- The bread basket included foccacia, fruit and nut bread, wheat bread, and baguette. The fruit and nut bread is the best piece of bread I have ever tasted. It was very moist, warm, and absolutely delicious. It wasn't too sweet or to oily, it was so good that we got seconds. The focaccia bread wasn't that special and tasted a little strange to me. \n\nComplimentary foie gras- We all got a small tasting of foie gras and it was pretty good. I only ate a bite though, because the feeling of goose liver haunts me. \n\n1. Surf and Turf (lobster and chicken) $38 - This is what I called surf and turf. I love how they use chicken instead of beef, much healthier. I usually eat chicken and lobster every other day, so my palate was designed to taste this dish. The chicken was awesome, and it was stuffed with spinach. It was soft moist and not oily. The stuffing was beautifully placed inside the chicken. The lobster was pretty decent, but not the best I have tasted. The portion size for this dish was very generous and filling. \n\n2. Seared Scallops $38- There were only three scallops on the plate, but what can you expect. I have learned to ask the server how many scallops before ordering them, because the usual is 2-4. The scallops were cooked very properly and were very tender. The only complaint is the portion size, because the other two parties had to fill up on the bread. \n\n3. Creamed Spinach $9- Ordered with less cream. I didn't ask how it tasted like, but it looked like he enjoyed it.\n\n4. Sauteed Asparagus $9- A moment of heaven with vegetables. My mom usually cooks some of the best vegetables in the world, so I love to eat vegetables, but at the same time I hate flavorless vegetables. It was the best couple of asparagus spears I have ever tasted. It was so soft, moist, and full of flavor. Absolutely amazing. It is a must order sied to go with the meal.\n\nComplimentary dessert- The chef never lets you leave without something sweet. We were offered each one madeline with a chocolate dipping sauce and it was wonderful. The perfect way to end a meal without stuffing yourself. \n\nService 5 stars: \n\nOur waiter was kind and polite even when we wanted to change tables. He always refilled on beverages whenever needed, and didn't stand over us like a school teacher. We were surprised that out entrees arrived so quickly ( I wasn't even finished with my first loaf of bread), because it was a busy night. \n\nAtmosphere 5 stars: \n\nI took so many pictures that night! The atmosphere was fantastic. There were like glass bubbles that hung down from the rood, the restaurant was pearl white, and there was a beautiful staircase in the center of the restaurant. There are tables for business groups as well as a cozy date. JUST BEAUTIFUL!"

Went here with a large group of friends, probably 14 of us and had an excellent time.\n\nThe ambiance: On the lighter side and that huge dining area is so welcoming that it gives you room to breath. Loved the decor and the bubbly chandeliers. I mean whats not nice in Vegas.\n\nFood: We got a few orders of Tuna Tartare, cheese salami and prosciutto platter and some other appetizer cant remember. K so my main 5 stars are based on the filet Mignon steak with Foie Gras this was by far the most memorable Filet I've had. Cooked to perfection and the foie gras being on top of the meat gave all the oils and juices to the filet which made it more outstanding. \n\nService: All right normal\n\nOverall if you're seeking a place that serves great steak and want to try or simply have foie gras try this place out it should impress you."

We each tried their tasting menu with wine pairing and it included the following: \n\nAmuse Bouche \n\nSpicy Crab Salad: This was super fresh and made a great starter to the rest of the meal. The portion was great too. The Riesling that it was paired with was excellent as well. \n\nButternut Squash Ravioli: served with butter emulsion and super creamy...probably my favorite dish! Another white was served along with it. \n\nSeared diver scallops: the scallop was excellent, however, I did not enjoy the citrus endive marmalade it was served with...kinda reminded me of sour onions. \n\nRack of Colorado Lamb: it was served with piquillo peppers and delicious. At this point in time it was getting harder and harder to enjoy my wine, so the hubby had to start helping me with the wine pairings. We had already enjoyed a few at the lounge before dinner is my excuse! \n\nPre-dessert: was more like a very sweet & tangy, frothy shake. \n\nArmagnac ice cream: a creamy puff pastry...took one bite and I was done! This one is served with a port and I'm not a fan of port so I passed on it. \n\nService: Excellent! Our server was awesome and he even allowed my hubby to swap out his scallops for the lobster with no extra charge. We used a restaurant.com coupon and had no problem at all...it was definitely worth it. \n\nI was pretty happy with our meal here, but also pretty buzzed by the end of meal too! Overall, great place to enjoy a romantic dinner or for small groups."

When we arrived, they sat us in between booths where couples were able to sit right next to each other.  We ended up having to sit across from each other.  I felt discriminated because we were Asian.  But its OK, because our waiter was nice and helpful.\n\nI ordered the Crispy Halibut, and my boyfriend ordered the Beef Tenderloin.  Both were extremely good.  We had the Tuna Tartar for an appetizer and it was oober yummy!  Fresh tuna, and the avocado paired with it...yum!  It was served w/ taro chips!  Great combinations.  The Halibut was on a bed of Eggplant caviar...so good and another awesome combination.  Texture of all my food was good and my man's too!  \n\nWe even ordered a side dish of macaroni salad and ham.  It was DELISH!  \n\nThe atmosphere wasn't too romantic and the side where we were seated only had the view of The Orleans casino.  If  we were seated on the other side we would have had a view of the strip.  They even have outside seating on the strip view side..best in the summer of course.  \n\nI wouldn't mind going again!

It is so refreshing, and the sauce they made was so good.\nFor main course, i ordered the lamb loin which was sooooo delicious too. The favor of the lamb is so refined and you wount find that bad lamb smell. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was so tender. The layered potato was such a great plus as well, and there was even a lamb stuffed chili which was unique and flavorful.\nA must try, if not for the food, please enjoy their lounge area!! \nI went with my girlfriends and we had a great time.

Truly a beautiful space it will be interesting to see where the Delano takes Ducasse and \"Rivea,\" but as long as they keep the signatures there is no doubt it is a space worth visiting, even if only for dessert with a view."

            "review": "I'm not really a club sort of guy. I like bars, especially ones with good bartenders. I really like clubs where you can hear live music. I also really like Vegas - but I want to gamble in Vegas. I also don't want to pay tons of money for my drinks. I'd rather a buxom woman in a costume that is meant to be sexy but instead comes off silly and a wee bit sad (especially if she's a wee bit too old to be wearing such an outfit) hand me a drink for free in recognition of the fact that I'm playing a game where the odds are not in my favor.\n\nSpeaking as a man who went to Mix one recent Friday night - the odds are not in my favor, and they will probably not be in your favor either, Sonny Jim. \n\nMy brother had his bachelor party in Vegas recently, and a local thought it would be a great idea for a bunch of us to go in on a table at Mix. Once we got there and learned it would be $50 a person, enthusiasm waned. Apparently, the local put the reservation on her credit card, so I was down $50 before even playing the tables... or getting a drink.\n\nThe elevator ride revealed the best part of Mix - the view. There's an outdoor patio area with fantastic views of the Strip. All night long there are a stream of sightseers and picture-takers hanging out there.\n\nOur group settled into a decent-sized banquette, while a hostess prepared drinks. Our table came with a bottle of vodka, a bottle of champagne, a bottle of rum, and a bottle of whiskey... for 20 people. Luckily, the hostess knew how to make an old fashioned, and the whiskey was the least popular alcohol among my younger brother's friends - more for me.\n\nThe immediate downside of the club was noticeable. It was 10:00 p.m. and the place was nearly empty. Advertising portrays these exclusive nightclubs as the domain of the rich, the famous, the impossibly good-looking. Then you look up from your giant ice cube-covered bottle of \"super-premium\" vodka and realize that instead it's filled with people like you hoping to mingle with people not like you. At that point, you probably want to drink, and wouldn't you know it? Giant ice cube-covered bottle of super-premium vodka. With mixers!\n\nOne serious point of criticism. I'm a music fan, though I'm much more likely to be into indie rock than house or techno. I also currently live in the middle of nowhere. I should not know more about dance music than the DJ in a Las Vegas nightclub. The music was heavy on mashups and 80's retro. Seemed to me that this would be the perfect set for a some Girl Talk. After all, Feed The Animals is basically the Citizen Kane of mashup albums. So I asked the DJ (using the Notes feature on my iPhone as the club was impossibly loud even when near empty) to play some Girl Talk. He had never heard of Girl Talk or Feed The Animals. He was friendly and seemed interested in knowing more. But Feed The Animals was Blender's #2 recording of 2008. Time magazine wrote it up for crying out loud.  It was exactly the genre of music that the club seemed to play for the 3+ hours I was there. Remember the previous paragraph? We've already established that I'm not cool. What if I'm not cool AND I'm the coolest one in the club? The mind boggles.\n\nDid I mention the dance floor is about the size of my kitchen? That's also a big strike. So assuming you lived on the 64th floor of your apartment, had a bottle of something and a big ice cube, downloaded Feed The Animals off of the illegal art website, and were in your kitchen, you could have almost as much fun as I had at Mix, without the pricey cover.\n\nOn the other hand, it's probably worth a visit if you've got a group of friends willing to go in on bottle service with you, if only for one night of faux high-rolling."

The bar uses dark colors reminiscent of flames, because as we all know, drinking is evil and alcohol is the work of the devil. The main dining area uses light colors without seeming bright or harsh. It's surrounded by a curtain of glass handblown balls that are supposed to represent rain from the heavens. A few of the tables are sheltered by a white pod that looks like something from Star Trek. We sat outside, with a perfect view of the gigantic glittering sign for THEhotel at eye level. I guess that means we were in Purgatory? \n\nIn the bar, I ordered a $16 cocktail called Violet, which was fruity but not cutesy or too sweet. It was delicious and potent. When we sat down at our table, we were given a basket of different kinds of bread and proceeded to tear little nibbles off of each one, slathered them in peanut-butter (I'd say it was one part peanut butter to 10 parts butter) and very satisfingly ruined our collective appetites. \n\nWe easily chose our meals - I had the pistachio crusted sea bass with parmesan foam and a side of \"the best macaroni & cheese you'll ever have.\" The sea bass was fantastic. The mac & cheese was okay, but not the best I've ever had - everyone knows I like it cheap & gooey. I tasted some of my companions' meals too - bison in a peppery crust, duck breast, and gnocchi. All really tasty and beautifully prepared. \n\nMost of us didn't order appetizers because we were a little floored by the prices. My friends and I are Bay Area foodies, but this place was pretty expensive by our standards. The average main course was around $50, and appetizers were $20ish. \n\nBut what really stumped us was the wine list. We saw one bottle in there for $36,000. Another one for $12,000. Those were prices for cars, not wine. We asked the sommelier to help us choose a bottle of wine in the two-digit range, and he found a nice Australian Shiraz for us. It was excellent wine, but I don't typically spend more than $20 on a bottle, maybe $50 if it's especially nice. \n\nAll in all, we divided up the check among 7 of us, and each paid about $100. I'm afraid some people felt cheated who didn't drink wine or order an appetizer. I would have to say it was nice, but not nice enough to warrant those prices. It wasn't the French Laundry, yunno?"

It's a nice bar but the main feature is definitively the view! It sit on top of THEHotel at Mandalay Bay ans has a great view from the strip looking north. It has an outside area that can get quite windy as it was the case that week. Otherwise, i found that it was loud and generally expensive unless you go for a private party and don't have to pay (this was my case both times)."

            "review": "An exceptional dining experience, marred by a service indiscretion. \n\nI brought my team of Product Managers here for a nice dinner to top off a visit to Vegas for a conference. \n\nWe started in the lounge, which has an exceptional view of last Vegas from the top of \"the hotel\" on the strip. \n\nThe happy hour food was generally good, but not outstanding, and while the prices were decent, the portions were small. And thus we decided to move the the restaurant for dinner. \n\nThis was a bit of a turning point in the night - while we are at the lounge, the service was exceptional and friendly. We felt very welcome.\n\nWhen we moved over to the restaurant, a sudden air of snobbery hit us. The hostess did not seem at all happy to see us, and almost seemed hesitant to get us seated until we told her we had an open tab from the lounge and wanted to sit down for dinner - \"come back in 15 minutes\" she said coldly. \n\nWe came back 18 minutes later and were promptly seated. We ordered several nice bottles of wine, and lots of appetizers, entrees and several desserts (we got two of the souffle because the first went nearly instantly). \n\nI had the lobster curry dish, which was absolutely delicious. \n\nOur waiter was much friendlier than our stuffy hostess, and was generally attentive. \n\nWhen the bill came, it was expectedly high, but not exorbitant - about $800 for the few of us.\n\nI was surprised however with just one line item on the bill - $30 for 3 bottles of sparkling water. Apparently one of the folks at the table had asked for some, and it was given to the whole table, and they kept it flowing. \n\nNow $30 in the grand scheme of the bill is a drop in the bucket, but what really bothered me was how I was addressed when I asked about it:\n\n\"Did we really order $30 worth of water?\" The waiter stared at me coldly, and said almost condescendingly, \"yes.\" No explanation, no apology, nothing - just stared at me as if I was crazy for asking. \n\nGratuity was included, so I left an additional tip on the receipt: \"give a heads up for each new water bottle, especially at $10 a piece.\"\n\nWhat I really should have said was - \"don't act superior to your customers - you will crumble without them.\"\n\nAnyhow, I'm hoping it was just the couple of staff members I encountered, as the food was truly delicious, and the view from the lounge was incredible. However, I get the feeling that they breed this attitude of elitism into their restaurant staff - I wonder why?"

This is definitely not one of them.  Our friends ordered steaks which were mediocre at best.  I had the halibut which was dry and had no flavor.  I switched it for the salmon which was dry and also had no flavor.  It didn't end there.  We got the mac and cheese which tasted like kraft easy mac mixed with chopped pieces of deli ham.  The mashed potatoes were chalky and bland.  Im really not sure how you screw up mashed potatoes that badly.  I could have done better blindfolded.  Finally, my wife had the lobster, which was just ok, not great.  Overall, the ambience is amazing, but the food just flat out sucks.  To make matters worse, the bathrooms were absolutely filthy.  Las Vegas has too many outstanding restaurants to waste time and money with this place, especially for the price! I will never go back to this place, or to another one of Ducasse's restaurants for that matter."

The view was amazing, and the entire experience was absolutely unforgettable.  The cocktails were good, the couchy-like seating is so comfy and luxurious, the staff is AWESOME.  Literally every 2 minutes they came to empty our ash tray (and we were not chain smoking), and our server was so friendly and down-to-earth which is unusual for a place like this.  The bathrooms are out of this world.  The toilet is basically facing a glass wall overlooking the strip.  I kind of wanted to sit there for about ten minutes but I didn't want  people to think I was pooping so I just enjoyed it for maybe 30 seconds longer than I needed.\n\nOh and I almost forgot, the elevator ride is so much fun!  They take you up in a glass elevator and your knees start to feel a little bit weak.  \n\n5 stars, 100%, for everything.  Minus one star for ridiculous prices.  A little bowl of mac n cheese for $25?  I don't think so.  But you ARE paying for the view so I would definitely go here again.  I really think every time I'm in Vegas from now on, I will want my sunset cocktail at Mix."

The Gnocchi was delicate, fluffly, and almost chewy a great choice. The spicy crab and tuna tartare were good alternatives for starters as well.\n\nFor dinner, I had the dry aged rib eye and it was soo tender.  It comes with sauces, bordelaise or many others - but i didnt use them - no need.  The Beef cheeks (waygu) were slow braised in a rich wines sauce that was dark and complex - really delicious but very rich.

Most people seemed to be town for conventions, conference etc. We entered through The Hotel, checked in and seated right away. We were seated next to the window with the perfect view of the strip. I believe they have the best view because its at the end/beginning of the strip. Decor has that modern, monochromatic Philippe Stark look. The crowd was more of the professional 30+ crowd. \n\nSERVICE \nWe were greeted and seated right away and the waitstaff is professional, knowledgeable and best of all attentive. We never felt rushed or nor was there a lull in our service. Everything was timed perfectly. \n\nFOOD: \nAMAZING!! I went for the \"theatre\" tasting menu. We did start off with 2 different foie gras. One came with the tasting menu and we ordered another to taste a different application. We both decided that we like our foie gras seared. For the main course, my friend had lobster with curry sauce and for the tasting menu it was small plates of meat dishes. I actually didn't finish because it was a bit much for me. It was good, but can't eat much when you've been drinking. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back again and would recommend this restaurant for any special occasion and or foodie."

One of the meals was the $58 bison steak...it was colder than it was outside! Another meal was the sirloin. It was ordered butterflied and delivered as charred hockey pucks. The other meal (was mine) it was the barramundi fish. It was SO overdone I could barely cut it with a knife.\n\nAfter we sent our meals back....while the rest of our party enjoyed their meals they came back in an enjoyable state. Although, I ended up changing my order to the curried lobster...read in other reviews and would definitely recommend that dish!\n\nWe sat outside.

            "review": "***MIX provides a great view of The Strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of Las Vegas***\n\nMIX is the second Alain Ducasse restaurant I've tried.  The other one was in Tokyo and it was decent but not special.  Occasionally, the food at MIX felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  The food tastes slightly better than nearby Aureole (and the service is better too), but MIX just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.\n\nThe Alain Ducasse name is definitely a draw for MIX, but the atmosphere is too.  MIX sits on the 64th floor of the Mandalay Bay and you get a good view of The Strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  The dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  The lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.\n\nMIX offers several menu options.  There is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several Prime steaks.  There is also a seasonal MIX tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of Alain Ducasse signature dishes.  I decided to opt for the Alain Ducasse tasting menu.\n\n(Sweet corn soup amuse) The sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.\n\n(Assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) The breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  The addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.\n\n(Potato gnocchi, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) The gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and I prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  The asparagus was good.  The mushrooms were just okay, but I really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).\n\n(Seared foie gras, date puree, lemon confit) I added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty foie gras.  The foie gras was not that good though.  It was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.\n\n(Roasted Maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) The lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. The coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  It just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  And because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).\n\n(Filet mignon rossini, foie gras, black truffle) This was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  The filet was decent.  It was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but I did not think the quality of the meat was great.  The foie gras was similar to the a la carte foie gras where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great foie gras (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).\n\nThe black truffle was not that great either.  It was probably Australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  This truffle part might be better in the winter.\n\n(Mango puree) The first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  It was mango puree and a soda foam.  It was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.\n\n(Baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) This was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  The sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  As individual parts, this dessert was decent, but I did not really love it as a whole.\n\n(Madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  I liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  I wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  The chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.\n\nDespite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nPrices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  And because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.\n\nI thought the service at MIX was very good, but the food was about the same quality as Mandalay Bay's other lackluster fine dining spot Aureole.  There is a lot mediocre fine dining in Las Vegas and, unfortunately, Alain Ducasse's MIX falls in that bunch.  If you are looking for better and more contemporary French dining, you should check out L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand instead.\n\nThe Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking."

Expensive but well worth it. And the view from the top floor of Mandalay Bay... awesome. We sat outside on the patio too which was perfect. Everything we ordered was fabulous. We started with Kampachi sashimi, Bluefin tuna tartare, and Pork ribs appetizers. The sashimi was my fave. Then lobster and filet mignon for dinner. And ended with the Rum bread with Honey Vanilla Bean ice cream and Madeleines with Nutella. Yum, yum, yum. Oh yeah, even their bread basket was over the top with different types of breads and really good whipped butter. Mmmm"

Our seats were so close to the other tables we might as well have been on a double date! \n\nWe again asked for the tasting menu, but it wasn't the same. They had a set menu for V day.

You will be doing your business facing the strip on the 64th floor! (maybe do it at night, you might feel less exposed to the world even though no one will see you).\n\n2) FANTASTIC FOOD. I am really only going to mention the lobster served on top of coconut rice as it is one of the signature dishes of Alain Ducasse. Alain Ducasse is the first chef to own restaurants carrying three Michelin Stars in three cities. He's a pretty big name in europe and boy is there something really fantastic about his food. This dish sounds simple, but everything was cooked to perfection. I was afraid of an overpowering coconut flavor, but to my pleasant surprise it was perhaps the best coconut rice I have ever had. When I was done with the dish I REALLY wished I could pick it up and lick it clean. Truly finger-lickin-good. \n\n3) GREAT WINE: The wine selection was fantastic. Loved everything I had.\n\nI wont say much more other than, please try this place. It is certainly pricey at nearly $50 an entree, but it will be well worth the money. \n\n\n**TIP: you can get a restaurant.com coupon here."

Along the casino, we were not clear on where to go and even its employees were not clear on the instructions to find the restaurant.\n\nAs we approached the elevators, there were multiple confusing entrances without proper visual cues.   Once we found the elevator, it was evident that it was on the top floor.  The entrance was nice with clear art work which my daughter likens to bubbles.  \n\nThe view of the strip is expectedly nice and amazing once it was dark enough to be lighted.   Service was  good but I was not aware of the small dance floor or not.   I did not check out the bathrooms or any place after dinner.   \n\nCousins ordered foi gras and I think they loved it.  We also traded our entree and were equally impressed of the fish, gnocchi, steak, and crab dish.   I was enthralled with dessert and savoring the chocolate ice cream that was melting in my mouth.   We were also treated with freshly baked madeleines that were mixed with a slight hint of hazelnut.\n\nOur family was treated a to really nice family celebration (thanks Uncle) at the end of the trip.

            "review": "Ok.\n\nI've been waiting for a few days to write this review, so I could synthesize just how disappointing this meal was.\n\nMy company Christmas party was in Las Vegas this year.  My bosses are both big foodies and they'd been to Ducasse's restaurants before (in fact, one of my bosses had been to his two other Michelin star restaurants in Europe, so we had high hopes).  I cannot believe how shitty this place was.  Yes, I said shitty.\n\nFirst, we had made a reservation to sit at the chef's table.  There were 18 of us and we wanted to make sure that we could all sit together at one large table.  They split us up in groups of 9 (which is ridiculous, as we all had plus ones) and threw us into the main dining room.  When my boss took issue with this new seating arrangement with the hostess, she curtly replied \"well that's not my problem, sir.\"  If you're the hostess and your customer's pre-arranged seating gets mixed up, it is, in fact, your problem.  We decided not to talk to the manager about this because we didn't want people spitting in our food.\n\nSo we waited 20 minutes to have our initial drink orders taken.  Then 15 minutes later we got some bread.  During this whole waiting period our water was refilled to the very top of the glass at almost a comedic pace.  I know that's nitpicky, bu tit was rather hilarious in the moment.  We did the prix fixe menu, which you would think would be easy to keep track of, but I was brought the wrong dish for both courses.  The service mixed up our two tables consistently.  I had to stop the person delivering my entree and say \"I did not order this. Try the other table.\"  I was correct and someone at the other table ordered the fish. \n\nMy steak was fine, but the menu did not say it was a petite filet, and yet there it was.  I mean, it was good, but I was expecting a full filet, as that's how it was labeled on the menu.\n\nDessert was lovely, but the service was so horrible.  Our bill was over $3K for our entire table and it was some of the worst service I've ever encountered.  Sure, the restaurant looks nice and the view from the lounge is great (even though the Foundation Room at the Mandalay Bay has a better view and is basically attached to THE Hotel).  Just avoid this place.  Fluer is downstairs and from what I understand it is WAY better."

Have your cab driver drop you off at theHOTEL since the elevators to go up to the 64th floor where the restaurant is located is right when you walk in!\n\nThe minute that I stepped out of the elevator and approached the restaurant, I was taken back by the all white decorations. I love it! Absolutely sleek and chic. We were seated by the window. It's kinda weird how they have it so that your backs are to the windows but no big complaints there. It was nice to enjoy our meal and when we occasionally turn around, we were able to take in the view.\n\nThey started us off with a bread basket that includes 2 kinds of butter: sea salt & peanut. Now, I'm normally not a peanut butter fan but this was so good! It was creamy with a hint of sweetness. I would've been happy just eating bread with the peanut butter but wait! It doesn't stop here, it gets better!\n\nI ordered the filet mignon rossini w/ foie gras and my date ordered the rib-eye with asparagus as a side. Although I enjoyed the rib-eye, I believe the dish worth raving about is the filet mignon! It came with mashed potatoes. The filet was tender and juicy at the same time. The foie gras just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! I couldn't get enough. Prior to ordering we had ask the waitress for recommendations on red wine. She recommended the Syrah which went extremely well with our steaks.\n\nOur waitress was extremely soft spoken it was sometimes hard to hear her. I also felt the service was not as attentive as it could've been. The bus boy seems to be around our table more and was extremely friendly. I noticed he was conversing with other guests at other tables too. When he learned that we were on the trip for my birthday celebration, he got me a complimentary dessert which consisted of  sweet breads and nutella spread. So sweet of him! Aside from that, we also ordered the MIX candy bar which has coconut and lime sorbet. Totally worth it!!! The chocolate was sweet while the coconut filled made it a little crunchy. Perfect combination.\n\nAfter our dinner experience we went to the lounge and wanted to step outside to snap some photos. Since Mandalay Bay is all the way at the end of the strip, you are able to see the view of the whole strip from the lounge area. We were stopped and told that only those with bottle service could be outside. WHAT? Lame... \n\nOverall, MIX has given me such a good experience that I will be back next time and will tell my friends to give it a try!"

There are two parts of the restaurants. As soon as you get off the elevator, you will see a dance floor area by the right hand side, to the left it is a full service bar with booths, high table in between. It also has a patio area which will be great for the summer or late spring. As you walk in, you will see the hostess stand and that's the second, restaurant part. Everything is white in the restaurant, Tables are fairly small fitting a party of 2 perfectly. Along the side by the french windows, they have booth seating. \n\nAs requested in my reservation, we got a table by the window. it is a small round table, very intimate and cozy for two people. As soon as we sat down, the server came to us and gave us a full introduction of the menus and wine list. We came here on Christmas Eve so we ordered their prefixed menu. \n\nFor Appetizer we had the Seared Diver Scallops. It is golden on the outside, tender on the inside yet you can taste the freshness of the Scallops together with the a slightly taste of the herbs. For Entree, we got Fillet Mignon medium rare. It came just the way I like it. We also had a raw tuna dish but I don't remember the name exactly. One thing I do remember about that dish is the sauce they use, unlike other sushi place, they didn't give the standard wasabi and soy sauce, instead, they offer whipped egg white, vinegar and the olive oil. I was really impressed after I tried it. We got a small cake for desert, nothing really special about the cake and a specialty drink from the restaurant. \n\nI would say it is a good place for a romantic dinner, especially for those who are going to celebrate any special occasions. The service is good but it is definitely one of those places where you take your time and eat. We were there for about 2 and a half hours for a 4 course meal. It is a bit pricey too but with the view and the quality of the food, I think it is worth it."

The interior is beyond beautiful and it will probably go on my list of must-see venues for tourists to visit while they are here. \n\nImagine Voodoo Lounge at the Rio with  better views and incomparable 5 star menus. All of 5 of us tried the \"Classic\" tasting menu. \n\nClassic Tasting menu:  \n--Pre-Menu: A mouse, sooo good. It tastes like bacon but better. \n1. Potato Gnocchi with asparagus cream & pesto. AMAZING!! Everyone at the table agreed it was the best Gnocchi they had ever tasted. \n*** I added Tuna Tartare as well, it was tasty.***\n2. Lobster Curry. OMG, Imagine the best tasting indian dish you ever put in your mouth with a melt in your mouth buttery lobster! \n3.Filet w/ Foire Gras. Cooked PERFECTLY. So good!!\n--Passion Fruit Foamy Cocktail. I have no idea what the real name is, but it was a unique end to the meal. I will look forward to it again :)\n4. Baba cake. Not my fav... I would probably sub this out because I need chocolate. I am not subtracting any stars for this because the view made up for the Meh dessert, plus everyone else at the table loved it, \n--After Dessert: Vanilla Cookies, fresh with nutella. \n\nView: If I could Give a view 10 stars, I would!! It was amazing!! Make sure you use the club restroom so you can have a view even while you go ;) \n\nService: 10 Stars as well! Our server was very engaging an answered a ton of questions about the chandelier and history of the restaurant. \n\nI will be back!! Plan about $200 per person for Wine/Food for a nice meal :)"

Along the way a few well dressed young looking guys gave us passes to Mix telling us guys would get in for free.  We met up with everyone in the suite, got our drank on, and headed back down to the Mix.  Sure enough not only were the gals free, but the guys were too.  We then took an elevator ride back up to Mix...\n\n-the dance floor is relatively small\n-good mix of music to make you get up and dance\n-plenty of seating so it can be more of a lounge than an actual club\n-bartenders were heavy handed with the liquor (while I had a fun time that night, the following morning wasn't so fun).\n\nThe best part of the night was that everyone had a good time without having to pay a cover which meant extra cash for the strong dranks :)"

Consisitancy made it seem like they melted some cheese in heavy whipping cream, but went cheap on the quality ofcheese, the bits of ham were just weird.\ndrinks- green tea, surpisingly served at the right temperature and LOOSE leaf, no tea bags here, wait staff even told me to wait a few minutes for it to properly steep (brownie points), & Seirra Nevada, nice pairing with  steak for non vinophiles.\n2nd visit Still 5 stars. This time it was a toss up between lamb and braised wagyu. I got the wagyu on waiters suggestion, it tasted like pot roast, oh well. Steak was again perfect. I finally got to try the lemon verbana tea, excellent. The mix candy bar itself tasted like a freshly made kit kat, mixed with the lime sorbet, it becomes that perfect NYE kiss.

Walking in you can help but notice the beautiful, chandelier hanging, it's not hard to miss being as huge as it is. The view at the top of Mandalay Bay is just breathtaking, day or night. It has such a very romantic atmosphere with candles lit on all of the tables.  Our waiter was so very helpful, my husband and I are from a small town so him explaining exactly what was what on the menu and giving us his personal opinion was greatly appreciated, and his attitude toward us was awesome to say the least, he was so friendly. My husband ended up ordering just a beer to drink but I ordered a blue martini (can't remember the name now) but it was amazing! Perfect, with a cherry at the bottom! For dinner we each ordered the strip steak. I cannot begin to describe how juicy it was! Probably one of the best steaks that I've ever had! I'm sure my husband would say the same. The chef really does care about the people that come in to eat his fabulous food, while your in between waiting for your drinks and dinner he sends out taste testers which were also amazing. For desert, we ordered (with help from our fabulous waiter) Grandpa's Hat which is a chocolate covered souffle. The very special part of this amazing dessert was it was in the shape of a cowboy hat and had cherries that were soaked (and when I say soaked, I mean WOW) in bourbon inside the souffle and a couple on the plate with some cherry sauce. All in all, this place is amazing. I would recommend anyone try it at least once. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!"

Also,, we upgraded to the Vip seating for a spectacular view. Well, we were seated behind a pilar and waitstaff station. Everyone else were seated along the railing with views of the strip. We were seated behind them along the wall. While we had only the view of their tables and the wall we still had to pay the same price as them. We asked for another seat but were told that nothing else was available. Never again will I pay for anything like this. I will definitely advise people to stay away from here."

I ordered the ribeye steak with a side of mac and cheese and it was so delicious! My steak was cooked medium rare, just the way I like it. Some places overcook it, but that definitely wasn't the case this time. The other girls in my group ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The mushrooms very flavorful but there was nothing special about the mashed potatoes. I also ordered a pear martini, which was pretty tastey as well. I love everything about this place from the decor, to the food, the stunning view, and excellent service. Since I was there for my bachelorette dinner, our entire group were given madelines that were baked fresh from the oven. Of course it was extremely declious! I must say that this is one of my favorite restaurants on the strip! The entree prices were expensive but comparable to other fancy restaurants. Their cocktails were a little on the steep side though. My martini was $18! Yikes! lol"

I haven't really heard of the place before, but the restaurant is located in the 64th floor of Thehotel. \n\nUpon exiting the elevator, you'll enter and pass through the lounge and bar area first. The lounge area has nice outdoor seating which has an amazing view of the Vegas strip with the Luxor pyramid right outside. The dining area was towards the back which was very open and bright even with the dimmed lights. We were seated in the booth area where you can see the pretty Vegas lights outside if your seat was facing the window.\n\nThey brought us a mixed bread basket which had four different types of bread (mini French baguette, pimiento bread, a dinner roll, and I think the other one was just white bread) with butter and peanut butter (butter that has chunks of peanuts in it). I loved the pimiento bread with the regular butter, but the peanut butter was also really good. I just wished that the butter was a little bit softer or melted so it's more spreadable on the bread.\n\nWe skipped the appetizers since we were getting full from the bread basket, but they had a good and solid selection. We decided to save stomach real-estate for dessert.\n\nWe mainly ordered from the Alaine Ducasse Classics menu as the waiter has suggested since that's what they're mostly known for. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n*Roasted Main Lobster \"Au Curry\" - My boyfriend ordered this dish and I had a couple (ok, maybe a few) bites off his plate. It was so delicious! I really liked the coconut basmati rice that it came with. I was kinda jealous of his dish and wished I ordered the same thing. But I wanted to order something different so we can both try two things. They didn't skimp on the lobster portion and was actually very generous with it. He almost didn't finish the lobster because there were really big chunks. The lobster was cooked well and wasn't chewy. I just loved the flavor of the whole dish. I definitely recommend this dish if it's your first time here.\n\n*Atlantic Seabass - Although I enjoyed my bf's dish, I still enjoyed what I ordered. The fish was just fresh and so meaty that it was very filling. My dish came with asparagus, octopus, littleneck au gratin, and baby squid. The octopus, littleneck, and baby squid were cooked really well and wasn't chewy. I'm always worried about seafood being overcooked since they get difficult to eat once it does. The asparagus was probably the best asparagus I've had in awhile. I kinda wish there was some sort of carb with this dish, but I figured that they skipped that because it'll end up being too heavy. Nonetheless, it was a very satisfying meal.\n\n*Peach Melba - Mmmm soooooo good! We pretty much annihilated this dessert. It's a nice light dessert and a great way to end a good meal. \n\nThey also brought us complementary fresh Madeleines with nutella dipping sauce after we ate our dessert. So we were pretty glad that we didn't order a chocolate dessert. \n\nGreat ambiance. Friendly staff. Nice view. Highly recommended! I really enjoyed our dining experience here."

Once inside, you pass a small dance floor and head toward the back where the bar is crowned by a red reef-like structure a topped with fiber optic twinkling stars.

It feels like a hidden, out of the way oasis in the middle of the strip because it doesn't have a casino, the entry is from the garage for the Mandalay Bay and the place is just quiet and reserved.  The restaurant itself is striking, with views of the surrounding area and the minimalist decor making you feel like you are somewhere \"special\".  \n\nWhat's the problem here... yeah, I'm not talking about the food.  We didn't order everything on the menu, but I thought we ordered enough to get a good feeling of the overall foodie experience and it's just not that special.  We started with the charcuterie plate which had various cuts, but I've had much, much better.  We also ordered the gnocchi appetizers.  This was the best plate we had.  The gnocchi are light and airy and not too dense and the light sauce doesn't overpower the simple taste of the gnocchi.  Great on that one plating, but nothing else came close.   We ordered the boneless rib eye and it lacked juiciness, taste, everything.  They provided sauces with it... and the steak needed the sauces.  That shouldn't be the case with rib eye.  The sauces weren't that good either, they lacked any real flavor, just bland.  \n\nWe ordered various sides, the fries, the asparagus, the mushrooms and, again, nothing stood out.  Very disappointing, the food just didn't live up to the atmosphere."

Just as the restaurant, the view is breathtaking (64 floors up). I loved the fact that they had tables outside to enjoy the fresh air and the view. All the tables are open for everyone until about 10PM (or something like that) and then some of them are closed off for table service.\n\nHowever, there is still ample seating, which was a total plus for me. The bathroom was another crazy feature. I liked the fact that one of the stalls has a glass wall to the outside! It's like your doing your business on top of the world (or at least that's how it feels like). hahaha The one thing I didn't like about it was that it's very close to the men's bathroom and if you're not careful (and especially if you're drunk) you can walk into the wrong one (no doors to the bathrooms). Some guy was looking into the women's bathroom while a friend and I walked in. \n\nThe music was okay. The drinks were decent but the bartender was very quick to help us so we didn't have to wait too long. \n\nIt was fun but I was hoping we all would've gone somewhere else after a while.

We decided to go ahead with it, as we wanted to impress some out-of-state friends with the view and a (hopefully) fantastic meal. We were not disappointed. Even though we were about 15 minutes late checking in for our 9pm reservation (we had a hard time finding a parking space) and two of our party had not yet arrived, the hostesses were friendly and polite. They gave us the choice of being seated or waiting in the lounge. We chose to wait in the lounge, which had a fabulous view, and had a couple of delicious, yet pricey, drinks. Our friends didn't arrive until about 9:30, but we were seated promptly and waited on quickly. We did not have a strip view, but we didn't mind. The restaurant's decor was view enough for us, although we had a few very loud large parties seated nearby. Service was good throughout. We didn't ask many questions of our server, but she was friendly and polite. Our meal was served at a leisurely pace, which allowed us to catch up with each other.\n\nThe food: Delicious, yet very pricey. One of our dining companions, who is a wine afficicinado, commented that although they had quite a good selection, they were drastically overpriced. We ended up with a very nice Merlot ($160), however. \n\nWe each ordered appetizers, and my husband had the winner of the group, a spicy grilled shrimp salad with a tomato and cheese base. I had the potato and asparagus gnocci ($28), which was also very tasty. For entrees, I ordered the curry lobster ($59), which was absolutely heavenly! It was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of curry in a flavorful sauce. Just enough coconut rice to add a bit of starch to the dish. My husband liked his salmon ($39), but said it was a bit too rare for his taste (he ordered it medium). One friend had the veal, which she loved, and her husband also had the lobster. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the raspberry tirimisu($12), which was light, creamy, and delicious. It came served in a martini glass, which I thought was a nice touch. We also were given little vanilla muffins with a nutella/hazelnut/chocolate sauce, compliments of the chef. My husband and friends also had espresso, which they said was also very good, and I had a cup of coffee, which was also good. I found it interesting that we weren't given any sugar- only Splenda, Equal, and Sweet & Lo. I guess everyone who visits MIX is on a diet? \n\nAfter dinner, we went to the lounge, looked at the view, and danced a bit. Of course, the view was spectacular. The bathrooms in the lounge are quite an experience- a stall with a view! I don't think I'd enjoy it very much if I were any tipsier, however. As it was, I felt a little vertigo. After a few more dances in the lounge, we decided to call it a night. Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience. I was full, but not stuffed, and we had a leisurely meal with great friends."

I ordered the lobster ( for main course) when the food came out, first bite was too salty and nasty.. I gave to my friends to taste it.. they all agree that I need to let the server know about it.\n\nthe server, she was very kind to re-made it for me( i think it should be that's way because of I paid for $50  for that.) no matter what the food was re-made but still not good as you paid for $50.\n\nGood experience but not worth for money, if you are going to spend $2000 per table.."

We are used to paying $$$$ for dinner and expected some outstanding food. The Amuse Bouche and Lobster Martini were disgusting. The dinner was to include wine. Our waiter didn't seem to know this so the champagne came before the Amuse Bouche and by the time it arrived she was serving another wine. She also didn't seem to know what wine went with what. She tried to serve me the dessert wine with the beef. The table was what was promised right by a window; however, in order to see the fireworks we had to go outside and push our way out through everyone else who had paid less for a table because it was not by a window. The fireworks were spectacular!!"

Only wish there was a bit more curry sauce with the lobster.  The sides of asparagus and mac and cheese were also pretty good but the mac was a little out of place with the rest of the classic French menu.  An experiment in trying to mix classic French with casual American within the meal was not successful but each dish was tasty on its own.\n\nI'd stick to going with one or the other for the entire meal."

But that's not why you're there.   You're there for the view.   It's incredible. .. it's memorable. .. it reminds me of the Signature Lounge on the 96th Floor of the John Hancock in Chicago.   That view is higher and the setting more refined,  and allows you to enjoy a panoramic view of Chicago and watch the planes landing in one of the busiest airports in the world like fireflies from 20 miles away.  But the view from Mix is perhaps more spectacular because you get a biredseye view of the entire Vegas Strip... and,  you can enjoy it outside on the deck when the weather isn't too hot.   \nThe bar has a very cool, techy vibe with lots of up lighting and really cool lighted menus.   But it's not really what I'd call a comfortable place to hangout with friends.   It's not comfortable and neither is the seating.   But it is a great place to start or end the evening with a drink or two to take it all in."

It's not really the 64th floor, as the elevator skips a few numbers, but it is still a breathtaking view.  It is top notch in terms of dining and blew our hero's expectations away, even after reading its already spectacular Yelp reviews.  The modern lounge area is also very classy and has an amazing view of the Vegas strip from the south end.  This is definitely an excellent choice for wining and dining, and some low key drinks and dancing in a smaller lounge environment.\n\nAfter ordering, our hero was presented with an amuse-bouche of lobster cocktail in a martini glass that was pleasant and well balanced between seafood and gazpacho flavors.  His main course of wagyu beef with vegetables in a pot was astounding: it flaked apart with just a fork and was so soft that it could be crushed between his tongue and the roof of the mouth without chewing.  Complimentary madelines with Nutella spread before the check were also a nice sweet touch from the chef as well.\n\nThis really is a restaurant that deserves its Michelin star and serves food at a price point that is affordable to any degenerate gambler that just won a spin of the roulette wheel at Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe lounge side of MIX is separated from the restaurant by a transparent glass enclosed kitchen.  It can also be accessed by a special elevator on the ground floor guarded by bouncers.  A small dance floor, narrow floor plan, and division of the lounge by a partitioning bar gives a feeling of privacy as opposed to large spread-out lounges.  There's also bottle service tables and a viewing area on the patio where our hero had a great photo-op of the strip.  The view alone is reason enough to visit MIX at night!\n\nPROS:\n- The view from 20-something floors up.  Even the windows at the urinals in the men's washrooms had a nice view!\n- One of the best dining experiences of my life.  No joke.\n- Friendly and attentive service.\n- Cool modern decor.\n\nCONS:\n- The bread is somewhat bland and not even warm, and the butter is too hard to spread.\n- Tables along the windows seem packed together fairly close and the noise level is a bit high such that you can hear your neighbors' conversations clearly."

The perfect blend of cheese,cream, and crunchy toppings!\n-LAST but NOT certainly least..........ta da CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with pistachio ice cream.

If price were not taken into account, I would give this place slightly below 3 stars for the quality of food.  But for the thermospheric prices ($50/entree), I had expected excellent, if not indelibly memorable food.  Instead, the food was just adequate.  So I knocked off 2 stars because of the poor price/quality ratio.\n\nNot everything about this place was bad.  The dining room was very nicely done.  It definitely had the trendy Vegas/LA see/be seen thing going on.  The waiters were also very helpful.  Ours knew the intricacies of every dish and spoke like a food critic, using words like \"acidity\" and \"overtones\".  We got excited just listening to him talk about the dishes.\n\nBut then the food came.  The first course was actually decent.  I ordered the prawns appetizer, which had excellent crustacean flavor, but not quite worth the $28.  My girlfriend had the gnocchi, which was good, but again, not spectacular.  For the entree, I ordered the bison.  Again, a decent piece of meat, but nothing memorable.  The peppercorn crust was far too heavy, which made me think that the chef was trying to mask the dull flavor of the underlying meat.  My girlfriend had the lobster au curry ($58), which is supposedly one of Alain Ducasse's signature dishes.  The lobster was cooked perfectly, but the sauce did nothing to enhance the flavor of the lobster, which left the dish tasting limp.  \n\nWhile we were pretending to enjoy our entrees, the waiter came by to remind us that both were written up in magazines (Bon Apetit I think he said).  As if suggestion was going to make the entrees taste better.  Had the dishes verged on greatness, we might have been convinced.  But that was clearly not the case."

            "review": "In sum -- good food overall, but a bit inconsistent. Some dishes were absolute standouts (the lobster au curry is one of the best things I've ever eaten), but some big misses as well. Service was excellent, and the view (from the top floor of the Delano, formerly THEhotel at Mandalay Bay) is beautiful.\n\nI did the signature tasting menu ($120), which has four courses, and my husband did the Taste of Mix tasting menu ($90) which has five.  They have completely different dishes, so we got to share and try a lot of stuff.  I also really wanted the chocolate souffle for dessert and they were kind enough to sub this in for the dessert on my tasting menu at no extra charge.  Great service!  \n\nThe portions on the tasting menu are huge for a tasting, so come hungry and pace yourself.\n\nThe bread basket had 4 different kinds of bread, and we were given two of each.  It was good but not great.  Their homemade peanut butter was the most memorable part of the bread & butter.  \n\nThe amuse of smoked salmon-infused cheese & potato chip was yummy.\n\nMy first course was the gnocchi with peas and mushrooms.  This course was a big miss for me.  The gnocchi were mushy and the sauce did nothing for the dish.  \n\nFortunately my second course was the lobster au curry, which was absolutely amazing.  Big chunks of tender lobster meat served atop an absolutely delicious curry sauce and the creamiest coconut rice I've ever had, all topped with little crunchy things (super helpful description, I know, I'm just not sure what they were) that gave the dish great texture.  This was so, so, so good.\n\nMy third course was the filet mignon topped with foie and black truffles.  Oof, it was so rich I could hardly eat it but it was also so good.  Obviously the foie and black truffles were fantastic additions, but the filet itself was perfection and just melted in my mouth.  \n\nThere's a \"palate cleanser\" before the dessert course, but it's not the tiny shot you normally get, it's a full-size pina colada served in a normal martini glass.\n\nThe chocolate souffle was not great, but also not the worst one I had this weekend (that \"honor\" goes to Joel Robuchon).  The flavor of the souffle itself was lacking, but it had a ribbon of chocolate sauce near the bottom that provided some much-needed chocolate flavor.  The pistachio ice cream that came with it tasted homemade and was great.\n\nMy husband did the other tasting menu which had five courses: 1) dungeness crab salad, 2) foie gras, 3) seared scallops, 4) lamb loin and 5) Mix candy bar (homemade candy bar with chocolate, peanut butter and graham cracker) for dessert.  I sampled most of these and they were all pretty good but I didn't like them as much as my dishes overall (admittedly, my menu was more to my particular tastes).  We both thought it was strange that the foie was served just by itself and not on top of bread as it is normally.  It's a little too rich without the bread.\n\nWe were both stuffed by the dessert course and asked for most of our desserts to go.  Shockingly (sarcasm in case you can't tell), they agreed to box it up for us like a normal restaurant and didn't refuse like another fancypants place.  Our waiter saw the busboy taking away our mostly untouched desserts and asked with great concern if there was something wrong and if he could bring us something else on the house.  We explained that we were just full, but I very much appreciated the attentive service.  We didn't get mignardises, probably because we hardly touched our desserts (which is fair, I understand they don't want to waste food), but it would have been a nice touch if they'd boxed these up to go too.\n\nThe view from the restaurant is really nice, with a great view of both the strip and the mountains in the distance.  After dinner, they invite you to go to the lounge if you'd like, which I understand would otherwise have a cover charge.  The dining room is really pretty (nice decorations inside, and a lovely outdoor area as well), but it felt a little weird eating there because it was almost totally empty at peak dinner time of 7-9 pm.  It was Sunday though, which is probably their slowest night.  \n\nThis doesn't compare to Picasso (my favorite fine dining in Vegas), but it was definitely a good meal and I'm glad we came.  If you come here, you MUST order the lobster curry."

We were 6 people in our group and we were all planning to order drinks but they still didn't let us enter the patio. They insisted for us to pay 100 dollar to enter the patio which by the way was full of smokers. No thanks. I'm willing to pay for drinks in a nice bar but I'm not willing to pay 100 for a view of the Vegas strip. I can go to stratosphere, high roller or paris for a better view of the strip and the price would be cheaper and I wouldn't deal with smokers."

While the views and the interior of the restaurant were amazing, the food and service left much to be desired.  To begin with, the hostess didn't ask if we'd prefer to sit inside or outside.  We ended up sitting outside...the heat and the altitude began to make us all feel nauseated.  I also made the mistake of wearing heels to the restaurant...the floor of the patio was like a deck and my heel kept getting stuck in the floor.  Also, every time someone walked by the table, it felt like the floor was shaking (wish I would have known to bring dramamine to dinner).  When the waiter came to our table he asked if we had a show to attend.  We should have said yes as this might have lead to quicker service.  We ended up not ordering wine or cocktails for the table (due to the nausea), and the waiter seemed to write our table off.  After we placed our food order, it took an hour for dinner to come.  While the food (when it did come) wasn't terrible, it definitely wasn't worth the $90/person we ended up spending.  The waiter didn't come to check on us at all throughout the meal.  He even spent 20 minutes flirting with some girls at the table next to us while we were waiting for our bill.  When we complained to the manager at the end of the meal, he asked why we didn't come speak with him since he was outside the whole time.  I don't know about your experiences, but in other restaurants, the manager usually circulates and checks on each table themselves rather than waiting for diners to come up to them.  One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  I will definitely not be going back to Mix."

The decor is simple yet unique and kinda spacey (if that works). There is a swirley staircase in the middle of the restaurant and the color of everything is all white making it appear very clean and elegant. The restaurant is surrounded by windows and has a great view of Vegas. There are strings of glassy-like bubbles around the room which looked pretty cool - very different. The one thing that stood out was the service. The service was outstanding and exceptional. They were very attentive to what you needed and ordered. I felt like a queen and was treated very well for such a place. The food on the other hand was a little different for me, but none the less it was a new experience in fine dining and was fairly tasty. The price however was a little much. For 4 people we ended the night with a $400 bill. I guess that's not that bad compared to some places, but you know how it goes. I had the beef sirloin which was pretty tender and tasty, except I was very fond of the sauce. The potatoes that came with it were differnet but bland. My boyfriend had ordered the snapper which was really tender and tasty. Our friends ordered the halibut which was very fresh and tender/tasty as well along with the bison which was something different to see on the menu. That as well was extreeememely tender and different. For appetizer we had the tuna tartar (which was my fav to eat with the variety bread basket) and the spricy crab salad which wasn't spicy at all and not very tasty to me. However, the desserts were very pretty but not so tasty. We had the apricot dessert which wasn't my favorite because the apricots were soooo sour it made your face look funny. the pistachio ice cream it came with was very good though. Our friends had the chocolate dome was looked tasty but I didn't try it because of the peanuts (allergy). the BEST part of the meal was the finishing touches of the MADELINES. the MADELINES were sooooo goooooooood. They were freshly baked and warm right out of the oven and served with a little bit of warm chocolate sauce served on the side. If I could, I would've ate a ton of them instead of ordering the apricot dessert. I'd go back just for the madelines (seriously, no joke!).\nI think overall it was a very nice dinner to end our Vegas trip and the service made it great.. the madelines made it even better. LOL."

In the past the food was not exceptional. This time the food was very good (we also just noticed a 1-star Michelin rating, not sure if that is new). Most noteworthy was the incredible service and the friendly staff. Literally everyone had a smile on their face and was off the chart friendly. Our dining experience was 5-star worthy. Hopefully it wasn't a one-day fluke."

We finally sat down for dinner and noticed how poor the service was, especially for a fine establishment that has won numerous Michelin awards.  I ordered the halibut with foie gras, I've had better.  My friend ordered the NY strip, it was good but again we've had better.  My other friend ordered I think the cod or sea bass, can't remember and she said it was ok.   All in all the food was mediocre.  The views are amazing and the lounge next door was fun.\n\nAte at Aureole a few nights later and thought the meal I had there was the best in Vegas, I'll definitely go back there for the same price I paid at Mix."

Best to get there early before the little 30somethings arrive. I had worked with the kitchen a few weeks before, selected 9-10 apps and desserts to be passed by servers, with a hosted bar for all drinks. \n\nFirst, the service was impeccable. 3 girls, very pretty and super friendly, along with a nice and knowledgeable guy behind the bar. Food came out at a very reasonable pace, and no one went hungry. \n\nSecond, food was amazing. Highlights included black sesame tenderloin beef on mini-skewer, and Ducasse's stunning shrimp cocktail with horseradish panna cotta. Really delightful, flavorful and perfectly executed. Nothing was old, wilty or less than perfect. \n\nThird, amazing pricing. 2 grand for food, liquor and views for 25 people. Couldn't do better if I cooked the stuff myself and rented a suite. \n\nThe secret is to pick the earlier hour, before the disco dollies have even left the pool, and be kind to all the service people you meet there. Attitude begets attitude, and believe me these workers see a lot of it in Vegas. Hopefully the club kids will all flock off to the Palms or some other MTV-like horror and leave this place alone. \n\nSome of the best food and service I've seen in Vegas, and a view that can't be matched. Highly recommended."

Service was a mixed bag... the assistants were great, always keeping our waters filled and tending to us.  Our waitress was snobby and rude.  We had a party of four and she treated us like third class customers.. when I asked about the two different types of filet mignon, and didn't particularly like one of them, she decided herself to put me down for the other filet mignon and asked how I want it cooked.  I couldn't order myself?? Or decide on something I wanted?? I just asked a question about the menu, not that I wanted one or the other.  She seldom made an appearance after our order, but made our experience worse each time she did.\n\nThe food was decent, but overpriced for the quality.  Good thing for the Restaurant.com $50 off certificate or this would be a 1 star review.  And using the certificate was a pain, they made you jump through many hoops because their system was \"down\".\n\nWe hit Gordan Ramsay Steak the next day and were treated to how a fine dining restaurant is supposed to be:  Waiters and assistants buzzing around constantly helping or answering questions and not turning their nose up at you.  Take notes, Mix.\n\nMix is an awesome location with a great view and sky high potential.  Too bad we were not worthy clients to be treated to a nice dinner.\n\nAnd ladies, if you're going to use the restroom at Mix and are afraid of heights, be warned.. the toilet faces a floor to ceiling glass window with a 60+ floor view to the ground.. terrifying if you don't like heights."

I would have preferred ahi and avocado instead of the cucumber with curry flavoring. \n\nThe lobster curry was good but not amazing. The pieces of lobster were large, but the curry sauce and the rice were not too impressive.  Personally, I don't think the two go together.\n\nThe filet with foie gras and black truffle was yummy! Too bad my first steak was way overcooked.  They were nice enough to take it back and prepare another one for me, and they even gave me a new side of potatoes which I thought was a nice gesture.  The 2nd one was cooked perfectly, but I felt like half the piece was really good and tender and the other half had a lot of gristle and was a little tough to eat. Guess I had bad luck with the piece I got. =\\\n\nThe sorbet was a nice way to end the meal.  Overall, MIX is still one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.

Service was Satisfactory but it was clear waitstaff was serving too many tables.\n\nHad the foie gras with truffles.   It tasted rancid.  Waitstaff wasn't around to discuss so demurred to next course.  Had the barramundi with veggies.   Fish was ok, not spectacular, but vegetables were so heavily salted to be inedible.  Wife's main course was similarly poor.  At this point it was clear that something was very, very wrong here.  We skipped dessert & wine as we really weren't enjoying the food.  When they brought out the Madeleines at the end of the meal we simply refused them.  \n\nThe tell was that the waiter never asked us how our food was.  Obviously, he knew there was a problem in the kitchen.  I slashed his tip to 5% for that - if he didn't care, neither would I.\n\nMix was the biggest fine dining dissapointment I have had in years.  I certainly wouldn't want my name associated with this restaurant if I was chef.   Don't even waste your time or money."

            "review": "I have dined at Mix many times with a friend of mine and loved it, so we suggested it for our mutual friend's birthday extravaganza. The evening did not start out as intended. First, you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the hostess podium, why they hide it is beyond me as it makes perfect sense to have it out front and visible. After we checked in, we were seated in the middle of the dining room. Every other diner in the restaurant was seated with a view of the strip so we thought that was a little odd. Sure, we are young, but we were going to spend plenty of money considering the price of the entrees! So we asked to be reseated, since it was my friend's birthday we were hoping for a seat with a view, I mean that is the allure of Mix. We were immediately seated in a corner in front of the hostess podium, with a view of the Southwest, ummm OK? So we asked if we could sit outside instead. The hostess begrudgingly lead us outside and sat us in the far corner of the balcony, with a beautiful view of the airport. This seemed very passive aggressive to me and that belief was validated as she whispered into our waiters ear for a good few minutes, not even trying to hide the fact that she was clearly talking about us. We seriously almost got up and left, as there are plenty of other fabulous dining options in Mandalay Bay. Now, I agree that we may have been a pain, but the restaurant was nearly empty and there were plenty of tables open on the balcony the entire time we dined, so it was not like the place was packed and we were demanding a specific seat. Also, the strip celebrated Earth hour, so it was really cool to see all the lights go out on the strip, of course we had to stand and peer over the railing since we were still in a corner, but we definitely enjoyed the view. Overall, this was really a sour start to what was supposed to be a fun evening.\n\nThe food at Mix never disappoints and it shouldn't for the price. You always start out with a selection of fresh baked breads, so many delicious choices it's hard not to fill up. I always get the braised Wagyu beef and I am always happy with it. It is served in a cute little pot with a delicious braising sauce, carrots, mushrooms, and pearl onions. It is fork tender and a nice size for the price. I shared a bite with everyone and they were all very jealous! I also tried a bite of my husband's ribeye and my friend's venison, which were both delicious. We always get a side of mac and cheese with ham, which is always a creamy and delicious winner. We tried the fries as well, they had a weird seasoning on them, but worked when I dipped them in the Wagyu gravy. They also serve a complimentary Madeleine pastry at the end of the meal, which is lemony and delicious. I definitely appreciated that they brought them out with a happy birthday plate and a side of Nutella for our friend, it was the least they could do after how we were initially treated. \n\nOverall, I love Mix, but will think twice after this debacle. They have a fabulous view and fantastic food, but nobody likes a pretentious and unfriendly start to their meal. Our evening would have been 100% better if it had started with a smile and a warm greeting, nobody likes to feel like a pain, change the attitude Mix and you will have a packed house every night. It seriously pains me to give you 3 stars since I truly believe that the food is 4 star, but I can't ignore how we were treated."

Although we were very pleased with the ambiance and the spectacular view, no other part of the evening was pleasant.\n\nThe four of us dressed appropriately for the restaurant per their \"dressy\" description but when a table of about a dozen younger, we'll call them \"boys\" showed up in jeans and undershirts we were a bit taken aback.  If you are going to advertise that you are a \"dressy\" establishment you should stand by that standard.  But the boys attire was the least of our concerns.  A couple of them were obviously inebriated and at one point one of them excused himself to, and I apologize for the choice of words, but vomit.  When he came back to the table he was no better than when he left.  He could barely sit in his chair or keep his head up straight.  By this time we noticed that management was \"standing by\" but they took no action to ask the boys to excuse their friend from the establishment.  Their hesitation in doing so resulted in the same boy getting up from the table once again and not quite making it to the restroom this time... he vomited right there at the hostess area.  Although it appeared one table found this amusing, we did not.  And we were not the only ones.  My boyfriend did the right thing and approached the manager to inquire on why they didn't take action sooner so as to avoid this scene and he was told \"they have protocol\".  Apparently their protocol involves allowing their guests to vomit at will.  My boyfriend was also told that since the boys were guests of the hotel they did not wish to ask them to leave.  I'm sorry, were WE not guests of the hotel?  And not only were we guests of the hotel but we were staying in their 2,000 sq ft media suite so we weren't just you average joe-schmos trying to act like we were \"somebodies\" or try to get something from them.  The manager made no apology to my boyfriend about the incident and instead gave him the attitude of \"what do you expect us to do\".  His attitude toward the situation was completely unprofessional and inexcusable.  \n\nNow, aside from the unexpected show that came with dinner, the food itself was absolutely terrible.  We were served a basket of mixed breads which weren't even warm, in fact their temperature was more of that they were just pulled out of the refrigerator.  We ordered the gnocchi and tuna tartare for appetizers and they were just okay.  For our main entrees my best friend and I ordered the Lobster \"Au Curry\".  It was over cooked and chewy not to mention it looked like the chef had just found remnants of a lobster and threw them on the plate.  I shouldn't have to chew my lobster like its beef jerky.  In fact I'm pretty sure I've had beef jerky that has been more tender.   My boyfriend had the Sea Bass and it was completely flavorless and overcooked.  We also ordered two sides of the macaroni and cheese which was also completely overcooked.  Kraft macaroni and cheese is better than what they served us.  For a meal that was going to cost us close to $500 (they were gracious enough to comp us due to the fact that our appetites were lost since having to witness the vomiting - but don't worry, we tipped the server generously as this incident was no reflection on him) we were nothing short of disappointed and I think that's being kind.  In all honesty, I wouldn't even pay $25 for the meal we had.\n\nMy advice - go somewhere else. There are too many other wonderful restaurants in Vegas to have to suffer through this one."

Located at the top floor of the Mandalay Casino tower perched just above the Luxor's diamond in the sky you get an absolutely breath taking view of the city lights. The ambiance and decor are quite lovely and Really, that's all ya get. \n\nThe DJ is hit or miss ( I really wanted to ask the DJ if it was part of the job to keep the dance floor clean & clear and under control,) the crowd consisted of middle/late aged middle class white folk and the bartenders are slow, lack personality and don't even have their looks to fall back on. Drinks were so-so, nothing worth the $15.00 for a rum & redbull. Prepare to be robbed blind.\n\nGranted it was a Wednesday night, but I was under the impression that Vegas was on point 24/7. Perhaps they didn't get the memo.\n\n3 stars for great locale/concept but the execution/promotion could use some help.\n\nOur group arrived with 4men & 2women and we brought the party."

We have been to the lounge before, it was fun, and the dining experience this time was even better! \n\nThe elevator to Mix restaurant and lounge was scary, it was meant for dining people to see some amazing views on the way up, too bad I am scared of height. Passed through Mix lounge, lovely host girl let us choose a window booth or a bird nest booth, was it a bird nest? Or half egg shell? Either one I guess, I liked the bird nest, it was more private, comfy and fun.\n\nWe brought our own Perrier JOU\u00cbT champagne, our server put it in the ice to cool it down. I ordered a raspberry lemon drop martini to sip on while we were looking through the menu, very clean and simple menu, I could tell every single item on the menu must be so good. And I was right, the dishes we tried were AMAZING! \n\nStarters: \nComplimentary bread basket: assorted breads with butter and peanut butter, very delicious, loved the peanut butter! \n\nShrimp cocktail: non traditional shrimp cocktail, it was like a salad, jumbo shrimps were so fresh and tender, they tasted so good with the tomato sauce on the bottom, the sauce was so flavorful and delicious! \n\nBroccoli soup: clean flavor, with a hint of cheese in it, it was yummy. \n\nEntrees:\nLobster curry: one of their signature dishes, our server's favorite, he said he didn't even like curry, neither am I, but the curry flavor was fantastic! It was not heavy, just rich and flavorful, small amount of coconut to add a hint of spice, tender lobster meat with exotic flavors, it was MAGICAL, I loved it so much! \n\nFilet mignon with jalape\u00f1o pepper: the first cut came out overcooked to medium, they changed another one for hubby, the second one was a perfect medium rare, bloody and juicy, exactly what hubby liked. The red wine sauce was so good, the jalape\u00f1o was extremely spicy, server said it was from Santa Monica, most of them aren't spicy, guess hubby just got lucky to have a super spicy one on his plate, but both of us love spicy flavor, we didn't mind. Hubby loved his steak so much. \n\nSaut\u00e9ed mushrooms: with housemade creamy sauce, delicious mushrooms, the flavors were so strong. \n\nFrom appetizers to entrees, the food was amazing! The flavors were heavenly delicious! Chef worked magical exotic flavors on each dish, how did he do that?! Just WOW!\n\nDrinks:\nOur Perrier champagne was so tasty, loved it, the raspberry lemon drop was strong and yummy, Chef's complimentary coconut and passion fruit souffl\u00e9 was very very tasty, I usually don't like coconut flavor, what happened that night, how did I come to like curry and coconut flavors? \n\nAfter so much rich and flavorful food, I had no room for desert, the portions were big, both hubby and I got so full. Chef made us mini cakes with hot fudge as a little treat, just to apologize for overcooking hubby's steak, they were yummy. Hubby had double shot of espresso to finish this lovely dinner, I had the rest of the champagne by myself as usual. \n\nDefinitely one of the best dining experience I have ever had for a very long time! The restaurant was beautiful, the views were amazing, the food was spectacular, the service was flawless, it was just PERFECT! Worth every penny of the $300 tab! The cork fee was $35. \n\nMix has just become one my favorite restaurants in Vegas, along with Comme Ca and Circo. I think I've just had my next Vegas trip dinner dates lined up, that's awesome! \n\nPs. The lounge next door offers champagne bottle service on the patio, it's a great place to enjoy the night views of Las Vegas while sipping on champagne, very romantic and relaxing."

We ordered wine recommended by their sommelier and it was perfect. The drinks were a bit pricey but it's Vegas so what do you expect.

We found that the wine paring as well as the timing and order of the courses to be just perfect. The portions of each course did not seem very large, but somehow, it really fills you up! We were barely able to walk out after the meal! \n\nThe price may be high, but for what you get, it is definitely worth it.

You walk through the dark black and red lounge into the uber-modern, all white, all open dining space littered with tables. Beautiful, yes, but a place you can settle in for a relaxing, private meal? Definitely not.\n\nLas Vegas is all about spectacle, and Mix definitely has that. But everything from the doorstop of a wine menu to the 18 different servers who hover over you as you eat discourages complete enjoyment. You're so busy trying not to look un-chic that you forget to have fun.\n\nAnd the food--excellent, no question. I had the curried lobster and my fella had the bison tenderloin. The portions were small but impeccably cooked and flavored. The bison was so tender, it made me angry at every other steak I'd ever had. The prices are quite high, even for Vegas. The cocktail list is all sweet, flavored vodka drinks--they want you to drink wine anyway.\n\nBottom line--great food overwhelmed by a snooty vibe and personality-less service."

There's a restaurant and also a lounge.  \nFirst, I have to admit that I am not a fan of Las Vegas.  I don't gamble.  Can't stand the casinos and the all you can eat buffets and the people it attracts (not meant to offend anyone, sorry!).\nCame here for the weekend with a couple of great friends of mine for a quick getaway.  We wanted a place for light appetizers, cocktails and then dance.  Well Mix was the place for us.\nIt was convenient since we were staying at the Mandalay Bay which is adjacent to The Hotel, where Mix is located.\nWe got free admission passes walking through the casino to Mix.  Score!  When we got to the top of the 64th and exited the elevator, the view was just breath taking.  Awesome view of the Las Vegas strip with all the neon lights and nightlife below.  You can also step outside to the patio to take in the spectacular view.  But since I'm afraid of heights, I passed.\nSome of the specialty drinks were half price, taking it down to $8-9 / drink!  Score!  But by the end of the evening, we had 12 cocktails between the 3 of us.  So we were feeling no pain when we got the bill.\nFor appetizers we ordered 2 orders of the short rib slammers, crab mango salad (which was recommended) and ahi tuna stack tacos.  All 3 appetizers were awesome.  \nAfter we got sauced up a bit, we hit the dance floor, which is on the smaller side.  But it was still fun.  The DJ played some 80s and some disco tunes which brought more people to the dance floor, which was a blast.  But then when the techno rap stuff started, then the floor cleared. We asked him to play the B52s \"Love Shack\", but said he already did the 80s earlier.  After tipping the DJ $20, he played our request!  You would think since the B52s were playing the following night at the Mandalay Bay Beach that he would've obliged to play our request without the $20 tip! Geez!\nAnyway, it was a fun night out dancing.  And the B52s and Blondie concert the following night was awesome!"

We chose MIX based on the previous yelper's reviews, their chef, and multitude of previous favorable foodie reviews.   If it wasn't for all the amazing views, I would have rated this 1 star. \n\nDespite making our reservation over 2 months ago, we some how ended up in the corner seat next to the fake bamboo with no view, even though there we asked to be seated at a table with a view.  Apparently, those tables were \"reserved\".   Funny, I thought I had a reservation. \n\nThe very first words out of our waiter's mouth were not something like: \"Hello, my name is X, welcome to Mix\".  Instead, they were:  \" Hello folks, I'm sure you know our chef was recently rated best in the world.\"  followed by a soliliquy bragging of the place's rave reviews.  \n\nLong story short: The food was no better here than at a standard resort casino cafe. 2 of us ordered the lobster, 1 chicken, and 1 \"The Perfect Bite\" steak dish.  The two who ordered the lobster actually sent it back, YES, that's right I said it: The best chef in the world had 2 lobster dishes sent back to him.  It was hard, rubbery, cooked incorrectly, and tasted stale drenched in a butter curry sauce. Chicken was not even all that great.  And being from Chicago, the steak had nothing on any one of the steak joints you would find in downtown Chicago.  Also ordered 6 appetizers including 2- $24 vegetable cookpots which tasted like bagged frozen veggies - presented well in a ramekin dish.   Desserts?  Oh yeah, we ordered them but I honestly cannot remember what they were, so they must have been nothing to write home about. \n\nSome guy with a fake french accent came over after we sent back the lobster dishes; apparently annoyed, and asked if we wanted to try anything more.  Ummmm... no thanks, especially if it tastes like that!  \n\nI will share with you something good-   When you use the urinal in the men's room, there is a fantastic view of Mandalay Bay to keep you occupied while you relieve yourself.  \n\nI should have spent more time in the bathroom, perhaps I would have had a better experience."

With a Mix pass, our guys paid only $10 cover, while ladies are, of course, free.  \n\nWhen asking the bouncers for the lounge's specialty drink, they argued back and forth between the Melon and Apple Martini as a favorite.  I leaned towards the Apple Martini - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zOprLTFP3JhFQemMcVWeg?select=XOkF6l81z-tuyhZUr5Rbgg, which was strong with a deliciously puckering sour apple taste.  $13 for a cocktail, which is not too bad for Vegas.  The lounge was fairly spacious size with plenty of comfy booths- all facing the glass wall with the Strip's fabulous view.  The dance floor isn't the largest, but it wasn't super packed that night - just how I like it.  Music blasted some hip hop with R&B thrown in (Biggie, J. Hudson, Diddy, etc).  I had a great time here!  Just be sure to beat the crowds swarming the elevator at around 2am, the bewitching hour when the Vegas visitors get restless for a change in clubbing scenery."

No JT, but Mix Lounge was a surprising treat in itself. The bar was beautifully designed, with a reddish roof to it. The outdoor patio offered second-to-none views of the entire Strip. There was also a small dance floor with a decent DJ. The place never got too crowded, which was a nice surprise for Labor Day weekend. Another creative edge that Mix offered were the restrooms! Where else can you pee and see the entire Vegas Strip through a floor to ceiling window? I'd love to come back here again!"

Everything is white and it looks like something out of a movie.  They have these cascading bubbles when you enter.  The whole place is just so beautifully decorated that you just have to take pictures of this restaurant.  \n\nThe breads they give out here are amazing.  I especially loved the fruit bread...you just have to take my word for it.  Just don't get full off of it! I ordered the halibut.  It was wonderful, but a little on the salty side.  I had a piece of my friend's roasted chicken, and I do say, that was amazing!  The skin was cooked to perfection.  Next time, if I do come again, I'm definitely ordering that.\n\nThey also have lobster, lamb, and other tasty items.  Even the restroom was modern and hip.  It had the sink against a long mirror.  The toilets were located across from it.  Small, but tastefully done.  \n\nThe food here is great, and the view is just to die for.  The place gets packed, so definitely make reservations.  Definitely one of the nicest restaurants I've been to in my life."

But no clue how it got one.\n\nFood:\n- Appetizers: We ordered several different ones and thought they were all amazing\n- Entrees: most of us ordered a $75 filet + fois gras + truffle special.  The filet had absolutely no flavor.  You can see the large slice of fois gras & truffle on top, but neither had the distinct taste/flavor you would expect from such ingredients.  With those ingredients, it was so disappointing that it was so flavorless.\n- Sides: We had a couple orders of mac & cheese and veggies, and they were all good\n- Dessert:  Decent\n\nService: So annoying.  I don't know if just assumed that a group of guys meant we were on a bachelor party or something, but we weren't college kids on spring break or anything.

No clue, I'm talking about the lounge/club.\n\nFirst, it wasn't very busy when we went on a Friday night, and the people who were there looked like they were not having any fun either. They probably got recruited by the various Mandalay Bay properties like the restaurants that promise you free cover if you bring the receipt, or the solicitors on the main floor handing out cards also offering free cover. Well no shit there's free cover, there isn't anybody inside! One of the staff approached us and offered us bottle service for a deal (forget the price) so we accepted, why the hell not it was cheaper than buying at the bar. We had our own little sitting area that was completely empty. This dude acted like he was doing us the biggest favour in the world to be sitting there. He later sends us some girls over who are just looking to get some free drinks from us. They were beautiful, sure, but seriously? I know it's Vegas and everything but come on! We shooed them away and off they went to the only other table in our area with people at it, who were hooting and hollering them over. They chatted with the guys, got their free drinks, then took off making out with various random dudes and getting free drinks along the way. Then off they vanished never to be seen again... The end.\n\nThe patio outside has a really nice view, filled with a lot of not happy looking people as well. Probably felt ripped off because maybe they paid cover? We'll never know."

We skipped the beverage pairing and ordered two bottles separately - a delicious and fruity sauvignon blanc by Honig and a merlot (forgot name). The food was outstanding, the first and second time. I particularly liked the foie gras, scallops and lamb loin. All prepared just perfectly. They even provided us complimentary dish at the beginning and a drink in the middle to clean our palette.

The ribeye was well-prepared -- it was cooked even all throughout with the done-ness done accurately. It had a good sear and crusty char on the exterior which I like.

The food was wonderful. We had, for starters, the seared duck foie gras (half order), tuna tartare (half order), and Maine lobster salad. For our entrees we had the braised wagyu and cod brandade. Both were very tasty. For my dessert I had the mix Candy Bar w/ caramel ice cream. \nMy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. It was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. At least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. My next gripe is with the waiter (big Caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. I wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. I forgot my Zantac, so I didn't think drinking wine would be wise. My husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, I don't know what to call him). By the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. My husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but I convinced him against it because I wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. We tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. With the foie gras and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. A good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nSo the verdict: The food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\nI've been to many amazing restaurants, including French Laundry, Jar, Lucques, Osteria Mozza, etc... This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a fine dining establishment."

Too bad I don't remember it too well. \n\nBut because of this recent visit to Vegas, I took the liberty to visit Mix and I was so happy with it. I went to restaurant.com and got a certificate for a discounted price and it was just a delightful addition to the place. \n\nThe Mix sits high up so you get a great view of the strip. The scenary and all is really romantic and nice. The food is expensive but worth it when you find a piece of food in your mouth as you salivate from the tastes and greatness. \n\nThe service here was great. It really surprised me how amazing it was. The table was pulled out for me, the checking in with me and such -- all the extra fluff was really nice. \n\nOverall, the food was great, the atmosphere was great.

Everything was marvelous. For someone used to dining in fine restaurants, in the U.S. as well as in Europe, I don't say this often or lightly. I very rarely write reviews.\n\nThe dishes were genuine and well executed. The foie gras au torchon was exactly as it is served in France. The best way to judge is by going somewhere else the next day, which we did, and honestly, you'll want to go back to Mix. I especially liked the way the menu offered classic dishes as well as newer creations. Mom was happy as well as my indie-film-loving brother. \n\nHowever, the real reason to go is for the service. I have read some of the previous reviews and see what's going on. But here's the deal. I hope it is useful:\n\nI respect that customers come in with all kinds of expectations on the level of service. We were 10, with a baby and a 4 year girl, celebrating a pre-wedding dinner with the bride and groom. I asked for the Chef's table for privacy, but we were disappointed to find out that it was not available. Nonetheless, the hostess assured me that we would be in a special area of the restaurant that would not bother anyone else and offered us a glass of champagne, as well, for the inconvenience. She was wonderful! And she was right.\n\nI was very skeptical about sitting in the main dining room because we did not want to spoil any one else evening. But the entire staff was so attentive to our every need that I must say, the entire evening went without a hitch. Of note was a moment, early in the evening, when our 4-year-old spilled her grenadine water with its fancy straw and then had that tense frozen look that precedes the oncoming torrential scream. Within seconds, our servers swooped down with a a napkin, cleaned up and replaced her place setting with a big smile letting her know that everything was okay. Wow! It was nothing short of AMAZING. They treated her like a princess and she really felt like one. \n\nIt's easy to provide good service when everything goes well. But the true note of distinctively great service is how swiftly and professionally the staff handles problems when something goes wrong. At Mix, Mr. Ducasse has a top-notch, experienced staff of professionals -- something often lacking in today's restaurant scene. So, about the $10 sparkling water that you didn't order... it's important to brush up on 5-star restaurant etiquette, because you'll get a lot of that at this restaurant.\n\nThe whole evening was filled with extremely good service, timeliness and friendliness that matched the deliciousness of the cuisine and exceeded the expectations of each and every one of us. A memorable evening in every way."

The limo dropped us off at their hotel (The Four Seasons, which oddly enough is situated atop The Mandalay Bay) so we could play with our dog for a little and open a few presents.   Soon after, my sister led the way to Mix, on the 64th floor of The Mandalay.  Between the superlative view, the glam decor, and Alain Ducasse as the chef, we knew we were in for a treat.\n\nOur waiter, who bore a strong resemblance to Macklemore was friendly and described every item on the menu with gusto.  The five of us split a salad and the shrimp cocktail for our appetizers, and were impressed with the flavor and artful presentation.  I had the lobster for my entree which was served in a curry that was inspired by tikka masala.  Not only did a I receive a large, succulent, tender portion of my favorite crustacean but the coconut rice it came with was extraordinary.  \n\nFor dessert, we had a small gluten-free (my mom and sister have celiac disease) wedding cake from a local specialty bakery, but the restaurant had no problem with my family bringing it in.\n\nAs a treat, our waiter gave us five wristbands so we could go to the lounge with no cover charge, and watch the 7/4 fireworks.  My parents and sister opted out, but Mike and I decided to check it out.  I found the lounge to be as impressive as the restaurant, and we had a stellar vantage point.  \n\nI would highly recommend this place, especially to people celebrating an extra-special occasion.

I told him I never tried Magellan.  He said most of his regulars order Magellan for gin and tonics, but it's not as good as Tanqueray for martinis.

When we tried to order from the tasting menu (7PM on Saturday night) they told us that they wouldn't be serving it because they were expecting a busy night. We complained telling them we would leave if we did't get the tasting menu so they did make an exception. The service was slow throughout dinner, the prices all said and done were pretty ridiculous and the food was not that impressive for the price. Additionally, they don't honor \"China Grill\" (Management Company) gift cards here. Overall I would give it an A for Ambiance but an F for the food experience and service. If you read this review - Please take my advice - Maybe go to MIX for a cocktail before dinner and then move onto one of the many great restaurants in Vegas to eat.

Check out the view from the lounge's bathroom, it was an unexpected surprise.\n\nThe restaurants decor is also very nice; I tend to like simple and artistic aesthetics so this place was definitely easy on the eyes."

            "review": "Excellent food. I'm not a big fan of French food, but this place is very good. The big eye tuna tasted like they just pulled it from the Pacific. Very fresh. The decor is pretty cool. It reminds me of something you would see in a South Beach. It has an amazing view of the city from the top of Mandalay Bay. You can have a drink outside and enjoy the view also, but I was getting sick looking out the window. Too high up for me."

            "review": "Mix was a huge, did I say HUGE, disappointment.  I would not recommend it to my enemies.  I would have hoped that for a $400 bill (for 2 people) I would get to experience some amazing food.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with strung glass 'bubbles' acting as the sculptural centerpiece of the entire dining room.  My co-worker and I asked to be seated by the window to enjoy the beautiful Las Vegas night view from the 64th floor of  THE Hotel.  The hostess very coldly told us that the only-left window table was reserved for a \"marketing\" party.  WTF.  And for the record, that table was empty the entire night.\n\nWe decided to go for the \"A Taste of Mix\" tasting menu, the wine pairing, and the tuna tartare appetizer.  Pretty much fail.  We began our eating experience with an amuse bouche concoction of goat cheese, a yellowy mash, and an olive.  The girl sitting at the table next to us blurted out \"Gross\" when our server described what it was.  And indeed, it was gross.  It felt like gunk in my mouth.    \n\nFor starters, we had the Maine lobster salad.  The lobster was juicy and delicious with the sweetness of the melon. If you are ever unsure about what appetizer to order, you can always count on the tuna tartare being good at basically any SF restaurant.  The tuna tartare here had no flavor and DESPERATELY needed to be hit with some lime juice to punch up the flavors.  It was just a bland blob for $24.  \n\nWe moved onto our main courses - the stripped bass and roasted duck breast.  The bass was delicious with a sprinkling of little asparagus slices.  However, the blanquette sauce was a bit too cheesy for me after a few bites.  The duck was just weird.  It looked like a lame piece of boiled strip of meat that you would think would cut easily, but no, it was difficult to cut.  It did not have much flavor and simply did not look appetizing.  The baby turnips that the server said was \"SLOWLY COOKED for 5 HOURS\" looked like something my mom could whip out in 10 mins.    \n\nI must say that the pre-dessert was the bright light during this dinner.  The passion fruit juice/mix of sorts topped with a sweet coconuty frothy cream in a martini was DELICIOUS.  The sweetness of the cream and the tartness worked beautifully.  \n\nThe tropical fruit sensation, consisting of guava sorbet and finely diced mango and other fruits was another let down.  The sorbet was incredibly tart and the fruits simply added to the tartness.  It desperately needed something sweet (like chocolate) to balance it out.  Our server noticed that we did no finish much of our plates and gave us freshly baked Madeline cookies (right out of the molds) with some nutella.  It was ok.  lol...not enough to make it a good dinner.\n\nIn addition to the pre-dessert, I thoroughly enjoyed my wine pairings.  I am not a wine person, but I did get to try two awesomely SWEET wines - the 2007 Riesling, Dr Thanisch and the 2007 Moscato D'asti, D. Rivetti. YUM YUM YUM :)\n\nYou are better off going to the Bellagio buffet.  Or just having a drink at the adjacent Mix lounge while enjoying the view.  I would suggest you gamble away $400 then going here.  At least then you might get something in return."

            "review": "I was wary of Mix because of the mixed reviews(pun intended), and asked, when making our reservations, if the exec chef would be in that Tuesday night.   It would be our only Michelin restaurant  on this trip and I wanted to visit the Mix lounge next door.  We had an early reservation in order to make it to Le Reve, so there was almost no one in the restaurant, and there was still sunlight.   The restaurant seems to face east and west, so there was really no direct view of the strip, so the view was a little overstated.  The room was marvelous, with the thousand bubble chandelier--glass balls handblown in Italy and imported to Mix.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  We always had our water and iced tea refilled with smiles.  They served us a French butter and a chocolate butter, which paired wonderfully with the walnut bread provided.\n\nWe started with the spicy tuna salad, which was really a tuna tartare and the sea bream sashimi.  The sashimi had a popcorn garnish to add an interesting texture, and it was fresh, but we weren't wowed by it.  The tuna tartare though was delicious--you could smell its freshness as it was placed on our table, and we enjoyed every morsel of this dish!  For entrees, we had the tenderloin and the surf N turf, which was stuffed chicken with a small piece of lobster.  My lovely wife gobbled up the delicious lobster and had a little harder time with the chicken, which I eventually finished.  The tenderloin was small, but tender and flavorful and was one of the best steaks I've had--better than Morton's, but not as good as Jiraffe's.  For dessert, we had their signature \"candy bar\", which is kind of a combination of a cake bar with a crunchy waffle-like bottom--very good--and the decaf coffee had that nice \"cigarette\" taste to it.  \n\nAfterwards, we walked over to the empty lounge and marveled at the view there.  It had a Northern exposure and you could see the Las Vegas Strip in all its gaudy magnificence.  We enjoyed our meal very much, and would like to return to enjoy a cocktail in the lounge afterwards."

            "review": "I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant! Everything about it is AMAZING! So to start off the restaurant's decor is beautiful, add that with the view of the strip and it's even better.. You can even see the view from the bathroom stalls! So when we arrived we had realized that the staff had made our reservations for the wrong day, LUCKILY the staff was amazing and seated us with a wait of only 15-20 minutes! While we were waiting for our table we had a few drinks at the bar which is attached to the restaurant but still kind of it's own separate lounge. \n\nNow on to the food.. I'd have to say that the food here was the best I've had in awhile, and albeit pricey, but totally worth every penny. I had the special of the night which was a crusted fish ( I can't remember what exactly) with a lemon infused Parmesan foam. It was orgasmic it was so good! The service was great, and my experience here was fabulous! I will definitely be coming back again ASAP!"

            "review": "I'm not sure how my girlfriends and I decided upon 'Fix', but we were staying at the Mandalay Bay and wanted to go to a nice trendy restaurant. BAD BAD DECISION!!  \n\nWell it sure was trendy with it's completely white interior and all white plush booths but there was nothing nice about the service.  It started off fairly well; we made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  \n\nI ordered the sea scallops and I remember there were only four.  Eh, not unexpected so I decided to take my sweet time with them.  If I'm paying $30+ for four scallops I'm going to relish every bite!  Well I only finished two of them when my plate was whisked away from me.   Just scooped away with my fork in hand looking in disbelief at the direction the guy took it. Uh hello? He didn't even ask me if I was finished.  Something like that should never happen, at least not at a 'nicer' place such at this.  Fine. Whatever,  I let it slip bc I don't like making a scene.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of it.  Sometime during the meal (pre-scallop taking incident) our waiter came by, set down a bowl of Mac and Cheese and said it was complimentary.  We received the bill and noticed the $20 Mac and Cheese charge.  So despite protests from the rest of my friends to let it go, I called the waiter over and asked him about the \"complimentary\" Mac and Cheese.  Instead of saying sorry, the below was said:\n\nWaiter (smirking): Did you enjoy it? \nMe (seething at this point): Um.  Yes, it was really good \nWaiter: Good.  I'll get this taken off\nMe: Thanks.\n\nI will never understand the point to his question.  If I had said no, would he had taken it off the bill?"

            "review": "We rang in New Years 2010 at Mix Lounge in Vegas! The experience was awesome! We reserved a table for our party of 4 which may have seemed a little pricey, but given we had seats to rest between dancing throughout the night - the money was well spent. The table included the entrance fee for all four of us, a bottle of premium liquor, one bottle of champagne, and mixers. Our table was perfectly situated near the dance floor and by the floor to ceiling windows giving us full view of the Vegas skyline and the fireworks at midnight (without the chill of having to stand outside). The hostess and servers were awesome and attended to our every need immediately. The atmosphere, DJ, view of the city skyline, and fireworks at midnight were more than we expected. It was TRULY a wonderful experience. I highly recommend visiting this lounge/club and will definitely come back! Totally worth it!"
