            "review": "Very cool place.  The atmosphere is fantastic and the staff is incredible.  Everyone knew exactly when we needed them and no one overstayed their welcome.  We started with the lobster bisque, which was a little salty in my opinion, and a little pricey at $20.  The presentation was nice; a gravy boat to poor the broth over lobster, cracker and caviar.  We had the foie, the steak tartare, roasted brussel sprouts with bacon, and a New York steak.  The steak was the clear winner.  I ordered it on the rare side of medium rare and they couldn't have done a better job.  Nice grill marks, good sear, and delicious flavor.  The brussel sprouts were good, but I have made them a little better at home myself.  The foie and steak tartare were both excellent.  In fact, my date may argue that the steak tartare was the winner for the night.\n\nBottom line, if you want to try something different and you want to go somewhere that's off the beaten path, The Barrymore is a great choice."

In a sea of overpriced, big hotel, big name chef corporate food, The Barrymore emerges with amazing food and I just had the burger.  It was a taste sensation with the bacon marmalade stealing the show.  Oh yes, the bacon infused bread deserves a mention too.  With wines 50 and Under, you can't go wrong.  If they have room, I'll have dinner for 25 here for my 50th!"

            "review": "I've been here a few times. The first two times were amazing...the menu was edgy with dishes like sweet breads and braised beef cheek. I went back last week and was disappointed that the new chef seems to have abandoned the old menu. The apps were unimpressive this time around...we had a beef tartare that was overwhelmed with mustard seed and an artichoke that was overpowered by the pesto sauce. My sea bass entree was delicious though and we ended on a nice note with some tasty pumpkin ice cream. We'll return but hopefully to what we loved about it our first few visits! Excellent service as usual!"

            "review": "The Barrymore is owned by Block 16 Hospitality which also operates LBS Burger, Holsteins, and Public House. In short, these guys are killing it! I can highly recommend every one of these restaurants. \n\nThe Barrymore is in a strange north strip hotel location that is not all that appealing from the outside. Once you get inside the restaurant that all changes. The decor is unique and it has a very nice feel. On the night I was there it was getting a little loud in the main dining room although it was mostly from one large party. \n\nMy wife and I both tried one of their speciality cocktails. She had the Harvest which is an an apple cinnamon drink that tasted just like an apple pie. I had the Basil which is a burbon drink with basil and lemon. It was one of the most unique cocktails I have ever had and also one of the most delicious. They also have a 50 under 50 wine list which is great for those of us like me that are pretty ignorant about wine and don't often buy expensive bottles.\n\nI had Lobster Deviled Eggs, a tomato and mozzarella salad (a special that night), and the Short Rib Entree.\n\nThe Lobster Deviled Eggs were delicious and topped with a bit of caviar which added a great salty taste. My problem with them was that there was little to no lobster taste. For a $9 egg, I was expecting some lobster chunks.\n\nThe salad was amazing. They didn't re-invent anything here, but the dressing was perfect, the tomatos fresh, and the cheese was some of the softest and most delicious mozzarella I have ever eaten. A real winner here, I would order it again if it was on the regular menu.\n\nThe Short Rib was a generous portion with carrot mousseline (puree), red pearl onion, bacon marmalade, and natural jus. The meat was for tender and delicious. The pearl onions were pickled which made for an excellent suprise. I don't think I even need to get into the bacon marmalade, it was just as good as you might expect.\n\nGreat food, great service, unique cocktails, I'll be back here!"

I was a little hesitant to eat here because it looked a little slow and we did not want to be the only ones there, however we discovered the main dining room was actually quite busy. Our server Sean and the GM were so hospitable, funny, and just really cool guys. I am so happy that I spent my birthday dinner here, and I appreciate the excellent service that can be hard to come by sometimes. I definitely recommend this place! I tried foie gras for the first time and OMG! The Barrymore cocktail was delicious as well as everyone else's plates I took a bite from including: the roasted duck special, scallops and oxtail, and a perfectly textured steak! Thanks guys :)"

I continue to enjoy going to the Barrymore, because it is a touch unexpected in its location.  If you would rather support the little guy versus the big guy, this is your place!  \n\nIt is small, intimate, classy and a throwback to the nostalgic days of Las Vegas 30 years ago.  The food is good, but I really enjoy their little bar the most.  It is small, it feels vibrant yet is intimate as well, it has a window wall to see outside and feel that sense of space and they are craftsman at making good cocktails.  I will continue to keep it in the rotation of my options of either going out with girlfriends or a quiet dinner with just my husband."

            "review": "It is just ok. \n\nI'm not a local so I was hoping to find a place off the strip on my visit to Vegas.  The reviews appear to be promising but unfortunately the service and quality of the food was not the best. \n\nThe restaurant is within a small hotel that does need some renovation. Lobby is quiet and after leaving the cosmopolitan my first impression was that it was dead. Any other place in the USA I probably wouldn't have noticed. \n\nThe actual decor is nice and in good taste. The place is tiny so I do recommend making reservations. The hostess did offer outside or inside seating. I recommend inside since the outside is a simply patio and the decor of the inside is nicer. \n\nWait staff. Although they were nice an accommodating, it did take awhile (15 min) to get our drinks and some bread. Speaking of bread, I would have appreciated a heads up that the bread has bacon in it. I do my best not to each pork/beef etc so that wasn't cool. \n\nThe waiter really pushed hard for  the special after I came thinking the scallops might be a good choice. Not sure if that was because of the quality or what but he made it clear not to order the scallops. \n\nThe food was just 'ok\".\n\nThe Octopus, slight over cooked. They also gave me a huge piece that needed to be cut, not knife so left that on the plate. \n\nFoie Gras - not cooked enough, cold. Made the fat taste like fat. Foie Gras can be delicious and this time it tasted like fat. \n\nThe special and halibut were tasty but not worth ever coming back. \n\nThe only good thing was the Barrymore drink. That was good. \n\nOverall not really impressed. To bad, i would have like to have had a great meal."

            "review": "I ate at the Barrymore on my last night in Vegas. I was staying at the Encore and it is literally just a short walk around the corner. The decor is very cool and reminded me of what I thought Vegas must have been like in the 60's. It was a great alternative to some of the cheesiness of the strip.  \n\nOur waiter was very friendly and funny. He cracked us up a bunch of times during the meal but was always professional and attentive. \n\nFood was delicious. I had never had sweetbreads before and our waiter told me all about them and encouraged me to try them... and I am glad he did. They were delicious. I then was served what was possibly the most mouth watering steak I have ever had. Cooked absolutely perfectly medium rare. I asked the waiter for a wine recommendation and it paired perfectly. I was too stuffed to eat a dessert. \n\nI'd recommend this place if you are on he north end of the Strip."

            "review": "My fiancee and I dined at The Barrymore in July 2014. It was a Wednesday evening, so the dining room was not crowded. We liked the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. Our server was very good and very responsive to our requests. The pre-dinner bread was tasty, we both especially liked the warm pretzel bread. I ordered the NY Strip and my fiancee had Scallops. Her scallops were very good and the Strip had good flavor and the proper temperature. It may be personal preference but I was disappointed with the Mac N' Cheese side and the bearnaise sauce that I ordered to accompany my steak. Like most steak restaurants, dinner for 2 including cocktail and wine was over $200. I would dine at the Barrymore again, although I don't think it is my favorite steak restaurant in Vegas right now."

            "review": "This restaurant was fantastic. Our bill for 2 people came to $202, but $60 of that was drinks and another $50 of that was appetizers because I wanted to try foie gras (since I've never had it) AND the lobster mac & cheese (since it's like their specialty).  So if you're strapped for cash I think you could probably feed 2 people for under $100 if you order wisely.  Bring enough for a good tip because our waiter was awesome.  The food is really good, and since it's not located on the main strip the place wasn't very crowded.  You still need to make a reservation, but I was able to get one about 5 hours before dinner time on a Thursday night.\n\nThere are a few restaurants in Vegas that are of similar quality but they all cost significantly more.  If you want to eat at a really nice place and get a good bang for your buck, the Barrymore is for you."

First, our awesome waitress recommended the artichoke as an app, and who knew an artichoke could be that good?!? I've been dreaming about it since.  I got the short ribs, which were hands down the best I've ever had.  I would have licked the plate if I could, the sauce was so good.  My boyfriend had the duck confit, which was served over farro, and it was also excellent.  Both our cocktails were great as well.  Cannot say enough good things, and will be back next time we're in Vegas!"

With only a handful of tables and an exceptional wine menu, you and your \"main squeeze\" should have no reason to enjoy the evening. Granted, it is primarily steaks - they are GREAT steaks. Go ahead - make the trip to The Barrymore. It is on the outskirts but worth the drive."

Our experience was one of the worst we've had over the years in LV.\n\nFood - Started w roasted artichoke app.  It was roasted and buried under a mountain of arugula.  Flavor was ok, but the leaves were blackened.  Give it a pass.  Halibut entree was sooooo over-cooked it was almost a brick.  The filet w bordelaise was cooked perfectly but there was a metallic flavor that we couldn't identify.  Both entrees went uneaten.\n\nGets a second star because we got a bottle of Kistler."

It smelled like disgusting, salty fish the second we walked in. Yuck! \n\nIf you don't like steak or seafood, forget it. They had ONE other option for non-steak-and-seafood lovers, the free range chicken. It was a whopping $29 and I REALLY wasn't that impressed with it. The skin was kind of burnt, and the potatoes it came with were bland. I tried the tuna tartar appetizer and I wasn't feeling that, either. \n\nThis definitely should be a 3-star restaurant. They make it seem all glitzy & glamorous in the photos, but it's actually in a jenky ass hotel located way off the strip. The additional star is for the good service, they did have that on point. \n\nAlso, it's so dark in there that my older co-workers had to use a freaking flashlight to see their menus. Pathetic! \n\nOverall, this little hole in the wall is overrated!"

He provided great recommendations on wine, apps, and entrees, he even called my BF and I a cab following dinner.  \nEverything we ordered was good.  If you get the lobster mac and cheese, I recommend splitting an entree with an extra side.   I had the burger, which I never order anywhere and it was amazing.  It's served with an english muffin rather than a typical burger bun, it's lighter and allows you to get the full flavor of the beef patty and chutney.  \n\nYou defiantly feel like you stepped back in time with the old Hollywood feel.  It's a classic restaurant I could see the Rat Pack hanging out at.\n\nHighly recommended for date night with that special someone!"

We are seated behind a large table of twenty people and are afraid we'd be lost to good service, but, were surprised we had a very attentive server and felt like we're the only ones in the room.\n\nI started with a drink, the Barrymore, gentleman jack, solerno blood orange liqueur, orange marmalade, cocchi vermouth di torino, orange bitters, and orange zest.  it was warming to the soul!\n\nOur appetizers included several.  First we got the lobster mac & cheese, it is smothered with a  mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce, very creamy and so so good.  We also got the heirloom tomato & burrata cheese salad. It had cucumbers, oregano, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, served with the best tomatoes, cut in thick slices, and the cheese is a cream induced mozzarella, the flavors are a cool delight.  We also got the deviled eggs and a lobster bisque soup.  Both of these were very good as well.  We're getting full, but our main entrees are to come. \n\nI choose the diver scallops, big scallops wrapped with serrano ham, the sauce is a saffron rouille and boullabaisse broth.  These were some of the best scallops I have had.  To finish off the meal, I got a tispy earl, harvey's bristol cream sherry with earl gray tea.  This was one of the best meals I can recall eating.  The service was great, the food cooked to perfection and the memory, unbeatable.  Thanks to my husband for a great choice!"

            "review": "This is in a small resort slightly off the strip it used to be a little known gem but is now quite popular in the local and tourist scene you will want to make reservations.  The whole aspect of this restaurant has been thought out, the food and the ambiance.  The hostesses, wait staff and bartenders will make this a experience to remember.  The D\u00e9cor is a retro Hollywood with huge booths where you feel like you're in the middle of a mobbish Hollywood movie (think the movie Casino and old 30's 40's Hollywood), reserve a booth if you eat inside.  If you come on a time of year where the weather allows for it, eat outside on the patio they have an amazing firewall so fun to sit and watch.  \n\nA lot of prior reviewers will tell you to get the burger, it is great but there are other options I enjoyed as well.  The Lobster Deviled eggs with caviar is a fun interesting, worth the price in my opinion because it is not something I have heard of before but not amazing.  The lobster mac-n-cheese made me reminisce about childhood but remember I am an adult ;) The seared foie comes with a sweet sauce and a toast the buttery flavors of the foie with the sweet flavors of the sauce amazing.  I also recommend the roasted artichoke they have a different take on an old favorite of mine.  On to the main courses as I said earlier the burger is highly recommended but I feel there are better items to choose from, here are a couple I have had.  If you are into Lamb with potato sauce, snap peas, au jus it is extremely good very flavorful with a full blend of the sauces and the meat.  I also enjoyed the braised short rib comes with carrots onions a bacon sauce and au ju.  Braised just enough on the outside and perfection with the rest.  I have also had one of the seasonal pastas the one I had at the time was a truffle ravioli with a buttery truffle sauce but they change all the time so I cannot recommend the one I chose. For sides I enjoyed the asparagus with parmesan gratin, the creamed spinach and the creamed corn with lobster and bacon.  \n\nThey have pretty much any kind of drinks both alcoholic, non-alcoholic plus specialty drinks and a amazing wine list to chose from.  The menu does change slightly with season and chefs moods so not everything besides the main menu will remain the same."

            "review": "The restaurant is located in The Royal Resort. When you turn into the property from Convention Center Drive, there's a small parking lot next to the hotel. Then from there, it's a short distance to the restaurant.\n\nWe (there were six of us) went for a surprise birthday dinner for my best friend Randy. The interior, decor, and ambience is very cool. Beautiful too. We had a large half-circle booth with Randy at the head of the table in an extra seat and it was comfortable (the restaurant was a tad too warm, but it may have just been that evening).\n\nWe started with beers and their specialty cocktails. I had \"The Barrymore\" (Gentleman Jack, Solerno Blood Orange liqueur, orange marmalade, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, orange bitters, and orange zest); very strong, but tasty. Everyone else really enjoyed their cocktails as well. I tried the others, but don't recall what they were!\n\nFor an appetizer, Ruben and I shared the \"Panzanella\" (marinated tomato, fried bread, cucumber, red onion, burrata cheese and banyuls vinaigrette). All the vegetables were fresh and delicious, loved the fried bread, and the vinaigrette was light with good flavor. Burrito cheese is something I have been raving about since I had it on a delicious pizza last Fall, however, I didn't really care for it on this dish. It was served as a huge chunk sitting in the center of the \"salad\" that you had to pull apart. It was awkward for me.\n\nFor entr\u00e9es, Ruben had the \"Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken\" (mushroom risotto, nueske bacon, and baby mustard greens), which he really enjoyed, and I had the \"Vadouvan Squash Curry\" (squash, root vegetables in a rich curry with moroccan-style couscous). I tried his mushroom risotto and it was delicious. I also really enjoyed my curry! Wonderful flavor with a lot of depth and the couscous was yummy. Randy ordered a Filet Mignon with a side of mashed potato - delicious! The filet was cooked PERFECTLY and the seasoning was great (he didn't even need to use the B\u00e9arnaise sauce he ordered). Also, the mashed potato was ridiculously creamy and flavorful. We ALL loved it.\n\nFor a birthday dessert, we ordered the \"Warm Chocolate Cake\" (praline fudge sauce, hazelnut brittle, milk chocolate sorbet) for Randy. Very good. I ordered the Tiramisu\n(mascarpone mousse, coffee-rum ladyfingers, caramel espresso biscotti). It was meh; the ladyfingers were dry for my liking and there was not nearly enough \"tiramisu\" flavor in the dessert.\n\nWe had a really nice experience from start to finish. The restaurant is relatively small with limited seating, so groups are restricted to 1.5-2 hour seatings (I believe). So, our post-dinner chat session was brought to a halt by the manager, however, they were kind enough to offer us a space in their lounge with a bottle of champagne. We declined since we needed to head out, but that was very thoughtful and well-strategized of them. All of us were very pleased and desire to return!"

The portion of the foie gras was substantial and the filet was ultra-tender.\n\nEverything we had ordered was simply delightful and delicious. I would definitely return."

We had two appetizers, two entrees and a couple glasses of wine and the bill was just shy of $100.  It's definitely tucked away and probably won't get the attention it deserves, but a great spot nonetheless.  I thought the food quality was great, portion sizes were spot on - not too large, not too small.  I thought the duck dish was a little salty, but it was also confit...  Anyone who is looking for a nice, quiet place to enjoy some good food, give this place a chance.  Wished the hotel offered valet but parking out back isn't terrible."

It is in a very unassuming location inside the lobby of the Royal Resort just off the strip -- but don't let the location fool you as this place is fantastic and rivals the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  There's an old school Hollywood feel to the decorations and the vibe and at the bar one can imagine Don Draper coming up for an old fashioned.\n\nThe food was excellent.  We ordered filets across the board and everyone commented how the filets here were just as good, if not better, than any of the \"fancier\" restaurants in Las Vegas.  Appetizers were excellent -- we shared the grilled octopus, the caesar salad and the baby iceberg.  And don't tell anyone in California, but we also had some foie gras which was delicious.\n\nDrinks were excellent both at dinner and at the bar.  I'd recommend the Manhattan or the Vesper.\n\nOur waitress was fantastic.  Attentive without being over-bearing, and with a quirky sense of humor.  Best of all, she put up with our lames jokes.\n\nCannot wait to come back."

After a few disappointing meals in Vegas, I decided to Yelp for a good restaurant, and immediately was drawn to the numerous glowing reviews. I was a little surprised to find the restaurant located in an older hotel (The Royal Resort) but don't let that fool you...and if you can look at it from the perspective of an experience of vintage Las Vegas, you'll actually appreciate the location. Upon entering The Barrymore, I was greeted by a warm hostess, and treated as though completely appreciated for choosing them. My waitress was equally warm, professional, attentive, and thorough. \n\nThe decor at the Barrymore is very deliberate old Las Vegas, without a hint of pretentiousness. It feels like it's a part of Las Vegas history, even though it's a fairly new restaurant. Not many restaurants pull this off well; if they are \"vintage\", most seem blatantly contrived. Everything from the continual sea of light blue upholstery velvet, to the wood frames mirrored matrix on the walls, to the film-reel adorned suspended ceiling tile grid says authentic vintage '60's Vegas to me. Not a single dumb, framed fake photo anywhere.\n\nOk, so now the food. One word. Exquisite. Starting with the complimentary trio bread basket, which consisted of slightly toasted baguette slices, a sweeter wheat bread, and a spicy flatbread. For an appetizer, I started with the lobster Mac 'n Cheese (highly recommended), which was a perfect blend of flavor and consistency. My entr\u00e9e was one of the specials that evening, a sole dish that was spectacular. I wish I'd have inquired further about the makeup of the dish but I was too consumed with the goodness and flavor of it. Every bite was succulent and savored.\n\nChris, the attending manager, made his rounds to each table and talked for a few minutes....a very personable gent...a perfect personality fit for the restaurant. \n\nUpon leaving The Barrymore, my wallet was a little  lighter, palette extremely satisfied, and the evening wonderfully fulfilled. The only thing that would have made it better would have been to share the experience with my girlfriend, but since I was in LV at a conference, I had to unfortunately dine alone. \n\nI wish for nothing but a well deserved and long success for the staff and owners."

I started with the foie gras which was decent, but not worth the asking price in comparison to what I have had elsewhere for the same price. I ordered the salmon and my dining companion ordered the chicken (she never orders chicken, but it looked good on the menu). The salmon dish was generally ok. However...the skin on the salmon wasn't crispy. Why serve salmon with the skin in such a prevalent position if it isn't crispy? It's not that difficult of a cooking process. The chicken was a bit bland for us but the other parts of that particular dish were pretty good. We also ordered the mojito on the menu and a manhattan. The mojito was pretty good...but the manhattan was kind of awful. It was super sweet and tasted almost like it was straight vermouth. I intentionally tried to order something classic since this place isn't super modern and it ended up being a huge cocktail fail. Should I have said something? If it was just the 2 of us I probably would have...but it would have kind of ruined our party's atmosphere I think. On top of that, they charged me 17 for this terrible manhattan (and I didn't even request a specific liquor...so I think they upcharged something without asking). \n\nI can't say that I really understand the high reviews for this place. Maybe it is appealing to a different demographic than me. It is one thing to go to an experimental restaurant and have some culinary duds, but at a place that tries to be so classic and charge so much, you either execute the classics well or you are going to fail in this day and age.\n\nThe rest of the party generally seemed to enjoy things though so that's always good."

The second batch was a little better but it still wasn't as tender as other octopus that we had in the past. The manager kindly took the octopus off our bill which was much appreciated. I probably wouldn't order this again and go for the lobster mac & cheese instead.\n\nMashed potatoes: 4/5\nReally solid mashed potatoes. Really creamy and smooth. Not the best I've ever had but still pretty delicious.\n\nSea bass: 5/5\nThis dish was AMAZING!!! This was our favorite dish of the night. The fish was cooked beautifully and the miso broth that it came with was delicious. I didn't care for the rice and frankly I didn't need it at all. Definitely a must have!\n\nShort ribs: 4.5/5\nThe short ribs were tender, loved the sauce. The root veggies were perfectly cooked. Second favorite dish of the night."

The steak was $48 without any sides. We decided to order 3 appetizers. Two were just ok - lobster mac n chz and fried green tomato with crab meat. The lobster bisque was disgusting we didnt eat more than one bite each and no one asked if anything was wrong. The best thing we ate were the side of french fries I ordered for the kids. Total bill with tip was $78."

We ordered the snapper and shared it.  It was succulent.  The vandouvan squash curry dish was great.  I am usually not a fan of curry, but this dish wasn't over the top spicy.  Our mushrooms and asparagus were wonderful as well.  We cheated with the chocolate cake dessert and I'm so happy we did.  It was delicious.  \n\nIt didn't seem like we had a lot of food for what we ordered, but it ended up being the right amount.

We were there on a Friday at 7pm and the restaurant seemed a little on the empty side. Then dining room was very nice and the service was incredible! There must have been 2 staff members to every person working that night.\n\nWe didnt order a entree because we were strickly here for the Frenach onion soup and the Lobster mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was very creamy and wonderful! The french onion was probably the best we have ever had and we eat a lot of it. The broth was really dark and flavorful and the bowl was a decent amount. The bacon bread was pretty darm good too. We were not sure if it would be enough food, but being it was so rich we were both stuffed! The waiter was wonderful and even asked if we wanted more bread.\n\nThe only down fall which was my fault for not reading was their Bellini was not blended and i have never heard/tried a non frozen version. it was good, but it was really a tiny amount and not worth the $11. I ended up getting 2 Huge frozen Bellini drinks from fat tuesday on my trip anyways HAHA. This place was excellent and we will be back!"

We wanted to go somewhere that was good, intimate enough for some quality time, and a place that we haven't been to.  The Barrymore fit just right.  We had reservations, which really wasn't needed since we were the only ones here when we started our dinner.  Our server was fantastic.  Our server made it a point to give full descriptions of everything on their menu, especially their steaks. He even brought out a raw steak just to show us the size of it before it was cooked. I had my eye on their Filet Mignon since I learned about the Barrymore, but ended up with their bone-in-filet.  My dish was pretty good. I'm not saying it was the best steak I've had, but it definitely wasn't the worse. It was still tasty, tender, and my portion was huge. I only regret that I didn't stick with the filet mignon, which in my opinion, tends to have more flavor.  Regardless, I was still satisfied with my meal. My girlfriend was satisfied with her meal as well, but thought that their lobster mac was missing something. We just couldn't figure out what.  \n\nOverall, I would suggest The Barrymore to anyone looking for an intimate dinner, a good steak, and great service. \n\nPS:  Can't forget about their bread basket.  One word....delicious!!"

I picked this place based on the great reviews, and I have to say I was a bit skeptical as our cab driver pulled up to the Royal Resort Hotel (a hotel off the strip I had never heard of). With that said, the meal did not disappoint. The restaurant itself has a very cool ambiance and decorated quite classically--I'd venture to say that it doesn't really fit with that particular hotel.\n\nWe started off with the Diver Scallops and the Lobster Mac & Cheese. I didn't love the scallops, but not because they weren't tasty--I'm just not a big fan to begin with. I've had Lobster Mac many times before and it's usually delicious, how could those two things combined not be? This time was no different, I would highly recommend trying it, but make sure to split it so that you don't ruin your meal-- it's heavy.\n\nLastly, for entrees my friend and I split the Black Bass and the Short Rib per the recommendation of our server. The Black Bass was wonderful and a great alternative for someone who doesn't wish to order steak. The Short Rib was also very tasty, it easily pulled apart as it should, but I would have liked for it to be a little more juicy. With that said, the flavor was great and both entr\u00e9es were very enjoyable.\n\nThe Barrymore is a great place to get a nice dinner that won't cost you an arm and a leg. Similar dinners directly on the strip could have easily cost twice as much. I'd highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking for upscale, quality food, and good service without having to blow all of your winnings in one place."

I have been coming to LV for 10 years now so I know my way around, when my companion suggested this place I agreed.  I ordered the short ribs which managed to be not only on the tough side but tasteless as well.  I also ordered the mashed potatoes which were whipped to a liquid state.  The only highlight was the breadbasket.  I did have one drink the honey badger which tasted good.  However, within an hour eating I vomited and proceeded onto a miserable cycle of vomiting and diarrhea for the next day or so.  Due to this dinning experience I lost entire vacation day and front row seats to a show.  Btw my companion also got sick.  I wish I could give a negative rating as this was the worst dinning experience I have had in Las Vegas ever.  So if you decided to go off strip and want to give this place a try just make sure you are staying at a nice hotel since you will be there for the next day or so recuperating."

He sat us down quickly and introduced us to the wine and food menus. He gave us a few moments to look through the wines- a nice assortment from different regions across the world. We were then introduced to Israel, the \"jack of all trades\" at the restaurant. After consultation with both gentlemen, we decided on a white \"Les Abeilles,\" and we couldn't be more satisfied. \n\nWe started with the Lobster Mac n Cheese, Israel letting us know it's a crowd favorite. The Marscapone and freshly made shell pasta complimented the slices of lobster quite well. The assortment of warm breads that were brought to the table were also a great plus, and the butter was room temperature- not even some swanky restaurants on the strip do that! \n\nMy partner and I were both craving sea bass, so we ordered both kinds: Chilean sea bass and European.\n\nThe European sea bass was crisp on the outside and thinly sliced, paired with a saffron ratatouille and spices. It was a great pairing.\n\nThe Chilean sea bass was seared on the top  and a smooth texture on the inside, perfectly cooked. It was placed on an English pea risotto that was so creamy and delectable, that alone I'd fly back for. After trying both dishes, superb in their own styles, I would recommend the Chilean sea bass if you only wanted to order one- you won't regret it. \n\nWe finished our meal with a dulce de leche cake and a strawberry compote and ice cream. A fresh finish to a savory meal. \n\nThroughout our entire eating experience, I commend the staff for being engaging and accommodating to our every need. They were friendly, thoughtful, and had great conversation to give to folks while they dined at their establishment. \n\nAnd to top it all off, Israel introduced us to the legendary Joe Vento, house musician who played alongside some of the greats on the Vegas strip throughout the decades. He's a regular at The Barrymore, playing routinely at the hotel piano in the lobby right outside the restaurant. If you catch him performing, or find him dining in the restaurant, make sure you have a conversation with him. Who knows, he may just play a ballad or two. :)\n\nAnd so I finish with this- if you are one who frequently visits Las Vegas or it's your first time, take some time to indulge yourself in all that is the Barrymore. Don't hesitate to make the trip a little off the strip to have some great food in an intimate environment. \n\nSo what are you waiting for..?"

The Bar area and waiting area are small but there is plenty of seating through out, so you don't feel as if you're piled on top of one another. \n\nOn to the food: The short-rib was so tender you could cut it with a fork, it was served with small potatoes, carrots and a red wine glaze. The Creamed Spinach ( there are two options) was prepared so well with out being too soupy or the spinach to stringy. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was great, I'm not a fan of seafood in my Mac and Cheese, but this dish gets a pass- it was really good. Other items that my party dined on were:  Cream corn w/ Lobster and Bacon, Muscovy Duck, Jidori Chicken  and Miso Marinated Sea Bass - from the reactions at the table they were all excellent.  \n\nAs for Drinks: The Watermelon martini was a hit all around at our table - it was light and refreshing with just the right mix of Watermelon Liqueur and Watermelon Vodka not too sweet and not too strong - Perfect!.   \n\nThe service was fabulous -  our waitress Kendra was an absolute delight.

Creamed corn stood out. \n\nThe rib eye was cooked to the right temperature, but the one thing that was dissapointing was the crust. It was too salty. It wasn't just mine. The table consensus was that the crust of all the steaks were too salty. I found myself having to eat the steak with something else to help counter the saltiness. I finished about 3/4 of the steak and had to quit. With all the sides and appetizers, I couldn't hang anymore. \n\nService was friendly and they cracked a few jokes as well.

Our waiter's demeanor changed (and not in a good way) when we did not want to order dessert. Between us six, I'm thinking our bill was at least $500.  Not a bad night for him, I thought.\nWhy four stars?  Food was good not great. I really enjoyed the ambiance. That's what gave this place a four in my book. \nA definite must- see/experience."

Outside of the excellent quality food and moderate pricing (especially in Vegas) there was one thing that stood out above all. That was the service that we recieved. I would venture to say this was the best service I have had from any restaurant. They were friendly, funny and attentive to the tinest of details. For me this took the Barrymore to the next level. If ever in Vegas and you want fine dining and take a break from the insanity of the Strip this is the place to eat."

The Barrymore is one of the best new venues to come along in many years, possibly during our entire stay.   The ambiance, service and unique menu combine to offer a one of a kind experience.  \n\nMy family and I had Thanksgiving dinner at the Barrymore.  Our meal started with grilled octopus, calamari and lobster mac and cheese.  The grilled octopus is a sleeper, please try it.  Our entrees consisted of lobster, veal porterhouse and the short ribs.  All were impeccably prepared and presented.  Our outstanding server, recommended a side not on the menu, roasted artichoke risotto.  Good heavens, you have to ask for this side!  Our meal concluded with a sampler of outstanding desserts.\n\nThe Barrymore more than lives up to the fine review it received from CNN.   It combines old school Vegas exclusivity, charm and quality with a modern dining spin.  If you go, ask for Israel.  Israel, a Las Vegas veteran, can recommend fine wines from the outstanding list as well as items not on the menu that are sure to combine for a memorable experience."

Everything from the food to the service I recalled was nothing short of excellent.   \n\nWe started off with the French Onion Gratin and Chicken Matzo Balls Soup.  Both were amazing, but if i had to pick I would order the French Onion soup only because I prefer delicate veggies in my soup.  Add some soggy bread and a thick layer of Gruyere cheese to that sweet beefy broth, and it will warm up any belly.\n\nI had the Pan Seared Foie Gras to myself, and as always an order is never enough.   I appreciate that they didn't unify the whole dish together because to me it's more enjoyable to build each bite than to dismantle to my preference.\n\nFor our main course we had the rich, savory Beef Ribs over a carrot mousselin.  It was so tender that we barely applied any pressure with a spoon to trim it.  To top off our entree off we order a Cream of Spinach and Mash Potatoes which is more like a Puree.  I think we could have done without the Spinach for as the whole meal was just too heavy.\n\nWe we're too full to order dessert, but they sent out a sorbet for us anyways.  Sweet!\n\n\n\nSecond time I came for their Steak Burger after all the reviews i read.  Seriously, wow. It was all that and a bag of chip!  My burger was cooked perfectly (med-rare), piled with bacon marmalade, topped with chopped crispy lettuce, and i think sliced tomatoes were up in the mix too.   \nI find the the additions of onions gave the burger an uncommon sweeter side yet still kept that smokey flavor.  Pick it up a few notches by adding their signature Barrymore Sauce (mixture of ketchup and A1 with a little more tang) and you'll be savoring each bite.  Don't be shy to dip your fries in the Barrymore Sauce too.  It's an all-purpose condiment! \n\nComes with a basket of herbs fries, a slice of dill pickle.  Worth the every penny at $13.5.\n\nI've been quite eager to share my new discovery with my friends.  Highly recommend this place to anyone."

It's a small steak house tucked away in the motel-like Royal Resort.  There are 10 tables in the restaurant area, and the menu screams classic steak house. Service is wonderful and attentive, as one would expect from a high-end steak restaurant. They also have specials like the \"Dean Martin\" (which included filet mignon and lobster tail) which just reinforces their Oldies throwback :)\n\nOnto the food. I hate to say, but I've definitely had better steak. The filet mignon I ordered was a little chewy, although it was cooked appropriately to medium, and it was not juicy :(  They do have lobster mac n cheese, which was rich and creamy and delicious, and they had a very common caesar salad. Their shrimp cocktail was quite impressive in size (3 very large shrimps) but overall, for the $$, I was unimpressed with the food quality. \n\nNext time I'd just come here for HH, enjoy the outside patio/ cool bar area and eat some apps.  It's a great spot for a date night or if you want to impress your boss ;)"

We got there a little early so we could have a drink in the bar- just our thing. The bar area is really small and a bit understated.\n\nThe main dining area was much more impressive.The food was great. They started us out with a nice selection of bread. We weren't tremendously hungry since we had a late afternoon snack of tuna carpaccio at a different restaurant so skipped the appetizers and salads. My husband had the filet and I had the lamb. Both were amazing! The lamb was seriously one of the best lamb dishes I have ever had.\n\nI was a bit disappointed with the selection of sides. We ordered sauteed spinach but there was no lobster mac and cheese on the menu so we ordered the mashed potatoes. They were good, but when my husband and I are looking to indulge, we want rich crab or lobster mac and cheese. The food was definitely 4/5 star.\n\nBut to the three-star rating. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. However, I wasn't sure if it was the sommelier or the manager that brought our wine out to us but he just had a snotty attitude. We had ordered a nice 2011 Ridge Zinfandel and when he brought it out we noticed it was a 2012 bottle. My husband said something and the sommelier/manager gave us a curt response that the 2012 was a better year anyway. He didn't reduce the price of the bottle, didn't ask if we would rather make another selection, just started opening the bottle. The wine was nice... but either way, I wasn't very impressed with the guy's attitude."

It was overpowered with spices. 2 stars. \n\nFor dessert we got the creme brulee and it was good. They put a scoop of basil lime sherbet on top and i thought it was horrible.

We were also completely IGNORED during our meal by our server and the manager that was trolling the dining room. So here goes...\n\nHappy hour at the Barrymore includes bottles of wine, so we bought one because the bartender was not hospitable to offer a cocktail. The hostess wished me a happy birthday and guided us to a plush booth in a room of 3 parties of guests = a total of 10 guests in the dining room, including us. It was romantic and inviting.\n\nOnce we were seated, the waiter arrived and noticed we already had a bottle of wine, picked up the bottle and stated, \"Oh I see you have wine already, you must have gotten here for happy hour.\"  I was a little taken aback by his comment, but I let it go. He suggested some appetizers (the two most expensive ones), announced the specials, and offered sparkling or still water. He never offered another bottle of wine, mind you our bottle was 3/4 empty by now. A couple of minutes passed and a female server arrived with bottled water: glass bottle of Evian, nice ($9-nice we later found out). \n\nAnother 10 MINUTES passed, while watching our server walk back and forth pass us, in addition to a suited man strolling the dining room, then our server returned to take our order. By this time, we were ready to order everything, appetizer and dinner, so we did. We decided on the octopus that came recommended, and I chose the salmon entr\u00e9e. Noted in the menu as \"pan-fried with crispy skin,\" the waiter warned me that the Barrymore cooks their salmon to \"medium\" and I was fine with that, in fact, I prefer it (I was later disappointed). The other entr\u00e9e we ordered was the squash curry. The waiter tried to upsell it by asking if we wanted to add shrimp or lobster. I didn't see that option in the menu anywhere, but whatever. We also opted for the creamed corn w/ lobster side dish, as recommended. I asked for bread before he left. Again, no attention taken to our now empty wine bottle or if we wanted more. \n\nA few minutes later, the same female busser? arrived with bread and butter. During this time, I noticed the suited man again strolling the dining room and watching each table. He didn't seem to engage very much or engage with anyone. He stopped at our table earlier and noticed our wine had not been poured for us, so he graciously refilled our glasses and left the empty bottle on the table without any conversation. WEIRD. The octopus appetizer was delivered to the table by our server and he announced what it was then left. Again, NO OFFERING OF MORE WINE OR DRINKS. The octopus appetizer was excellent. Octopus wasn't chewy at all, perfectly grilled and the vegetables were very tasty. We thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer, every last bit of it without any attention from our waiter. He never returned to see how it was or if we were satisfied. He did manage to bus the empty plate. The female busser? again returned and cleaned up our table, then reset it for dinner. \n\nAfter about 5-7 minutes, it was quick, dinner arrives and is brought to the table by the female who I am now sure was just a food runner. She was by far, the best person working there and I can't understand why she wasn't waiting tables. To recap, two more tables arrived during our dining period but one table also left leaving a total of 5 tables and now 14 guests in the dining room for our server. As we enjoyed our meal, I started to notice that the salmon was NOT cooked to medium, as previously announced. In fact, it was so dry that I had to spoon the sauce from the other meal we ordered in order to make it appetizing. The vegetables that accompanied the salmon were excellent and full of flavor; lots of colorful baby carrots and potatoes. The squash curry was good but REALLY lacked salt, it was very one-dimensional, and the vegetables were so finely diced that they resembled something you would use for a breakfast hash. It was also missing couscous. For $25, my salmon was oily and overcooked (and farm-raised at that); while for $22, the squash curry was disinteresting and unpleasant to look at. We completely finished our meal and were NEVER checked on by our server or the manager. Where does that happen? and why??\n\nWe were so unsatisfied that we had to bring it to the attention of the house and had a chat with the manager. He apologized and blamed it on the 20-person party they had on the cocktail patio. I didn't understand that or accept it. He offered dessert, I wasn't interested. He did comp our appetizer from the bill but I still feel it wasn't enough. We came for a special occasion and it was bad. We weren't treated with care or hospitality. The Barrymore left me bewildered. I won't be giving it a second chance or recommending it"

I finally got a chance to dine here this afternoon and I instantly forgot about all the past frustrations. \n\nI came in around 11:30am and got sat right away in the front parlor. With  large windows to my left, I had ample amounts of natural light to read and pace my meal. I have worked in many restaurants and feel like the Barrymore is one of the best with timing. They coursed out my meal with exceptional precision. The wait between each dish was minimal to almost nonexistent. Lindsey did a phenomenal job on checking up on me. She had this section by herself and it got busy halfway through my meal. At this point, the rest of the staff jumped in to remove finished plates and refill waters. \n\nI started off with a cocktail. The spring buzz was the perfect drink for this hot summer day. It is a mixture of Hangar One Wild Blueberry, K\u00fcbler Absinthe, ginger beer, fresh lemon, berry syrup. Hangar One is my favorite infused vodka. It can be served on the rocks and be easily appreciated. Barrymore, you had me at ginger beer. The drink was zippy, fresh, and light. I did not get a buzz from it, but was enamored with the bits of berries floating around from the house made syrup. \n\nA cocktail to sip, a book in hand, and a few minutes to kill before my french onion soup came out was the backdrop for a wonderful experience. Once the soup arrived, it was a cauldron of aromatic beauty. Dig past the layer of melted cheese and baguette leads to a bounty of caramelized onions in a rich broth. If I was in the comfort of my own home, I would have tipped the bowl over to get every succulent drop.\n\nA warm belly in the summer time does not always feel pleasant, but I was in a insouciant mood. Beads of sweat was making their way down my brow, but my bibb and heart of palm salad rectified that quickly. The combination of give from the heart of palm balanced the slight crisp from the lettuce and the smoother texture of the tomato and egg. There was no complaint about the creamy dressing. It did not weigh down the salad and was obviously homemade. \n\nThe previous two dishes was my attempt at being an appetizer yet I felt it could have been my whole meal in retrospect. Satisfaction had long washed over me, but a steakhouse burger was to come. I am on the search for the perfect burger and it was gratifying. The kitchen cooked it to a cool pink center. I had crossed the threshold of hunger into a whole new realm. I could not truly savor the multifaceted meal due to my state of excess, so packed up the remaining three quarters and called it a day. What I did taste was divine. The mix of frisee greens and the bacon marmalade with caramelized onions stood out against the more subtle gruyere cheese. The steak sauce on the side is a complimentary element to everything on the plate. Especially the seasoned fries. \n\nTapping out before dessert, I am given an excuse to come back and visit again. It was a pleasant experience from beginning to end."

None of us had a poor experience, but none of us had our minds blown either, hence the three star rating. This is only due to the prices being a bit steep for what you get. We were the first customers in the door at 5pm, and upon being seated, we did note that we had some time constraints due to our show. Surprisingly, despite being a recommended restaurant for people attending shows at the Smiths Center, they did not show any amount of urgency in getting our food out to us. The service was good, but not outstanding. As my boyfriend is a waiter that always goes above and beyond, I am a bit picky when it comes to service, so take that opinion with a grain of salt. Now for the food. \n\nThe complimentary bread basket may have been the highlight of the evening! lol\n\nApps:\n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad - this was the stand out dish of the night. The tomatoes were perfect and the burrata was delicious and creamy. \n\nMains: \n\nChilean Sea Bass - the fish was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the sauce was wonderful, but for almost $40, the portion was extremely small. The dish was served with grilled asparagus which was a bit mushy and unappetizing.\n\nFilet - my boyfriend was not happy with this at all! While the seasoning was okay, the steak was overcooked. He ordered medium rare and received a medium cook. He also ordered the special \"oscar\" crab topping. It was pretty bland and not enough crab for the additional $35 dollars it cost, which was almost as much as the steak itself. \n\nSides:\n\nSauteed Mushrooms - these were very good, and the portion was very generous. \n\nLobster Mac n' Cheese - meh, nothing special. It was pretty bland and could have used a little texture as well. \n\nDrinks: \nWe both got the Moscow Mule, these too were only okay. \n\nDesserts:\nUnfortunately, because our food took so long, we did not have time for dessert."

Chef John S. has done a wonderful job and kudos go out.\nThis is old school Vegas so if you're like me and tired of the cookie cutter joints around town, try Barrymore and impress your friends!\nLast visit, I tried filet on the specials. It was cooked perfectly and melted like butter. I also recommend the octopus appetizer."

After talking to a bunch of people on TripAdvisor, the Barrymore seemed to be the place to go. I was excited to try out their menu and had high hopes.\n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and the restaurant was empty. Completely empty. I guess we were fairly early (our reservation was for like 5:30, to allow time to eat and to get to our show) but it was a bit surprising. Our waitress was friendly and prmopt with service, chatty when it was appropriate and left us alone while we ate. I had a white russian to start (very good) and tried the foie gras appetizer and the scallops for my main. My boyfriend ended up getting the special 14 oz steak (the thing was at least an inch and a half thick, if not more.\n\nI love foie gras and I was really looking forward to trying the appetizer. I was underwhelmed, at best. Not only did I find my foie gras undercooked, but the spiced french toast that was served under it really didn't do anything to complement the richness of the foie gras. There was quite a bit of cinnamon and for me, it completely overpowered the foie gras. I wasn't a fan of the treatment of the dish here so I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something more savory.\n\nI think my main was a special for the evening because I don't see it on the menu, but the scallops I had were good, but not great. They too were slightly underdone and were way way way too salty. Shellfish doesn't usually need THAT much salt to get it where its going but it was salty to a point where I stopped eating after a point. Disappointing. My boyfriend enjoyed his gigantic steak, said it was the most tender steak he'd ever eaten but not the best steak he'd ever had.\n\nWe were all too full for dessert but our waitress did bring over some pistachio and raspberry macarons for my birthday dessert. These were quite good, but by this point, I was fairly disappointed in what was a relatively reasonably priced meal.\n\nOverall, this was an okay restaurant but for a special occasion, it really fell flat for me. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll steer clear of the Barrymore and try something different."

After frequenting the Royal House (the hotel bar) and appreciating the ambiance and style, I thought it would be nice to try the restaurant especially with all the rave reviews.  \n\nIt was a serious disappointment!  The food was mediocre, the service was lacking, and the decor was the only redeeming quality.  \n\nThe aged cowboy steak didn't have much flavor and was too fatty (the addition of the steak sauce was a minor improvement; unfortunately, it finally made its way to the table when we were almost finished eating) .  The steak sandwich was blah, and you can get a better burger at fuddruckers or smash burger.  The other food was really nothing to write home about.\n\nThe service was slow considering there were only six parties and the restaurant appeared to be at half capacity. The managers/owners(?) introduced themselves to every other table except ours (there were only five other tables in a small dining room). It took ten minutes for everyone at our table (of five) to be served their entrees, so half the food was cold by the time we could eat it.\n\nIf this restaurant is supposed to be nostalgic of old vegas, it really missed the mark!  Old Vegas is about good service, good food, and a good time!  If you're looking for a classic vegas steakhouse, go to the Golden Steer.  If you're looking for a similar style, go to the Artisan.  If you're looking for a good time, stay at the bar.\n\nAll in all the experience left a bad taste in my mouth!"

Overall, this is absolute crap food with crap drinks made with crap ingredients with crap service. For the same price range, just go with the tried and true and eat at Mastros or Bouchon or Craft.\n\nEverything at Barrymore felt low class from the moment we got there. Reservation was at 9pm. We arrive at 8:55pm. Hostess tells us they're behind, but didn't fail to suggest to us 3 different times in the same breath to grab drinks at the bar while we wait. We opted to wait in the tacky hotel lobby that was trying too hard to look like SLS/Bazaar.\n\nSeated at 9:30pm, outside. And, as it turns out, the rest of the country still smokes; and they all seem to be chainsmoking in Barrymore's patio. I asked if we could move inside, they inform me it'd take another 15-20 minutes. We suck it up and dine in smoke. \n\nDrinks: No distinction from bottled wine coolers. Simple syrup seemed to be the key ingredient. Thoughtless and unimaginative; what you would expect from TGI Friday's happy hour (no offense, TGIF). Go with the bottled beers--at least they can't mess those up. \n\nArtichoke appetizer: Overcooked beyond recognition--literally--we couldn't tell what the hell we were eating. Texture was so mushy it could've been mashed potatoes doused in oil. No resemblance to artichokes in any way shape or form.\n\nTruffle lobster mac & cheese: Taste was ok, but the texture of the cheese indicated subquality product (I have a feeling it evolved from powder). Promising name; lazily executed. \n\nRibeye: Unremarkable.\n\nFoie gras medallion with the steak: I blame this little piece of shit for putting us through this meal. It was not good; it tasted old and I suspect possibly previously frozen. Rubbery texture. \n\nYou know it's been a bad meal when the party skips dessert, which we did. You should skip this place altogether."

The Royal Resort, home of the Barrymore, is one such re-habbed and re-concepted hotel.  Others include the Plaza downtown and Treasure Island (now known as TI).\n\nAnyhow, the lobby is pretty cool, with a funky pooltable, shuffleboard, and a piano sitting around waiting for use.\n\nWhoever did the Barrymore has huge expectations for the space.  They definitely sunk a lot of dough into the place.  It is kind of an odd juxtapolition, actually, alongside the comparatively stark, bachelor-pad vibe of the lobby.\n\nThe menu is pretty cliched modern steakhouse with the requisite lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach, stone crabs on special.  Steaks are expensive and served a la carte, sides and sauces extra.  The room is small and a bit claustrophobic.  There were only a few tables in there at prime time and one was an obnoxious birthday party.  \n\nWhen you're forking over 38 bucks for a couple of lamb chops with no sauce or side and 50 bucks for 6 tiny \"floater\" stone crabs, you expect a certain level of decorum to be observed in the dining room.  The  screaming birthday table was not aware of this unwritten rule, unfortunately.  \n\nOh, well.  \n\nAlso, the prices were strip-level in spite of the location and the non-union labor.  Casino restaurants generally use union labor which costs about twice what non-union labor costs, hence the higher cost.  Also, they pay higher rents and higher build-out costs.  The Barrymore prices don't reflect their lower costs so I guess they expect to compete with the big boys in the casinos straight up based on quality and service.  Good luck with that.\n\nAnyways, the food was good.  The room was cool.  I like the funky location and hidden gem aspect.  I was torn between a 3 and 4 for this place.  I'm gonna bump em up to 4 just for the campy, old school vibe and the film-reel ceiling."

If, Indeed heredity is a factor in the mysterious art of acting, his credentials were impeccable. The Barrymores were the Royal Family of the American theatre along with his older siblings, brother Lionel and sister Ethel. Their father, British player Maurice Blythe, gave himself a name likely to impress the natives-and chose Maurice Barrymore. John Barrymore who acted in \"Hamlet\" had a liking for martinis and he would have six of them before dinner..never eat on an empty stomach was his saying. Christopher Plummer, who is most known for singing \"Edelweiss\" in the Musical  \"Sound of Music,\" portrayed John Barrymore, in an one-man play at the Elgin theater, in Toronto, that was later made into a feature film. I saw the DVD, the performance which won a 'TONY'  for Plummer, is most riveting one man performance ever. So much so, his co-star in \"Sound of Music' Julie Andrews, claims she saw it twice.\n\nThis eatery is named after the Barrymores and the ambiance is befitting of the name. It is located on a road that is less traveled, but made famous by the hyped up, high priced and snotty-Pieros (I had the worst Osso Bucco in this place, when I was naive and nerdy taking my romantic interest and shelling lot of dough to impress. I should have taken her to In and out burger,) on one end of the stretch. \n\nThere used to be a make shift theater-home to the people who had talent but no money for four walling in a casino-in the lobby of this Royal hotel, which is the official hotel for the Airlines flight crew I was told. One fine day the fire marshals came and took the whole place down and that was the end of the make-shift. \n\nThis place is jammed when the conventions are in town and rest of the time a decent  local crowd that frequent this joint not to mention attractive women sipping pina coladas at the bar and the tenders of male gender were openly flirting and ignoring the other customers. Flirting is a temptation but ignoring other customers is SIN ! punishable by one minus rating..\n\nThe lounge is tiny and you expect soft piano music, instead there were two burly guys in the corner making some loud music, which was distracting and not in line with the ambiance-one minus rating. The little patio is fire lit and there were too many fluffy cushions that took up the sofa we had to sit down on the floor cross legged ! We looked like two Hairy Krishna's!\n\nThe main room is tucked away for the classy clientele and this is probably the only elegant and private dining room outside a casino. The menu is short but eclectic. The burger I tried was the best I had in Vegas. It was neatly presented. You better ask for a table near a waiter, since the service is scant . This place is here to stay since the pricing and quality and ambiance can't be beaten and it is the best place East of the Strip but not far from the Strip."

A couple thicker pieces were not as tender, but very flavorful. The citrus sauce on top was quite good, and the fava beans were excellent. \n\nMy wife had the Muscovy Duck, which she liked. It came with heirloom carrots and we got a couple sides. Brussels sprouts and asparagus.  The asparagus was fresh but otherwise unremarkable. The sprouts were covered with bacon, so there's that!  \n\nI had the bone-in ribeye with bleu cheese. I ordered it medium, as many reviewers indicated theirs were more rare than ordered. What I got was a medium-rare steak that was nearly perfect. My only issue was the portions were huge, even the duck, and we couldn't finish everything. It pained me to let that beautiful meal go unfinished. I don't suppose that's something to complain about, though. \n\nSo, with drinks, an appetizer, two sides, and two entrees, we paid around $195 with tip. We would definitely return."

And the food wasn't *bad*, I just didn't think it matched the niceness of the decor.  People's comments about the building's exterior were spot-on...dumpy from the outside but chic on the inside.  Loved the fireside patio, even though we didn't use it (in 100 degree heat haha). Have fun!"

The dining room is beautiful, movie reels on the ceiling, tufted royal blue booths, subtle and sexy lighting, and a small but stylish bar.  The decor harkens back the days of old Hollywood when glamour, tact and elegance were the rule of the day, not plunging v-necks and teenie boppers driving Lambos.  The patio beckons for an after-dinner cigar expertly paired with a glass of Willett rye.  Great cocktail menu and wine list curated by a well-informed and personable somm.  Don't even get me started on the food, you should just go see for yourself.  A perfect end to a long day at the Nightclub and Bar convention.  I'll definitely be back."

At first, it seemed like we picked a terrible night for it--the place was jam packed with a huge group all wearing t-shirts akin to those smut peddlers on the strip. Luckily, their party moved outside to the piano and we seized our opportunity to grab seats at the bar.\n\nAfter a quick glance at the drink menu, I went for their namesake drink, The Barrymore. I thought it would taste like the Twin Creeks Manhattan thanks to orange marmalade being one of the ingredients. I was right. It was pretty close and I enjoyed every last drop along with every last ice cube.\n\nI'm already a fan of The Royal House and this is just one more reason to visit."

Making a reservation was very simple and when you pull up the outside definitely does not match the inside.\n\nThe restaurant is in a resort used, I believe, as time shares.  Once you walk in you feel like you are in a very hip...very upscale spot.  Once you take the corner to the seating area it's a whole new vibe.  It's very Mob sexy with an old \"Casino\" vibe.  I couldn't stop looking around because of how well put together it is.  The d\u00e9cor was by far the highlight of my night.\n\nI was already hungry so everything on the menu was looking amazing.  The Foie Gras was sold out so I was a little sad.  My boyfriend and I decided to share the lobster and steak because it was recommended for two by our server.  Our girlfriend got the sea bass.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and a cocktail.  When our server came back to the table he asked to take our order...AGAIN.  When we told him he was just at our table he apologized.  He brought over water 10 minutes later.  When he came back with our bottle of wine and asked if we knew about the dinner specials this evening...that he already went over when he took our food order.\n\nWhen our dishes finally came he decided to ask us to move our plates and glasses that he sat down to lay the tray with the lobster tails and our steak.  It was very awkward and weird.  If your surf and turf platter is bigger than the actual table you may want to evaluate your dishes...or a pop up tray to sit between us.  \n\nOur steak was requested medium rare and was presented well done.  Not a big issue for us but when you charge as much as they do and there are literally only 10 tables in the restaurant it shouldn't be an issue.  Meat on both lobster and steak were dry and appetizer portion.  Our girlfriend's sea bass on the other hand was amazing which priced less than my she crab soup.\n\nWhen the bill came it was a bit overpriced for the service and quality of food.  I get what they are trying to do and I applaud them but for amateur service and not a great portion or quality of food I would have rather spent $500 for three people somewhere else."

It's going to be the next big thing on the Vegas restaurant scene and with very few tables, once the word gets out this restaurant will be extremely difficult to get into very very soon. The restaurant officially opens on September 17th, but right now they are having what they call in the biz a \"soft opening.\" The Barrymore is located in the lobby of the Royal Resort, it is the perfect compliment to the cool and hip vibe that the Royal House lounge has presented us with this year.  \n\nThe decor of the Barrymore is phenomenally beautiful and everything from the food to the service is top notch (a big shout out to our server Israel who is amAAAzing at what he does)! We had the lobster mac and cheese, the lobster deviled eggs, tuna nicoise salad, the burger and for dessert, drum roll please.... the best freaking s'mores EVER MADE!!!  Every single dish was a flavor quest in my mouth and I think this place may have spoiled me forever! Also quick tip: try their signature cocktail The Barrymore, it's got orange marmalade in it and the $7 glass of prosecco ain't too shabby either! All in all The Barrymore is a carefully crafted experience that will delight and surprise you at every turn!"

Before we even got there we were waiting in the cab line at our hotel and the man there asked us, \"Where to?\" When we told him the Barrymore he said he loved it and that we would have an amazing dinner. He was absolutely spot-on.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were both surprised that the restaurant is actually not huge. And I was a little nervous going into the lobby that maybe we didn't choose the right place --it was Sunday night and there weren't many people around--but we had an amazing time. We were seated more or less right away so we didn't get a chance to hang at the restaurant bar but maybe next time.\n\nI love the decor of this place -- like everyone says, it's very old-Las Vegas. The booths are really big and really make this place. We sat at a table and our waitress was absolutely lovely. Very attentive and wonderful talking with us about the food. I had their version of a moscow mule to start and it was big! Copper mug and everything, I was happy!\n\nThe three-course dinner was so reasonably priced we just had to go with it, and we did the wine pairings as well. With my mule I started out with a good amount to drink! But the wines were great with each course and the food was excellent.\n\nWe don't go to Vegas much, so I imagine when we come back we'll try to visit somewhere different to get a little more variety, but it actually makes me a bit sad--I'd love to return to the Barrymore! If you're on the fence about choosing this restaurant -- just go, you won't regret it!"

The atmosphere is exceptional. Old film reels line the ceiling in the main dining area and the surrounding aesthetics compliment with a feel from yesteryear.\n\nThe food is consistently 4 star quality-- with the occasional 5 star standout and the less occasional 3 star encounter. The menu changes seasonally, but I've had a lot of love for the fish entr\u00e9es and as a result haven't ventured too far from those options as a main course goes. More memorable though, have been some of the starters. Their Foie Gras used to come with peach gobbler and more recently it has been Pan Seared and accented with clementine confit and citrus jus. They do a good job of pairing it with fruits that enhance the natural flavors of the foie. The octopus has a beautiful texture and taste. Lobster Mac & Cheese isn't usually my favorite, but I liked sharing it here specifically because of the truffle essence and mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce. We enjoyed the Steak Tartare with pickled shimeji mushroom and quail egg. The mushrooms were a pleasant, rightfully earthy addition, but generally speaking wasn't as memorable as some of the other options.\n\nThey also make quality drinks at The Barrymore. Their menu is dominated with white spirits and a good selection of gin, but I have had a couple real nice whiskey based drinks after talking to the bartender for a bit.\n\nWhile I would come in for the food, the setting has consistently been the impetus for my return visits...I am a sucker for nice ambiance though. Still, this isn't my choice for a romantic meal, just for special/memorable experiences."

I ate about half of the second steak but didn't finish because of the strings of fat running through the steak.

Or to take a date if you didn't want them looking around the room at other people (there aren't likely to be any) I did see some escort-looking types coming out of the hotel elevator, which makes the curious part of me want to return for happy hour, see if I was right.. \n\nIn general, I really liked the place, it's one of those spots you'll feel 'in' that you know about."

Foodies love it because it's actually good without trying too hard, it's not expensive, and no one really knows about it.  Similar to when the food trucks started out. I felt like one of the few and knew I had to try it. Groupon sealed the deal.\n\nThis restaurant had none of the pitfalls of other new restaurants: No mass hoards of people, no terrible service, no huge waits, not even cold butter and hard bread or the usual \"we'll be back once they settle in\". \n\nIn other words: The restaurant was as it should be.\n\nWhy 3 stars? The whole app list was shellfish & fish intensive- 8/10 apps. I like apps to see what the restaurant can do creatively on the cheap.  No such luck.\nThe entrees all sounded the same, so much so, the only item worth choosing was the SteakBurger. A burger at dinner, the Horror, I know.  The frisee on the burger gave it a bitter taste, the onion marmalade gave it a sweet taste and the gruyere gave it a musty taste. It was just not doing it for me.  When people say English Muffin bread you think the b-fast toast, but it's closer to a warm Foccaia type softness and airiness. Overall, this burger was a conundrum.\n\nThe dessert list (all $8.50) actually had apple pie with sorbet on top! That didn't even read right. We got ricotta cheesecake, which, read better than it looked. A half-circle of cheesecake with a sprinkling of graham cracker crumbs on top served on the cheapest of plates. \n\nQuaint dining room, stellar service, but throw darts at the menu when choosing because I'm sure it's all good."

However, once you step into the Barrymore, you are transformed into a swanky, 1960's Mad Menish, restaurant. They really should move to a hotel that fits its class and style.\n\nI made reservations for 7:30 PM in order to give my friends and I ample time for a nearby 9:30 show. However, we weren't seated until 8:10. The hostess profusely apologized and the manager even came to our table and offered us a free appetizer. We all looked at the menu for 10 seconds, not sure what appetizer to get, but he said \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you.\" 10 minutes later, THREE appetizers came out and they were all delicious. We got the roasted artichoke, roasted heirloom beets, and the lobster mac and cheese (MUST HAVE if you like mac and cheese). Maybe I should come here more often and pray that there is a delay just to get free appetizers. \n\nAs for our entrees, all three of my friends had great dishes (sorry forgot what they ordered) but my Diver Scallop entree tasted as if the chef accidentally dropped a bottle of salt into my dish. I made my friends try it, just to make sure I wasn't being overly critical, and one of my friends actually spit it out because it was too salty. I wanted to return the dish, but we were already running late and I didn't want to cause more trouble! I'm not sure if that's how the dish is supposed to taste, but if it is, it's waay too salty for me and my friends. \n\nOverall, the manager is great, the atmosphere is sexy and posh, and the food is generally tasty."

The Barrymore is off the strip in a hotel I have never heard of. \n\nWhen I pulled up to the hotel for dinner on Mother's Day it was completely empty. Before entering you see The Barrymore sign with lights surrounding it and fire below it. \n\nThe three of us were seated at a booth that was both comfortable and spacious. The restaurant is very intimate and great for conversation.\n\nFirst, the waitress brought out a bread basket which had pretzel bread, parmesan crackers, and epi baguette. The pretzel bread was the star, it may have been the best thing I put in my mouth all night.\n\nI chose two appetizers as my main course; the caesar salad and the rock shrimp carbonara. Others at the table ordered duck muscovy; mashed potatoes; squash curry. The waitress brought out the caesar salad first. Salad was crisp and fresh, dressing contained too much mayonnaise; croutons were an after thought. I am not usually a huge fan of shrimp, but the rock shrimp here was cooked and seasoned well. However the sauce tasted nothing like a carbonara, it tasted more like a garlic butter sauce. The presentation of this dish was almost there except for the pieces of bacon thrown on the plate. The bacon was unnecessary when there was already chunks of bacon in the dish.\n\nFor dessert, I asked the waitress for her recommendation and said her favorite was the chocolate raspberry tart. After reading the description I didn't know whether it was a tart or a flourless chocolate cake. She said it should say flourless chocolate crumbs which are surrounding the tart. I decided to go with her recommendation even though I normally regret listening to suggestions from the wait staff. The presentation of this dish was the best part. All the flavors were mediocre. The tart itself was not crunchy enough and had no flavor. The raspberry part tasted like a store bought raspberry jam. \n\nOverall, the best thing about this restaurant is the retro decor along with an intimate setting."

Admittedly, it's in a peculiar location. I mean, come on. The Royal Resort of Las Vegas is hardly Steve Wynn's place, and it's not even the Marriott brothers' place. It looks like a funky smaller hotel, and that's what it is, full of Damon Runyonesque characters, hangers-on to Jay-Z, and barefoot folks sprawled on lobby couches texting away. A throwback look, with a grand piano in the lobby, too.\n\nThe restaurant, though, is absolutely lovely. Slick bar with another motley crew of characters, attractive digs, and two dining rooms. Both packed on a Monday night. Impressive, you Yelpers.\n\nThe experience could have veered toward five star territory if not for a few glitches. To the Barrymore's credit, they went out of their way to make the glitches right, which was impressive as hell. First glitch? too-low lighting in one of the dining rooms, which happened to be the one in which we were seated. Fortunately, companion's eyes work better than mine. (I have other redeeming qualities). Our waitress Kendra M. not only came with her own business card, but with an extensive knowledge of the menu and a great melange of alt-looks and serious professionalism. \n\nOpened with two drinks between us A perfect margarita and an even more perfect vodka martini. Whatever olives they're using in the martini should be patented. That martini was spectacular.\n\nWe started with the famed mac and cheese with lobster; it lived up to its tasty billing if not being particularly chunkified in the lobster department. Fois gras tasty. Breads warm and fresh. And it looks like we're rolling, right? She gets the duck, I order the NY strip streak....and a filet mignon comes out.\n\nWell, not only did Kendra apologize and bring both back, so the right steak could be done right and the meal served at the same time, but the maitre d' stopped by, too. We were forgiving, but they acted like it was a personal failure that they were going to repair.\n\nAnd they did.\n\nNot only were the main courses brilliant -- maybe the best steak of the last year -- but they brought us two desserts and a glass of Remy. \n\nYou gotta like that. Thanks, Kendra. \n\nA couple of tips:\n\na. if the eyes are an issue, ask to be seated in the brighter dining room when you book your table.\nb. don't panic if there's a big group in the second dining room. Acoustics were fine; we could talk just fine\nc. The house zin a bit hit and miss. Probably opt for the malbec or a cab.\n\nWe're so coming back here sometime. This was a wonderful meal and a wonderful experience. It ain't cheap, but sometimes you really do get what you pay for."

We had also gotten a salad to start off because we were starving - something light because as I said, I get full on whatever comes out first haha We had also ordered some drinks. I would recommend just getting something on the rocks if you want to catch a buzz.

Right down the street from the Las Vegas Convention Center, Piero's, and Tacos del Gordo. Across from the Peppermill, if you want to dine like an aristocrat, eat where the early mafia leaders in Las Vegas ate while these bosses were being the city in the early days of Nevada."

            "review": "Stick a flag in the Barrymore, everyone.  Put it on permanent bookmark because this is the best restaurant in Las Vegas.  Part classical steakhouse/part French bistro with a mixologist-designed drink menu and a classic Vegas/contemporary hipster feel.  It's cool.  It's tasty.  It's just plain great.\n\nWhen tourists hit Vegas, they often try out the stylish restaurants on the Strip, hoping for unique flavors and a meal they will talk about long after they've flown home.  Vegas locals know, though, that the best chance at that kind of meal is often hidden off the Strip on other Vegas streets.  My vote for the most memorable meal in Vegas is the Barrymore.  While the will tourists hit French restaurants and steakhouses on the strip for $100+ a person meals, the Barrymore is quietly the best classically upscale restaurant in Vegas at more moderate price (although still not cheap).\n\nAppetizers: classic options with interesting taste twists.  \nThe panzanella (Tuscan tomato salad): tart and sweet and delicious with vinegary marinated heirloom tomatoes topped with burrata cheese (that appears to be homemade) and fried bread pieces (not dried out croutons--lightly fried bread pieces).  Put it all together and it's brilliant.\nRoasted Heirloom Beets: roasted beets and goat cheese should be officially married after tasting this dish.  They are perfectly paired. \n\nThe Dinner: steakhouse options and various rich dinner options.\nDuck confit: served with risotto, this dish should be award-winning--rich and flavorful and tender. The risotto is all flavor and buttery with truffle flavor on top.  The amount of duck served is small, but the flavor is so rich that you won't mind the choice of quality over quantity as the duck meat falls off the bone.\nScallops with curried cauliflower: another perfect pairing.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and topped with a delicious and tart cilantro sauce.\nAsparagus side: grilled expertly--still crisp, but roasted long enough to bring the flavor to the surface.\n\nThe bar is worth a visit on its own.  The martini menu is a page long and has some delicious blends.  Fans of mixology will love this place.\n\nAnd back to the food.  Save room for the tiramisu when you come here.  It is a unique take on the classic dessert--with the marscapone filling a cup with lady fingers and a coffee-flavored biscotti."

There's no place around that shows less appreciation for an over $1,500 dinner bill.

The music and the decor remind you of the original Las Vegas, from the late 1950s to early 1960s. The food was simply outstanding. My wife and I shared the 18 ounce bone in ribeye. It was so good, that my wife literally picked up the bone and started gnawing on it like a rabid wolf. I'm not kidding. You should also try the lobster creamed corn. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. We have been to many of the high-end restaurants in Las Vegas, and the Barrymore competes favorably with all of them."

The parking is very convenient for the Royal Resort. The restaurant is located just off the lobby area and it too was pretty desolate on a Saturday around noon. I understand since this is mainly known as a dinner location, so I gave them a pass there. \n\nThe hostess greeted us warmly and seated us in the side dining area. There are three areas for dining, the main room, the outside area and the side area. The decor is delightful. I love the retro Hollywood feel. \n\nOur server was fantastic. He was very welcoming and friendly. He made recommendations and was very warm and conversational, telling us all about the restaurant and insisting on taking us on a tour of the other dining rooms after our meal. My fella and I started with the lobster mac n cheese and also got the steak frites and the steakhouse burger. The flavors were fantastic. Both of our entrees had slightly too many carmelized onions on them for my taste, but the meals were great. Our favorite dish was definitely the lobster mac n cheese. The flavors were phenomenal. We were literally licking the bottom of our bowl. The burger and steak sandwich were great as well. The bun wasn't my favorite so I ate the burger and toppings on their own. \n\nAfter our meal, we were taken on the promised tour of the restaurant and I was utterly impressed with the fantastic service at the Barrymore. I can't wait to return to try all that their dinner menu promises. Love this place."

Having had both lunch and dinner at The Barrymore, I can assure you the food and the service are just as lovely.  Our lunch party of 4 enjoyed every morsel of our repast.  We were seated in the smaller dining area.  Our sandwiches were accompanied by mini fry baskets filled with perfectly crisp french fries.  Apple pie for dessert had a yummy buttery crust; thoroughly delicious.\n\nFor dinner, we were seated in the main dining room, in one of the plush curved booths along the wall (so retro!  I loved it!) and were attended by two friendly and very competent waiters.  We ordered cocktails which were perfectly prepared, followed by wine service provided by the house sommelier.  He gave a good recommendation and presentation; however, we never saw him after that as the waiters did the rest of the wine-pouring for the evening.  The French onion gratin soup was quite possibly the best I have ever tasted in my life.  Diver scallops over oxtail stew were luscious.  The short rib was so tender, like buttah!  The pasta dish consisted of a generous portion of homemade pasta with a veal/beef/pork bolognese sauce and ricotta.  My husband ate the whole thing.\n\nPear creme brulee was true custardy deliciousness, which we enjoyed with our capuccinos.\n\nI understand they've only been open for a couple of months which probably explains why the dining room only had 4 tables of guests that evening.  Once word gets out, though, they're going to have a line going out the Royal Resort door!"

Sometimes, grandmas recipes can be improved upon but sometimes its best to leave a classic alone.\n\nThe seared foie with a vanilla French toast and cherry chutney is perfectly balanced and delicious.  Use the toast to mop up the foie fat and wow, the flavors are sublime.  Successful reinvention!  Then there is the steak tartare with a lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche and an olive tepenade that mask the raw beef flavor and instead heighten the metallic flavor. Eek.\n\nFor mains, top props to the fried free range chicken drizzled with a honey-sherry glaze.  Juicy, crispy, and a finger licking good sweet / acidic glaze.  The crispy Korean style pork belly is OK.  The accompanying kimchee fried rice is not.  Flat flavor and oily.\n\nFinally, the steaks, the servers claim their prime but they are definitely not top prime or well aged.  A little tough.  A little lacking in beefy goodness. \n\nService is very good.\n\nNice selection of wines.  The 50 under $50 list is well chosen and offers some good value.  The Captains List has some great finds if you are willing to look but the lack of organization and obscene overpricing of top wines make it hard for any connoisseur to take seriously ('00 Mouton $2900 [$1200 over retail], '00 Lafite $5800 [$3300 over retail]).\n\nThe Barrymore fills the void, providing a Strip like, exclusive dining experience without the Strip prices or hassle.  Is it worth it?  That's for you to decide."

It's not the Wynn or Encore but a hotel I've never seen or heard of. What is this place?\n\nWe walked into the restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. It was classier and more intimate than I had anticipated.  Whew! The decor was very old Vegas. We got a booth...it was nice, plush and comfy. The service was great and our server was very attentive.\n\nWe started the evening with white sangria and a Honey Badger (muddled strawberries, club soda, lemon, honey Bourbon). I really enjoyed the Honey Badger. We got a complimentary veggie plate and bread. For our appetizer, we got the Pan-seared Foie Gras which is on top of peach cobbler with pecans and creme anglaise. The sweet yet tangy peach cobbler cuts down the richness of the foie gras - a nice contrast of flavor and texture. I got a medium rare filet mignon, my friend got a medium rare ribeye. To accompany our steaks, we got the Lobster Mac n Cheese, Cream Corn with Lobster. The steaks were simple and cooked to perfection. They know how medium rare is supposed to be. Pink, juicy and tender. The Lobster Mac and cheese and the cream corn with lobster were ok but definitely lacked lobster. You can count the small bits of lobster.\n\nWe were so full to even order dessert. But since it was my birthday, they gave me free dessert anyway. One was a lemon olive oil sorbet and the other was apricot sorbet. Fresh tasting and refreshing but we just couldn't finish them. We had to get a double shot of espresso to keep us awake. Then a plate of macarons came: raspberry and pistachio. They were good and had perfect shell and feet. It was a great evening!"

I don't know how they sear it without it just disintegraing.  The lamb was wonderful, as well as the kobe beef pasta special they had that evening.  Great atmosphere.  Don't necessarily trust open table though.  It said we could only get a 9.15 and we walked over there and were sat at 8.05."

They had a great  singer belting out Sinatra tunes and the place is small enough to not get too lost.  A very simple menu of fish and steaks and a good selection of cocktails.  Very old Vegas feel with really good food.  We had the seared fois gras, Caeser salad, steaks and lots of sides.  A great meal for the price."

Saturday night - around 6ish and we're basically the only people there ( one other guy at the bar drinking a diet coke . ) I get the fact that it's early for weekend dinner in Vegas standards but from what i understand, they are trying to get local biz as much, if not more from the tourist/convention folk so i'm concerned - granted they are just getting started but ... well, enough of the negativity.  I like the place, i like the vibe and i hope this place kicks ass.\n\nThe Drinks ?  damned if i remember what they were but they were stiff and cost about $11 ( give or take a $1 .  Sorry, I know, I'm useless ) \n\nThe food ?  I like that they went ahead and split the burger and fries for us.  And yes, the burger was perfectly cooked AND salted to my liking and i'm glad they used MAYO and the meat tasted great !  I was kinda surprised the burger only cost $13.50 - much cheaper than Holstein's - i gotta believe it's the same meat but dang, i'd swear the meat tastes better at The Barrymore !\n\nThe mac and cheese - well, it happened again ! I get sucked into the lobster mac and cheese every time i see it on a menu cause it sounds AWESOME .  But after i start eating it, I bitch about it.  why ?!  Because i feel lobster should either be eaten straight up or with some butter - that's it, that's all .  As much as i liked this mac n cheese, i still feel the lobster gets lost a little and lobster should never get lost ! \n\nService was great, and for sure, i will try again for breakfast and dinner.\n\nsorry, thought i took pics but i screwed up - i video'd the food !"

            "review": "*3.5 Stars*\n\nWe decided to try the Barrymore after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. The Royal Resort is actual a cute little place on the inside. The Barrymore was decorated nicely. We had a drink at the bar before dinner and then we were seated by the window. Um...let's just say, I would have rather not been seated by the window. The Barrymore is in a less than desirable location behind the strip. I had a view of a giant Ross, and the back of the Circus Circus. No thanks. I believe the ambiance of our dinner would have been much nicer had we been seated somewhere else. It ruined it a little for me. \n\nNow on to the food. They brought out some bread and butter to start off with. Parmesan crisps, French bread and some pretzel bread with bacon and cranberries that was delicious. The flavor combo in that bread was insane. We ordered the mussels for our appetizer and they were very good, they had a nice sauce and some grilled bread to sop it up with. \n\nFor our entrees, I order the strip steak with a baked potato and my husband ordered the seared ahi. First off, let me say, I ordered my steak medium and it was almost rare. I don't have a problem with rare, I just prefer medium. It was seasoned very well and tender but I would have preferred it to be cooked longer. After a few bites, rare is a little difficult for me to eat. The baked potato was uneventful and I wish I would have saved my $6 dollars and the calories. My husband's ahi was delicious. I would recommend that dish.  We ended with the ricotta cheesecake and the sorbet. \n\nI was a little disappointed in the cheesecake, it was good but it was tiny. We each had one bite each, it wasn't even half a piece. The sorbet was good, it tasted a little like Thrifty's to me. \n\nAll in all it was a solid meal. The service was a little weird, we had ordered a meal to go and they forgot, and they switched servers mid-meal. But our server was very nice and gave a good recommendation for a wine to go with my steak that was tasty and well-priced. Don't get me wrong, The Barrymore was very good and we may try it again. It was just lacking the wow factor that I look for when I go out for a nice meal."

It was ok; I was disappointed in the choice of using mayo instead of eggs, but that's not too much of a concern.  The divers' scallops were an issue.\n\nThey came out overcooked (it was rubbery in texture), I took one small bite (probably 20% of the medallion) and sent it back.  They had no issues with it.  What was the issue was that the second dish came out undercooked.  If I had to pick a poison, I'd pick the latter, which I ate; but the core of the medallion was luke-warm in temp at best.  I've cooked scallops that size; it ISN'T that hard to do to get em just right, and I'm not even the cook of my household.  I really hated to have to sent it back because it takes a while to grow scallops to the size of those things and now 1 if not  3 just got wasted for no reason.  The ox tail stew reminds me of some of the beef jerky I've had.  Way too salty, way too chewy.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a \"crispy\" pork belly.  The skin wasn't crispy, actually according to her words no part of that meat was crispy at all.  The piece was too dry as well and not tender.  It was also overseasoned.\n\nWe went with our friends who recommended it.  I REALLY wanted to like it, because the service was absolutely excellent, but the food really left us disappointed."

The location or area of the restaurant is unsophisticated with a Ross superstore across the street. The hotel is an old school vibe, a bit low end. The Barrymore is an interesting old style Vegas with a classic velvet feel. The serving staff was excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly.  We started with a dirty blue chees stuff olive martini ... somehow it was not done well. I'm not sure why, but it seemed off. We order the Duck Foie Gras and Lobster bisque to start. Both had a nice presentation, however the taste seemed lacking on both. I can't say why, but it just did not come together well.  Next we ordered the bone in rib eye steak and braised short ribs. The short ribs was a major disappointment! Again a nice presentation, but  the short ribs were dry and crusted around the outside... tuff or a little burnt might be a bit more accurate description.  The center was soft and juicy... the sauce was thick and basic! The root vegetable mirepoix was greasy and had an unpleasant flavor. The bone in rib eye steak was gritty, low on flavor, and poor on marbling. The meal was $180 for 2. It was a major disappointment. At these prices, Vegas has so much more to offer with a truly amazing experience. I recommend a pass on The Barrymore."

It actually took some more than necessary convincing before our waiter finally relented that we did not in fact order those drinks, nor had we ordered anything yet!\n\nWhen our cocktails did arrive, the uneventful HillBilly beef brisket infused Bloody Mary was accompanied by a wedge of last week's dry and tired lime, The Lonnie martini was fortunately garnish-less and pleasant.\n\nOne of the things that generates a vast culinary sadness in me is an bad bread experience, and what arrived was a whole basketful of it.

The service is amazing and friendly which is hardly found on the strip.  Every dish I've ever had is amazing, especially the creamed corn/lobster and bacon  and the braised short ribs!  Had the ribeye this time and it was cooked perfect!  Atmosphere is great, and every employee including the Manager is professional welcoming.  What i like is that most people eating here come dressed decent and not the usual Vegas casual attire.  One thing I hate is going to a so called upscale place on the strip and seeing people in Jeans and a designer T-shirt.  I just hope The Barrymore upholds everything they currently due and does not fall into the habit of changing for the masses or the \"at the moment\" trends so often found in this town!!  If I had to give one suggestion it would be keep the blinds closed until sundown.  First time I went was in the winter so it was already dark and the view was nice with the torches and city lights.  But this time was last week around 6:30 and it was still light out, sat by the window and had to look out onto the street and buildings.  But other than that minor thing this is my one of my top 2-3 places to dine in Vegas!!!"

He had another bottle in his hand he said was a wine of similar style. Stupidly, we said OK. It was not very good.\n\nWe had the shrimp cocktail. Not as good as we remember.The shrimp was OK and the sauce was fairly bland and mild. I remember it having some heat last time.\n\nMy guest had the sea bass. We were underwhelmed. I had a $48(!) steak. Ok, but very dry. not worth anywhere near the price, but I guess that's the going rate in Vegas.\n\nWaiter really pushed the creamed corn w/ lobster. We had the lobster mac and cheese last time and it was good. The creamed corn had very little lobster and was, well, creamed corn. My mistake.\n\nOn the plus side the bread basket had 3 types of bread which were all delicious.\n\nNice ambiance except for perhaps the strange piano/singer lounge act performing standards + 70s rock ballads. Weird.\n\nBill was almost $200. Would give 3 stars but can't do it for these prices. Not planning on going back."

It is just off the strip in a smaller hotel with a door almost completely hidden into the trim. The atmosphere is old school Vegas cool.\n\nI started with the veal sweetbreads with bone marrow panisse which were absolutely delicious. The rich, fatty sweetbreads had a beautiful browning to the exterior and their richness was tempered with the panisse. My wife started with the lobster mac and cheese with truffle, mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce. Also fantastic. Definitely not the mac and cheese you remember as a kid.\n\nFor the main course, I opted for the evening's special, a Delmonico steak. It was seasoned and seared nicely on the outside and cooked perfectly to medium rare. For sides I ordered the cream corn and lobster with bacon as well as the creamed spinach. The cream corn was delicious as is and the creamed spinach did need a little salt and pepper.\n\nMy wife opted for the Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken with white asparagus risotto and saut\u00e9ed pea tendrils. She shared a bit with me and it was also wonderful. The chicken was moist inside but the skin was crisped nicely. The risotto was creamy and rich. She absolutely loved it.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Passion Fruit Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with raspberry lemongrass salad and toasted coconut sorbet. The creme brulee was tart, but pairing it with the coconut sorbet balanced the dessert out nicely.\n\nThis is probably one of my top 5 favorite places to eat on the planet and I will be sure to make reservations every time I'm in Vegas."

Reasonably priced at $48 per person - for 3 courses.  We had reserved well in advance, but still got stuck with the table right at the door of the dining room, in the middle of the room, with the hallway and wine wall as our backdrop - not exactly the best seat in the house - with staff buzzing by constantly.  And the guy sitting to the side taking photos with a flash almost our entire meal - sorry dude that is RUDE, I feel like they should have told him, no flash photography, it was so annoying.\n\nOur waitress was the same one we had in February and the place wasn't that full - so not sure why the service was so average.  She really checked in like a waitress would at Dennys.  And the other attendants were pretty negligent.  My son ordered a bottle of sparkling wine and they only brought out 3 glasses, since 3 people spoke up, that they would have some - when I think they should have just given everyone a glass.  They poured the 3 glasses and then put the bottle behind my son, out of his reach across the walk way and there it sat.  We had 3 empty glasses most of the meal - and despite our repeated stares the staff just walked by - not serving the last of the wine until the end of the meal.  My husband ordered the wine pairing with his meal and they were behind getting the wine out with each course and there was no explanation.  At Valentines the wine steward came over each course and told us what we were drinking.\n\nFirst course - the pumpkin quail soup - interesting - had a hard time figuring out the proper way to eat a whole quail sitting in the middle of the soup.  When we did get a piece of quail meat off - it was yummy with the pumpkin soup, but the soup wasn't very hot, so it could have been much better.  The soup bowls had a big lid that 3 out of the 4 servings had taken away when the soup was served, but one lid got left on the soup and we didn't know what to do with it.  They never noticed this big white lid sitting on the table!  It should have been removed.  The rolls and bread here are FANTASTIC - we could have just eaten them and been very satisfied!\n\nTurkey, stuffing, puree yams, mashed potatoes, and green beans - all were average - nothing exceptional - meat and stuffing were both dry and all my pieces had ribbons of fat through them.  Never been a yam fan.  Potatoes I love and these were just OK.  Green beans were good.  Gravy came on the side and again was not hot enough to make up for luke warm food.  We mostly took our food home as it seemed a waste to not eat it, but no one was gobbling it down at the restaurant.  My daughter had shrimp pasta - and the shrimp were giant - however they were like rubber!  Auntie and brother both tried the shrimp and said - \"no, not good\" and took no more bites.  The pasta and sauce were fine.  Our ending with pumpkin tart was also not satisfying - but we all love a rich pumpkin pie and this was on the light side.\n\nWe might go back or maybe not - there are so many excellent restaurants in the city - and we loved the Barrymore the first time, but you only get one strike in this town and you are out.  Sorry."

I even tried what was thought to be a simple shrimp cocktail but in reality was a colossal appetizer fit for a meal.\n\nThe service is supreme and the adult libations will surely take you back to the classier times of Las Vegas."

My girlfriend and I each were very happy with the entire dining experience and are already planning on returning with friends!\n\nWe each started off with a cocktail. I had The Barrymore which featured Gentleman Jack and we both agreed that it was very tasty with mellow notes of whisky followed with a nice citrusy finish, a very manly drink. Amber had the Spring Buzz which featured Hangar one wild blueberry, the taste that I had was very enjoyable no real notes of alcohol just a very fresh taste. I could see myself consuming entirely too many of these around a pool.\n\nWe started with the Grilled Octopus which was amazing, I really don't know how to describe this dish it's that amazing!  It is a MUST HAVE for any dinner here.\n\nWe then ordered the Pan Seared Foie Gras as our \"second course\" NomNomNom!  We don't always eat delicious delicious goose/duck liver, but I will say this was the best I've ever had. The lovely piece of foie gras looked like it was placed on a super soft piece of bread that was very sweet and would have been great on its own. \n\nWe then shared the Spring Lamb Duo which was quite a large plate of tasty lamb parts. The loin was my favorite part of this dish as it was perfectly cooked and went perfectly with the sauce that was on the plate.\n\nThe only thing I was unhappy with during dinner was that we didn't have any room for dessert! \n\nOur waitress Emily was amazing!! Thank you so much!! Everyone at The Barrymore was very helpful and friendly.\n\nWe can't wait to go back!"

Then we walked into the Barymore and it was even better, Decore is old Vegas 70's style but modern. Hostess to greet you as soon as you walk in, nice bar, stellar drinks, i loved the Barrymore made with Gentlemen Jack!! They have a cool little patio with a fire pit and the main dining room with the big booths was really retro and romantic. We started off with the foi gras and the steak tar tar, loved the first the second could have been a little more seasoned with a little kick. For entree my wife had the lobster, nice plating and agaist my wifes wishes  i could not pass up the steak house burger, it was huge and delish!! Apple tart for desert, very good. Service was good, nice pace on bringing out courses until we were finishing up entrees. Waited a bit for the clearing of plates and ordering dessert and actually getting the dessert and check. Over all we will def be back, hidden new gem, this is wherte i am sending people i know and people i meet when i am at work!!"

Sitting inside the Royal Resort on Convention Center Dr, is this hidden gem. \n\nWe were seated inside the dining room and I immediately loved the place. The Retro Old School Vegas vibe really intrigued me. Surrounded by mirrored walls and movie film reels on the ceiling, dark curtains and plush booths, we both really liked the vibe. \n\nOur server, Kendra, was eager to offer her suggestion on cocktails, after what we told her what we liked, she had suggested a jalepeno infused watermelon martini for myself and a sazerac for my friend. Both drinks were delicious.\n\nBread basket came out and I immediately spotted the pretzel roll. I love a good bread basket and this one did not disappoint. \n\nWe started out with 1/2 dozen of Kumiai Oysters that were the special that day, I'm mad I've never had this oyster before! They were really good. \n\nSpecial of the day was John Dory fish, again I had never even of this fish, so I decided to try it. My friend ordered Bone In Ribeye. My fish was very mild, it was cooked perfectly. My friends Ribeye was the table favorite. We learned the grill master has been at it for 20 years, and it shows. Steak was tender and juicy. \n\nWe shared the famous Lobster Mac & Cheese, it's as good as it sounds. \n\nUnfortunately we were too full to try dessert. Next time.\n\nThey have a courtyard with a fire pit, it's the perfect time of year for outdoor dining. I really enjoyed this place, I can't say enough about the service as well, Kendra was great. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items."

My party came in at 8pm Monday night and the restaurant was completely dead. There was a table of 2 already enjoying their dinner and it seems our party of 10 was the last of the night. The main room is absolutely gorgeous, however it is also rather small (ergo I can see how it can be hard to get a reservation).\n\nDon't come here expecting revolutionary gastronomic new fancy dishes, instead expect classic French.\n\nSadly the food overall is just OK. Nothing great. The yelp offer for a free glass per person ended up capping out at 8. They ended up charging us for 2 glasses at the end of the night because of it and said nothing could be done since the register wouldn't let them take it off. It was extremely shady. Taking off a star just for that."

They have a lounge in the front with a full bar so that should come in handy when you're waiting to be seated or want a nice drink. I love the look and vibe of the Barrymore. I love that it feels like an amazing hidden gem. \n\nOur server was Emily and she was so pleasant to have :) she even made a few recommendations on the menu which I always like. Their bread basket was scrumptious with some very interesting breads! Also, we were given vegetables with truffle sauce (complements of the chef). \n\nThe food:\n\n* Lobster Mac & Cheese Appetizer!!!\nTHE HYPE OVER THIS IS REAL! It was absolutely delicious and easily shareable between two people! I wanted more (if only I had room)! I only wished that it had more lobster. \n\n* Foie Gras \nMy friend ordered this because he's from California and it is banned over in his state so he was very excited to try it! He said it was delicious, and I had a bite of it. Fatty duck liver :p lol! Extremely interesting texture. \n\n* New York Strip (14 oz)\nThis was definitely one of the juiciest steaks that I have had the pleasure of eating. It was cooked a little above medium rare, but as long as it's not medium then I'm happy. I paired it was bernaise sauce and my taste buds danced. \n\n* Bone-In Rib Eye\nHis steak was absolutely juicy as well and I am surprised he finished it because it was a great portion! \n\n* Saut\u00e9ed Spinach Side\nI would skip it because it wasn't anything special. \n\n* Sweet Onion with Jalape\u00f1o Peppers\nThis sucker was absolute huge! I have never seen a bigger onion in my life. My friend liked his side but the onion conquered. It was just too big for him lol. \n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert, but were given two complementary mini macarons. \n\nOverall, I would love to come back again!"

Our server, Israel was attentive, funny, and very knowledgeable. The hotel was kitchy and cute.

Ask for Luis who was well versed with the menu, gave ample time between seating, ordering and serving. \n\nFood: Generous amounts that can be shared. Well rounded menu. Bread basket was awesome! Pretzel rolls were a hit and I was addicted to the Parmesan flat bread. \n\nDessert: Interesting. Apple Cheesecake was a hit at our table but  I was intrigued by the dark chocolate tart with orange zest ice cream. I couldn't put my finger on it as to what was that powdery taste in the ice cream. Turns out it was splenda...wouldn't guess that but it made it interesting. Didn't get to try the 3rd as I was concentrating on the ice cream but it must have been good since it was all gone. \n\nAmbiance: I'm a sucker for 1950s Hollywood Glam. Booth style seating with a few tables in the middle area. Beautiful wine display.\n\nCons: I missed my chance for some fois gras! Sold out for the night! Thanks for the offer next time we are out in Vegas. \n\nOverall: A small quaint restaurant that was an excellent choice for our group of 7. You know it's a good meal when everyone leaves happy and full...and we only had maybe 1 to 2 drinks. Service was beyond awesome and made our night by serving us 3 desserts for our table to share. The best was when our waiter packed up my friend's meal and since she mentioned how much she liked the pretzel bread, he packed her up 6 more! The Barrymore is definitely old Vegas charm with some damn good food."

I called The Barrymore and the receptionist said there was a slight wait, but took my reservation and applied my drive time to my reservation. I was already sold. By the time I showed up, my girlfriend and I were immediately seated at a cute little table for two with a view of the fire-pit and patio outside. As soon as our glasses of wine were brought out, the GM approached our table and whisked us away to the back room and asked if we would be more comfortable enjoying our meal there. It was like our already 5-star experience got upgraded to a 6-star experience. The decor is old-Hollywood glam (me and my red lipstick fit right in), the lobster mac was out-of-this-world, and the chef CUT OUR STEAK UP FOR US! I've represented several high-end restaurants in Houston, and I've never experienced that type of service. AMAZING. We felt like princesses, and in fact, our waiter told us we should be treated like princesses when my friend attempted to place her own napkin in her lap, and he insisted that's why he was there --as he placed her napkin in her lap--- to wait on us hand and foot. The whole experience was straight out of a movie! \nWe had such a great dining experience, we decided to extend our stay for a cocktail at the bar. The bartenders were so friendly and even explained the history of the Barrymores' glass sign by the bar (I'll let you ask...such a cool little story).\nI've lived here for a year now, and this is officially my go-to resto to bring any family members, clients and friends who are in town!"

The dish also came with a cute basket of very crisp and perfectly seasoned fries. Along with the burger, we shared some calamari that came with romesco sauce.

            "review": "HUGE fan. Just loved this place and yes...we found it on Yelp. (course!) Yelp drives our dining world. :)\n\nHuge diamond in the ruff of Vegas. Nestled in a small hotel off the strip on Convention Center drive, Yelp said it was open at 11 so we rolled in for lunch only to be told they are open dinner hours only starting at 5/530 - can't remember. So heads up, it's a dinner establishment. \n\nIt's decoreated in old-style Vegas. The celing has what looks like old movie film reels all over it. The bar is outstanding with wine bottles everywhere.  The FOOD rocks your world. \n\nStarted with white wine and The Barrymore Cocktail. Just drink it. :) \n\nLobster Macaroni and Cheese and a Pesto covered Artichoke dish. Had a salad much like a caprese salad but BETTER. Scallops wrapped in bacon. Didn't finish but 1 out of 3 as I was STUFFED with our appetizers and salads....we passed on dessert. I know. Hard to believe. \n\nOur staff was FABULOUS. The ambiance is exceptional. It's the best kept secret in Vegas. By pass the chain places you can get at home. By pass where \"everyone seems to go\" and take some time to go to the Barrymore. You will NOT be sorry! :) \nWe'd go again in an instant."

            "review": "We went to the Barrymore for an intimate family dinner. The decor of the restaurant was cozy, yet luxurious. But on to the good stuff: The food. Which was delicious, but frankly, having read the reviews and for the price (which isn't unreasonable, but certainly not inexpensive) I expected nothing less. \n\nFor appetizers we had the lobster Mac and cheese and the diver scallops. The mac and cheese was very creamy, but slightly slacking in seasoning and lobster in my opinion. The scallop entree however, was delicious, and of that, we finished every last bite. For entrees, we had the bone-in rib eye, with lobster, and the Chilean sea bass on risotto. We also ordered a side of the twice-baked potato. ALL THE ENTREES (and side) WERE COOKED AND SEASONED TO PERFECTION. That being said, the lobster was hands-down our favorite part of the entire meal. OMG so buttery I could die LOL\n\nWhat really blew me away at the Barrymore however, was the service. For starters, we originally made our late dinner reservations for 9:30, however as our show was running late, we wouldn't be able to make that time. I called to request if we could push our reservations back to 9:45/10 and the hostess was more than happy to accommodate. Moreover, throughout our meal, our servers were also extremely attentive and kind without being overbearing. They truly made it a point to make us feel special and to make sure we were enjoying our meal and ourselves, which made our experience just that much more enjoyable. And to add to the already wonderful meal, they brought us a complimentary piece of chocolate cake, which was a dessert/chocolate lovers dream! (Get it and you won't regret it )\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a place to have a delicious and classy dinner, I highly recommend the Barrymore. We will definitely be paying them another visit some time soon"

The somm was particularly nice to talk to about wine, as he was informative while still maintaining cheerful banter.  The food was what I expected for the price point, however it all felt as if it had more promise than realization.  The dishes almost felt as if they were held back in terms of etching out the flavors they wanted to achieve.  More broad strokes than defining signatures, but enjoyable none the less.

So we sat at the bar. Very nice bar. We sat and had drinks made by Kendra and her tattooed buddy Cody. Very cool. Great glass of Pinot Grigio.  Tried a few of their bloody marys. We were so early that we had an appetizer at the bar. We ordered the octopus and it was phenomenal. We also ate an entire bread basket and the warm salted butter it came with was delicious. At 7:30 we moved to our table. Unfortunately, that's when things kinda went down hill. First it was freezing but immediately the hostess said something to the manager and he turned down the air con AND he checked back with us to make sure the temp was good. We then ordered the soup of the day - Barrymore's special matzah ball soup and my husband and I ordered a rare filet mignon and their lobster Mac & cheese as a side. Our service changed dramatically after we moved from the bar. We went from cool attentive Kendra and her laid back pal Cody to totally cheesy yet non attentive main waiter Louis. Louis was the kind of waiter who was like \"yes, yes anything you want\" but you ended up sitting there waiting for a piece of bread and a glass of water. Our filet came and it was completely overcooked.   We had asked for it rare and the steak we got was at best, medium ... at best. And you know that if you like your steak rare getting served a Medium steak filet is an abomination.   And the lobster Mac and cheese was bland and flavorless. \nS**t happens in the restaurant business. Sometimes food doesn't come out the way you want it to. It's what the management does and how they handle things that matters. I can tell you that despite all the things that weren't perfect with our meal it was the way Chad, the manager on duty handled everything that really made Barrymore's worth going back to. Less than 4 min after our steak went back Chad was at our table. I explained to him how great everything was when we were served from the bar area and how things sadly just went downhill when we went to the main dining room. He cared!  He immediately asked what he could get us while we waited for our new steak. We swapped out the lobster Mac n cheese for corn and lobster and that was delicious. He came over and poured me another glass of wine without me asking. Then he suggested that after dinner we have dessert back up at the bar with Kendra. Chad just made you feel like he cared!  He really wanted you to enjoy your meal and experience at Barrymore's. This is THE GUY you want as your GM if you own a restaurant. He turned our experience around 180. We ended up having coffee and dessert up at the bar (totally comp'd) and spent time talking to Kendra and Chad. So ultimately, you should go The Barrymore. When you do, say hi to Kendra and Chad and have a good evening. We did."

Very attentive staff, my water glass was always full, and the food came quickly.\nFor the main course I ordered the salmon and my fiance ordered a steak topped with foie gras (he said it was the best steak he ever had, even compared to Del Friscos and other steak houses).

            "review": "My girlfriend chose the Barrymore for her birthday celebration given the great reviews and promise of a fine dining experience. Once arriving in Vegas, we got ready and excitedly headed to the Barrymore for dinner.\n\nDaniel introduced himself as our server. One of the 13 guests handed him a bottle of wine that he had purchased in celebration of our friend's birthday. Daniel offered to waive the $35 corkage fee with the purchase of a bottle of champagne. We chose a Rose, toasted the birthday girl, and began to order.\n\nLet me start by saying that my favorite food is steak and baked potato. Daniel had told us they were a steakhouse known for their delicious steaks and seafood. The menu to my last supper would definitely include a rib-eye steak cooked medium rare and a baked potato with all the toppings! Of course when it came time for me to order, this is exactly what I wanted. My friend and I were sharing and she ordered the seafood special which included sea bass and lobster tail. We added a side of Brussels sprouts to keep it healthy.\n\nWhen the food came out, my mouth was watering. I cut into the steak and it was seemingly cooked just as I had asked. I was met with disappointment when I tasted it and it seemed like a steak I could get from the Outback but double the price. It was simply seasoned as I like it, but it wasn't juicy and flavorful as I had imagined. The seabass was delicious as well as the risotto with green sauce. Simple, cooked well, and tasty. The lobster tail was terrible. It was rubbery and wasn't cooked well. The baked potato was just as disappointing. When I imagine baked potato at a restaurant like this, I get excited at the thought of a loaded fluffy potato with all the toppings! They must have threw \"fine dining\" out of the window because it was presented simply as a potato cut in half from the grocery store. No embellishments, no plating. Just the potato all by it's lonesome. It's friends sour cream, chives, butter and bacon came on the side on a separate plate. It just wasn't appetizing. The Brussels sprouts were oily and overpowered by everything else it was cooked in. All in all, the food was mediocre at best. This means a lot coming from someone who is always on a diet and is looking for a place to splurge and indulge in. I was disappointed.\n\nEverything came out so slowly that we started to get impatient. Daniel brings us the bill instead of offering us dessert. When we asked for the dessert menu (birthday girl gets a free dessert!) Daniel said he didn't offer us dessert since we were in a rush. Really? So we don't even sing happy birthday to the birthday girl?\n\nOnce the bill finally comes out, we notice the $35 corkage fee on the bill. We inquire since Daniel told us the champagne would waive the fee. He then gets defensive and replies, \"I said if you got a FEW bottles of champagne I would waive the fee. Not just one bottle.\" We tell him we are upset since he told us otherwise and we ask for the manager.\n\nThe manager, Paul, tells us it was impossible for Daniel to have said that since he does not have the power to waive the corkage fee because that's just the way they do things. I have a few problems with this. One, why the heck would Daniel even make such an offer when he doesn't have the power to do so. Two, why wouldn't an exception be made since this is what we were promised? Three, it's not like we were given a free bottle of wine. It was the service of pouring the wine that consisted of the fee. It literally was of no cost to the restaurant! \n\nWe then decide that we would take the fee out of Daniel's tip since he clearly didn't deserve one after lying to us and refusing to take responsibility for his words. Paul with his poor management skills and inability to make thirteen customers happy also didn't help. We didn't want to leave a tip at all. Paul then threw in his two cents and states that the gratuity is listed on the menu and that we were required to pay for it since our party was greater than six. Therefore, after the terrible service, an unhappy birthday girl and 12 other angry customers, we are forced to pay tip on a $1400 bill. Seriously, $35 is nothing, especially split by 13 people, but not when we were lied to and tricked into buying a bottle of champagne. Then Paul steps in and says he will try to make us happy. Yet, the $35 corkage fee is still sneakily placed on the bill. Still refusing to tip an exhausting and terrible restaurant experience, we calculate the bill without the tip and ask the waiter to charge our cards accordingly. He then pulls a card at random and tells the owner of the card he will have to charge hundreds extra to make up for the rest of the group. Daniel wanted his tip and took it however he could!\n\nI am appalled by the service at this restaurant. Thanks for nothing, except ruining our first night in Vegas and the birthday girl's dinner over a $35 corkage fee at a \"classy\" restaurant."

Be patient and wait for the bread (with bacon) they make it to order! The lobster Mac and cheese is to die for. Veg heads, try the curry! Very delicious. The Chunnel as a cocktail is fab, as well as the Moscow mule, I have never had such a cold cup! Overall, a definite must try in Vegas. A true gem of a place."

The ambviance is just delightful and quirky with an old vegas meets old hollywood vibe with the velvet semi-circle booths and inkplot portraits.... It's comfortable and classy at the same time.  The waitstaff has you in the palm of their hand from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave - describing dishes, providing extensive knowledge about the food and its preparation, liberally giving you their recommendations if you are waffling (which I do), getting you set up with the correct before-dinner drinks, etc.  They are incredibly friendly and not stuffy at all and you really feel like you are just getting the most amazing service from someone who is thrilled to be there and there with you.  The sommalier (who I believe is also the manager?  I could be wrong?) is THE BEST!  We told him what we wanted in a wine and what our tastes were leaning towards as of late as well as our price-point, and he outlined several choices, describing each wine in sommalier terms that were technical as well as knowledgeable...  From that, he gave us his final recommendation, which we went with, and of course it was PERFECT...The thing about The Barrymore is that the food backs it all up!  Great service and just amazing food.  We had the lobster macaroni and cheese for an appetizer (sweet lord good) and swooned over the bread selection, especially the one with the bacon and fruit (cranberries? maybe cherries?) baked in....  We then went onto   My husband had the ribeye and I had the quail and we shared a side of the risotto special that day on the waiter's recommendation, and he was dead on.  It was all just out of this world.  Two regrets - we ate at Sage in the Aria the next night and it was a big fat expensive disappointment after The Barrymore... also we were too full to try desert....  something I will regret for  a long time:)"

It's located just off the strip near The Encore.\n\nIt's located inside a small hotel and with a not so appealing outside. Do not let this stop you from checking this place out. Trust me!\n\nWhen I walked in The Barrymore I was stoked--\"I found a gem and I know I won't be let down!\" Immediately to my right was an old school Vegas lounge singer and his piano man. I kid you not, the singer said, \"I'm here every night except next Friday. I'm taking my girlfriend out.\" It was such a cliche lounge singer statement, but it worked!\n\nWe were seated in their very cozy, intimate main dining room. Our waiter promptly greeted us. The Barrymore has a very impressive wine list. I opted for a glass of \"The Whispering Angel\" rose and found to be light and satisfying. \n\nWe were served with a basket of freshly baked breads and warm salted butter. The breads were so delicious the basket was empty before we knew it. With great will power we declined a second basket. We choose all items suggested by our waiter. We had scallops for our appetizer....halla! The scallop appetizer was something to write home about! yum! yum! Our main entrees: bone in filet and chilean sea bass. Both items were good, but I must say they were a bit on the over cooked side--not too much, but just enough to notice. \n\nFor desert we got the apple cheesecake tart thingy. Perfect size! We were super stuffed, but wanted to experience all courses offered. Another great suggestion from our waiter. \n\nI can't say enough good things about the staff. They made us feel welcomed and they cared about our experience. It wasn't just our waiter checking on us, even other waiters asked us with enthusiasm if we enjoying our dinning experience. \n\nI can't wait to go back. The Barrymore is a really cool place."

We asked them to give us a call if they got a cancellation and they called with a 730 available time.  They were very pleasant.\n\nWe arrived and and had a drink at the bar were seated fairly promptly.  Restaurant had nice atmosphere.  \n\nWe began with the lobster deviled eggs.  They were definately fresh good for deviled eggs but if lobster wasn't in the name I would not have guessed there was lobster in the dish.  \n\nI had the chopped salad and my husband had the dinner salad with balsalmic dressing.  Both were fresh, mine had good flavors.\n\nFor our main course I had the lobster mac and cheese (the appetizer left me wanting more lobster) and my husband had the the Hangar Steak.  Mine wasn't at all special not even great for mac and cheese and again minimal lobster and no significant lobster flavor.  My husband really didn't like his steak and although small didn't finish the dish.  Really said the flavor was off.  \n\nThe waiter recognized my husband didn't enjoy the flavor and was very apologetic.  Although my husband would not have sent it back no one really came by to check if everything was ok until it would have been too late anyway.  \n\nThe waiter did comp the dessert because of my husbands dislike of his dish and was very eagar to make it right.  My husband ordered the molten lava cake and this was really dry without any real \"molten\" center.\n\nI don't like to write bad review but this restaurant is way over rated in my opinion.  The staff was very pleasant but they could not make up for the poor flavors in the food.  \n\nWe will not return."

His selection of Pinot Noir was right on the mark!  We ordered the Sicilian octopus appetizer which my daughter and I shared (the BF opted to pass.)  The bread basket was awesome. Fresh baguettes, parmesan cheese crisps and a hearty bread that was sweet (dried fruit) and savory (our favorite.)  The octopus was a little on the chewy side, but was still delicious topped with the onion relish.  My daughter had squash curry.  True to Gabriel's word, the curry was light and delicious.  I will be on the search for vadouvan spice in Vegas soon.   The BF had the NY Strip.  While no sauce was needed, the B\u00e9arnaise was the hands down winner.  I had the Alaskan halibut.  The fish was moist and very flavorful.  As a rule, I do not like okra (too slimy), but give me those crispy fried critters any day.   Just wish there were a few more.    We were all much too full for dessert, so we decided just to \"look\" at the dessert menu.  Gabriel said that his favorite dessert was the Raspberry Frangipane tart, which we shared (fought over).  The tartness of the sherbet and the sweetness of the almond raspberry tart were perfect.  We kept hitting spoons!  It was a great night, made special by the great company and interaction with Gabriel.  Did I say that I love Gabriel?"

The staff is warm, well-informed on their offerings, and willing to extend their expertise and hospitality.

Drop in on Jesus at the marble-top bar and order yourself up a \"Barrymore,\" or one of the other specialty drinks.

Though, not sure why it says dressy, it's definitely a more business casual/trendy vibe. \n\nWHAT a find! Definitely off the beaten path, but a cheap cab ride (from city center) to a pretty great meal, vintage decor and a terrific bunch of people. A touch of class and personality in Vegas. \n\nDon't be surprised if people can't find it and make jokes about Drew Barrymore when you ask where it is. As soon as you turn right onto Convention Center Drive, it'll be on your right hand side almost immediately. \n\nFor lunch, we started with the lobster mac and cheese. Now, I'm lactose intolerant -- but I will have you know, if I didn't have anywhere else to go that day, I would've eaten it all! YUM.  I opted for the lobster roll and my friend chose the burger. Both were the perfect serving size and tasty. We also enjoyed the signature Barrymore drink which was concocted from Gentleman Jack (which I usually dislike) orange marmalade believe it or not and some other ingredients. Don't judge! It was lunch in Vegas -- cocktails are acceptable this early ;)\n\nAfter speaking with the manager, it turns out they do dinner up pretty big as well. Jerome (I think) runs a tight ship and really pays attention to cleanliness.  \n  \nWhile sitting at the bar after lunch to finish my cocktail, I met Monica who was really chill, friendly and helpful. Behind the bar is a custom made TV within a vintage looking gold frame. When the tv isn't on -- it's a mirror.  There's a couple of these inside. I totally want one for inside the house. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink next (since now we were in full swing of conversation and my previous glass was empty) when I asked if she had a few particular items to make my self-created cocktail, the Hendy.  She executed perfectly and the manager agreed it was the epitome of the perfect summer drink.  I truly hope to see it on the menu then  :)\n\nWe also met Billy, the owner, who also owns Holsteins in the Cosmo.  (where we ended up for lunch the following day). Turns out the bottomless bloody Mary I was eying, the Hillbilly, which uses beef brisket infused vodka, is named after him. Can't say I tried it -- but had I been there for brunch, I certainly would. \n\nOverall -- this new spot is definitely one I'll continue to visit when I'm in Vegas."

We were very excited about this party. All of the guests were out of town, and we came to Las Vegas especially for this celebration. My cousin's wife made a reservation in advanced, and she was told that she can bring her own drinks and pay a corky change of $30. When we arrived to the party were told by the manager that they don't have a hard liquor license, but if we paid him $100 under the table he will allow opening our own bottle. In his own words \"When money talk law does not matter\". By the way they serve cocktails with martini. We asked him how it possible if they don't have a license $100 makes it an \"OK\".  Manager told us \"the F*** out from his restaurant\". We saw him drink vodka directly from the bottle while he was on a duty.\n I believe to all the reviews that say that food is an exceptional in this restaurant, but we did not have a chance to try it. The restaurant's manager ruined my cousin's birthday, and I cannot even express our disappointment and don't understand how any respectable establishment can tolerate member of staff with this kind of manners."

We took a group there a couple days ago and I have to tell you I won't be back.\n\nThere was hardly anyone in the restaurant so you would think we'd get good service.  We didn't.  I had a filet as I had before and while it was cooked correctly, the cut was not tender.  I had to work my way through it.  Others in my party who had steak had similar complaints.\n\nWe brought wine as we always do and offered tastes to our waiter, who accepted.  Normally that results in a break on the corkage fee.  Not here apparently.  We were charged the full $35 per bottle.  The next night we visited our favorite waiter at our favorite steakhouse in Vegas and brought 4 bottles.  Our waiter only charged us one corkage and comped us 3 desserts.  That's the way you get a bigger tip and generate loyalty.  Something The Barrymore needs to learn.\n\nWe had a party of 10 so I expected an automatic service charge but there wasn't one on the bill so we only added 15% because of the service.  Low and behold when the credit card receipt came back there was an 18% service charge written in by hand.  The folks at the table who paid cash made out because I had to make up the difference.\n\nAgain, no way to get me back.  It's took bad.  I thought we had found a regular stop but we won't be back."

The service was helpful, and the wine list couldn't have been better.  The Napa Cabernet by the glass is AMAZING! I will have to call and get the name for my own satisfaction but so smooth, the perfect wine.  We ordered some lobster Mac for the appetizer and it's safe to say it was a big hit at our table, the plate was basically spotless.  I don't usually comment on the complimentary breads but oh my, that had to be the best pretzel bread I've ever had! I ordered the free range chicken for my entree.  The food took about 40 min after ordering to be brought out to the table, I thought that was a bit long but the atmosphere was comforting enough to let it slide.  When my chicken came and I cut into the juicy breast, my taste buds went crazy! It was so delicious, my mouth is watering just reciting the memory! My husband got the New York steak, of course I had to try a piece and man was it charred to perfection and so tasty! The Brussels sprouts with bacon we're great along with the asparagus, and the corn.  The mashed potatoes seemed a bit plain to me, but other than that the experience couldn't have been better! To finish off dinner we all split a lemon cheesecake that made your taste buds disregard the full stomach and dig in for more. I loved the experience, the boutique, elegant, Gatsby feel.  We'll be referring many friends and family!"

Out of a whole vacation of awesome food, the grilled octopus we had here might have been the best thing I ate the whole trip. The lobster Mac and Cheese was great too as were the cocktails and wine selection. \n\nWe were extremely well taken care of by our server. He brought out champagne and desert when he found out it was my birthday and was very friendly and attentive without hovering. He said the chef refused to tell anyone how they got the octopus so tender, though, so don't bother asking. This is a perfect restaurant for a romantic dinner. \n\nThe only weird thing is the 2 star hotel it's in. It's the kind of place that people would stay at on road trips before smartphones and the only way you'd know of a hotel is if you could see it from the freeway. When we were pulling up, I was thinking \"where the hell are you taking me?\"  There were more NASCAR jackets in the hotel lobby  than full sets of teeth, but once you get into the restaurant, its hard not to get pulled into its Old Hollywood style vibe. It's just cool. That's the perfect word for it. \n\nLike I said, the food was great and the service was awesome.

We shared an appetizer of fried artichoke which was stellar.  We each has salads (chopped and a bibb lettuce and hearts of palm) and both were very fresh and dressed well.  The salads are quite large and in hindsight we probably should have split one.\n\nFor entrees we had the scallops and the sea bass.  Both were quite good - we thought the scallop dish was the better of the 2.  The sea bass was quite a lot of food and very hearty.\n\nThe service from hostess to server to management was really quite good.  I really had a sense that they all really care about this restaurant and will do their best to make their diners happy.\n\nAll in all really good food in a decent atmosphere (assuming that the dining room is more full).  I'd probaby give 3.5 stars but since that is not allowed I give 4 based on the low prices (probably the least expensive meal we had in Vegas) and the really good service."

The hotel lobby was pretty nicely decorated and furnished with a pool table, foozball, and there was even a pianist playing on the piano! Swanky!\n\nI seriously love the decor of the main dining area with the old school movie reels on the ceiling.\n\nOur waiter was super sweet and very helpful with menu selections. \n\nI had the signature Barrymore cocktail which was heavy on the whiskey with a slight hint of orange. It probably would have been more delicious if I hadn't been sucking down on a football full of daiquiri all day... sigh. \n\nThe table shared the calamari and lobster mac n cheese. The calamari were lightly breaded and super tender - loved the romesco sauce with it!  The lobster mac n cheese was rich and decadent, definitely cannot eat too much of it in one sitting. For entrees I had the pan fried sea bass with a bean ragout and crispy baby brussel sprouts. Everything was super flavorful and I must admit my favorite thing on the dish were those crispy little brussel sprout bites!\n\nAt the end of the day I'm only giving The Barrymore four stars because although the food was delicious and flavorful, it wasn't mind blowing or extraordinary. Solid though."

I also had sides of cream corn and Brussels sprouts.  I thought they were a bit too rich and salty for me but not horrible or anything.  What was horrible was the SERVICE from the waiter Daniel and the manager Paul.\n\nI was there for a birthday party with a group of 13.  Before dinner, we were told by Daniel that if we purchased a bottle of Ros\u00e9, we would get free corkage for a bottle of wine that we brought.  We didn't even want an $85 bottle  Ros\u00e9 but figured \"why not?\"  When the $1400 bill finally came, the corkage fee appeared on the bill and we questioned the waiter about it.  He proceeded to argue with us that if we had purchased a couple more bottles of Ros\u00e9 then he would've waived the fee.  Becoming more and more annoyed, we asked to speak to the manager Paul.  We explained to Paul the misunderstanding in hopes that he could settle the small $35 error.  I was disappointed  to find out that he was unwilling to waive the minuscule $35 corkage fee from our pretty substantial bill of $1400.  Yes, I know it seems petty to argue over $35 (a few dollars a person) but isn't it more petty for the manager of this so called \"high end $$$$ restaurant\" to argue back?  I would completely understand if we were trying to ask him to knock off all of our alcohol fees but come on, $35 for corkage??!!!  He defiantly told us that the waiter Daniel had no authority to tell us that if we bought the bottle of Ros\u00e9, we could get the corkage waived.  Well then shouldn't that mistake fall on Daniel and not us???  Nope, Paul said he could do absolutely nothing.  This of course infuriated everyone.  We were NOT happy. \n\nWe then requested them to remove the 20% automatic gratuity, for obvious reasons.  Paul said we couldn't do that since its an \"enforced\" gratuity.  Why should we pay 20% gratuity when the waiter lied to us and when the manager was incompetent??  It would be so easy for Paul to say \"sorry for the misunderstanding, I'll waive this $35 fee from your bill .\"  Instead, he chose to go the idiotic route and argue with us about how the waiter was wrong but we had to pay for his mistake.  Unbelievable service...in the worst way possible.  In the end we were still charged the $35 corkage and 20% gratuity!!!  I have never had a restaurant experience like this in my whole life.   Everyone was upset and complaining about the whole fiasco for the rest of the night.  Not what I expected from \"fine dining\" in Vegas."

I was real curious of their lobster roll but unfortunately it got taken off the menu a few weeks prior. We also wanted to know, is this the best burger in Vegas? \n\nGrilled fish tacos - these were pretty decent. The fish were fresh and came 2 to a order. I like the grilled pepper and onion on the side - just like San Diego tacos. It came with their fries which were wonderfully sprinkled with fried herbs that added something special to their very crisp thin fry. \n\nSteakhouse burger- we asked for medium rare and it came out well done, no pink at all. We haven't eaten a red meat in 5 months so it made me sad that rare meat meal was not. It was juicy enough for a well done burger so I can still tell it was quality meat. The bun was nice and the sweet carmelized onion-y BBQ sauce was fantastic. I dipped the fries in only that So far, to answer my own question - Bradley Ogden still wins. \n\nThe manager here was really great about it though and was apologetic and asked if he can get us a dessert. We got a coconut panna cotta w/ mango and a pink pepper merengue crisp. Desserts here are a strong point as all the desserts we've had here impressed the BF who normally doesn't give a crap about after dinner desserts.\n\nService was alright during the meal. It trailed off in the end when we were given our check but was held hostage by our server. Nothing gets me more antsy than that. I can wait for good food. I can excuse a bit if it is really busy. When you know a person it trying to leave I would get back to them in 1-2 mins of dropping it off instead of going off. Not also the time you want to make a guest anxious as it is the closest time to tip time. \n\nBetween the burger and the hostage situation, I think dropping a star is fair. I would go during dinner though. From my last reviews, there's this bartender with glasses and this one male server who is a absolute veteran that will make it shine. My last service and food experiences at night have been stellar enough that I'll be coming back of course."

Our cab driver had no idea where this place was, let alone the Royal Resort. If you are an urbanite foodie seeking a hole-in-the-wall hidden gem, this is it. Right around the corner from Wynn with an old city steakhouse retro kind of feel to it, The Barrymore does not disappoint. Manager Chad Jahn seated us and started us off with our request of what we now call the Barrymore Berrylicious. Fabulous cocktail! Our servers were friendly and down-to-earth. We were personally greeted at our table during dinner by Chef Francisco Campa. The food was UNBELIEVABLE! Presentation, flavor combinations, freshness and attention to detail. Highly recommended: Watermelon Carpaccio (w/cucumber, mint, feta/olive oil), Roasted Artichoke (ask how they make this..very unique!), Lobster Mac n' Cheese (I almost cried to see this finally done right!), Short Rib (melts in your mouth, served on carrot mousseline) and the Opakapaka Snapper with a curry mango sauce. Prices are low for the area and food quality: 13 for cockails, 11 for apps, 22-27 for entrees we had. You won't get the flashy, high-heeled hostess/servers here or modern music if that's your thing, but you will get genuinely great food and service in a local type of atmosphere. Great (small) outside patio and bar area too. I believe the restaurant has some affiliation to Drew Barrymore's family but we didn't get the whole story on that. Best part was, for all the times I entered Aria doors to get to a club or restaurant, or return from shopping with hands full, not once did a well-suited Bellman open a door, and I'm no tacky tourist. I was greeted at the Royal with an open door right after I got out of the cab. Now that's service! 5 Stars for this boutique restaurant. Don't let the old hotel fool you.  We'll be back!"

I had the Sea Bass and Lobster Tail and both were blah. The Lobster Tail was not tender, juicy or cooked well. The Brussel Sprouts were a little too salty for my taste! For 13 people, it is a lot of people to handle and a lot of food to cook but the service was very slow. So slow I ate so much bread to hold myself over.

Instead of speeding it up Daniel decides to cut out giving us the cake and offer the dessert menu... which is the whole purpose why we were dining there! Instead he just brings us the check... Speeding up does not mean the end! When we asked about dessert and cake, Daniel said he didn't go through the dessert because we were in a rush. I guess when you say \"We're in a hurry, it means just cut to the chase...! Not sure why it translated that way!\n\nHere comes more problems!

What happened to apologizing and customer service? Regardless, for 13 people to pay the $35 is NO BIG deal but it comes down to the principal. Don't say it and when addressed argue with the customers with no apology! On top of that what is $35 to the restaurant on a group of 13's bill?\n\nHere's more...\nWhen he knew we wouldn't tip as much as they felt right they decided to add extra ($$$) to make up for the lack of tip on a random credit card of their choice!

The \"old Hollywood\" theme was trendy, yet very inviting and comfortable. Definitely not what I would expect for an \"off-the-strip\" restaurant. \n\nWe arrived about 30 mins before our reservation and were directed to enjoy some cocktails at the bar until our table was ready. We decided to go outside to the patio, which was decorated with plush couches and lined with a fire pit. The host (possibly manger) was very attentive to our needs and we were relaxing with drinks in no time. Within a few minutes we were invited to be seated at our booth. \n\nThey say you can tell a great restaurant from the bread, and the cherry bacon rolls were all the indication we needed. To start, our table of four decided to split the lobster mac & cheese, roasted artichoke and calamari. To our delight, the appetizers were much larger than anticipated. If you pick just one app to start, you have to go for the lobster mac. It was the best part of the meal! The noodles were perfect for holding the creamy marscarpone cheese sauce, which tasted like it had hints of truffle oil mixed in with the lobster chunks. Pure heaven. For an entree I got the sea bass with brussel sprouts, which had a perfect sear. My table also enjoyed the ahi tuna (with delicious polenta) and filet. \n\nWe were completely stuffed after the meal but managed to make room for dessert since it was a double birthday dinner. We ordered the chocolate cake and ricotta cheesecake and the waitress served them with candles. Both were absolutely delicious and delicately portioned to not put us over the edge. \n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant. The service was spot on, prices were reasonable and food was delicious. I can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town!"

When we arrived, it was hidden and attached to an old hotel. It didn't look as inviting as I thought until I walked inside the restaurant. It was a hidden gem! The decor was very hollywood-ish and intimate. The first thing that caught my attention was the lobster mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was not heavy at all. It was the perfect mac n cheese. Their bread basket is also out of the ordinary. Bacon and cherry bread? More please! For our entree, we got chicken risotto and grilled scallop. Everything was delicious.

It's off the strip and in a very random location--in some sort of motel that looks kind of sketchy. Getting out of the car I had my reservations, but when we walked in I relaxed a bit.  Definitely has an old school vibe, and it's true that it reminds you of \"mad men\" times. Unfortunately the food didn't quite live up to the ambiance. I started with grilled octopus, which was a bit slimy and didn't have a ton of flavor. For dinner I had a sea bass which was good, but nothing spectacular. All in all, I'd stay on the strip and go to the higher rated places there; this place just wasn't worth the trek."

Without a doubt, it was the best meal we had in Las Vegas (after dining at numerous high end spots in The Palazzo and the Venician).  Service was attentive and friendly and the food absolutely delicious at 1/3 the cost of the fancier spots on the Strip.  The setting (a bit campy in the Royal Resort) only adds to the allure of the restaurant.  My husband had the burger and I had the short ribs and both were superb."

I had a Caesar salad that was good and a bit different since all the lettuce was thoroughly chopped. For dessert I got the gelato which had a strange flavor to it but it was still pretty yummy. I also stole a few bites of the creme brulee and that was amazing. I'd give them an extra star if the service was more consistent but I can certainly understand why it's so popular (by the time we finished dinner, every table was full). Will be back!!!"

This place reminds me of an extremely nice cigar lounge minus the smoke and odors that has been renovated by a modern designer  =)\n\nThe lounge area is very nice area to start off your adventure with a glass of wine or cocktail. They have very comfy seats away from the bar that can be very cozy for two or opened up for small groups.   They have a great sleection of wines and house specialty drinks. \n\nThe dinning areas are also very nice!  Try to get a booth if you can, it's the best seat in the house. The food is as equally impressive as the decor. They have an award winning chef at the helm and he is excellent!  We choose to eat in the lounge since it was lunch and had a burger with fries.  The burger is grass fed beef cooked to perfection and the fries were more like frites with herbs and salt. It was delish!  We also had a chicken Cesar salad that was also very good. \n\nThis is a great place for either drinks in the lounge or for dinning. They are open for for breakfast, lunch and dinner so give them a try if you're in the area."

When we balked it was only then they changed their story that they did have another table.. Something about saving it for another reservation? Huh...\nBad start.\n\nWe order our drinks. I got the Barrymore \"signature\" cocktail that was all whiskey and not much else, and the waiter had to run to the bar twice to find out what style of beer one of their offerings was for my husband. Obviously had no clue about their beer list. Oh yeah, and my drink was delivered to me by reaching clear across the front of me-- not the end of the world but if you want to fancy yourself as a fine dining establishment you need to nail these little details.\n\nThe manager came around and shook our hands which I thought odd to do before the meal. Seemed like a nice enough guy but I don't want to touch your man hands right before I eat. \n\nWe started with the caesar salad and roasted artichoke which were both ok. We noticed all the tables around us had bread so we asked the passing manager if we could get some he responded, \"sure I'll get you more bread..\" I felt like saying \"not more bread, some bread.\" Sorry to put you out there, buddy!\n\nOur entrees were far from spectacular. My husbands strip steak was way rarer than the medium well he had asked for and bloody as hell, and while I ordered the scallops without the oxtail stew since I don't eat red meat, I was surprised that that left me with three... THREE. Scallops. Thats an average of over $8 apiece for these sad scallops. I guess the waiter thought this was perfectly fine and offered no solution like \"hey I see you're paying 26 bucks for three scallops would you like something else other than the oxtail stew?\" But at this point I didn't feel like putting in an effort, so I let it go. Sides were ala carte-- mashed potatoes were yummy but runny like baby food consistency, and the asparagus was not fresh. \n\nNeedless to say we did not stick around for dessert and will never go back. I rely on yelp reviews everywhere I go and I was shocked that this was so off the mark!"

            "review": "The folks behind lbs, Holstein's and a few other of my top burger spots in town just opened up The Barrymore at the little-known Royal Resort just off the Strip, and I was more than excited to see what else they had in store for me. I've read a few things about the place since it opened, plus the pictures of the interior looked like my kind of spot so I really had some high hopes that I would be walking into my next go-to restaurant. All of these things surely added up to a great burger right? Not so much.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a great interior; contemporary, hip, kind of reminds me of the Vintner Grill but maybe a little fancier. There is a really small bar at the front, and I think two different dining rooms, seating a total of only 50 people I think so reservations are probably recommended. The Royal Resort is pretty cool as well, the lobby could still use a bit of work with their ceiling tiles for example, but I'm sure the average person won't notice this.\n\nThe menu looks great, I would definitely go back to try many of the items that sounded delicious, but as usual I'm there for only one thing. I did manage to sneak in the lobster mac & cheese before the burger came out; it was decent but not amazing for $13. I've also heard from many people that they have a fantastic cocktail menu which I wasn't totally in the mood for on this visit but would definitely be willing to go back for.\n\nThe Steakhouse Burger on the menu is listed as grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee, oven-roasted tomatoes and garlic aioli. That's quite a lot of flavors packed into one assembly, and I was almost nervous as to whether all of those would be able to stand out or if some would overpower the others. The burger came out with a very strange looking bun, and pinned with a wooden steak with the lbs logo on it which I thought was odd, but made me even more excited because I haven't had a bad burger there yet. Maybe it's because we weren't actually at lbs but this wasn't up to par. The meat had good flavor, was definitely cooked medium-rare as ordered, but the toppings and bun added up to something just short of working for me. As predicted, I think the toppings all kind of got lost together, although if you isolated and pulled out individual bites of each they were quite good. The bacon marmalade was probably my favorite, and the bun really detracted from everything for me. The bun to meat ratio was ok, but the bun itself was very dry and just really odd. Overall it was ok, but not at all what I was hoping for.\n\nThe fries were good; they had a bit of seasoning and good flavor, and luckily were included with the price of the burger otherwise I'd say the $6 for a side order of them is a bit much. My friend ordered asparagus instead of the fries and we were sadly charged an additional $7. I understand that some menu changes come with an additional fee, but I wasn't too crazy about that line item on our bill even given the 'fanciness' of the restaurant. If we hadn't done any strange swaps, our meal would have come to $27 for the two burgers which isn't horrible given the location just off the Strip as well as the interior of the restaurant, unfortunately I thought the burger was just ok. My friend liked hers, but I thought it could be better. If you want to spend about the same on a really great burger I'd say go to Holstein's if you're on the strip or lbs if you're out in the suburbs. But if you want to check out a really cool looking restaurant and eat some other great food definitely check this place out."

Don't come here for fish or vegetarian food; don't waste your $$$. We came for steak and foie gras, and seeing sweetbreads on the menu was a big bonus point. There are two dining rooms: you want the nicer, club-like one with semi-circular plush booths along the walls. The other is bland and opens off the bar, making it noisy. The waiter was also better the first night, altho waitstaff outside the SF Bay Area is almost always a level higher in training and professionalism.\n\nWe skipped the specials, which are priced very high, and stayed with basic steak. Good steak doesn't need sauces, either, so we skipped those too. We liked very much:\n\n- Seared Foie Gras with Quince and Almonds. We love foie gras, and La Folie/SF used to make it best. This wasn't up to LF, but it was very good and cooked perfectly. Good size, too. No complaints, outside of the quince being slightly oversweetened.\n\n- Sweetbreads: Served with sweet glazed onion shreds, arugula microgreens, and a lovely breaded and fried potato parsnip croquette. There was no real sauce with the sweetbreads, just a bit of au jus, and it was delightful. A great rebuke to SF Bay Area chefs who think sweetbreads always need battering and deep-frying to be acceptable - NOT!\n\n- Endive and Green Apple Salad. Would have liked a bit more gorgonzola but I loved the refreshing bitterness after the two rich starters. Probably big enough to share; I had this as my entree.\n\n- Crispy Pork Belly: served with a blue cheese mousse and root veggies. Excellent. Wiped the plate clean.\n\n- Creamed Corn w/Lobster; also the Roasted Brussels Sprouts. Both excellent. Nice to see the sprouts cooked first, THEN grilled. That way they don't have to be cooked into charcoal to be edible. \n\n- 8-oz Filet. This was filet of rib-eye the first night but filet mignon the second. The rib-eye is always better, but both were perfectly cooked and delicious. Yes, meat needs to be salted to taste good, something CA cooks seem to have forgotten.\n\n- Bread pudding. The dessert of choice, far better than the others. Very soft, great with coffee.\n\nGood not great:\n- 14-oz NY strip. I am not a NY strip fan, with beef getting so lean these days. Our friends split this, but they agreed the filet was much better and switched on the second night. It is okay, but not as thick as the filet so the pre-salting came off a bit heavy-handed.\n\n- Chocolate Pear Tart and Caramel Apple Cheesecake. Good, but they tasted like commercial desserts, not really special but an okay way to end a meal.\n\nDon't order:\n- Octopus. It was a huge portion; very tender but uninteresting. Octopus really needs the kiss of smoke to add some umami; this came off like imitation Spanish food for wimps. It needed to be bolder and better flavored; the piquillos were fine but there was no pimenton. The gigante beans were undercooked slightly."

The Barrymore is a hidden treasure located in the little boutique-like hotel off of Convention Center Drive (across the street from Ross).  Who knew???\n\nAnyways, I was so excited to try something different...and to suprise my honey for Valentines Day.  We got seated immediately as our reservation was for 6:30 on Friday night.  There was only a couple other tables with people at the time we were seated but come 7pm the place was full.  We ordered our drinks Chardonney and the Barrymore (signature drink) which both were great!  A little pricey but good.  My glass of wine was $13.  A selection of breads came out...warm and delish.  The Italian bread crusted with salt was my favorite.\n\nFor appetizer we had the shrimp cocktail (on steriods).  They were gigantic!  We both ordered the filets and OMG Im so glad we did.  It was melt in your mouth goodness.  The sides we picked (which are ordered separately) were mashed potatoes (the creamiest I think I have ever had) and the brocollini which was a nice addition too.\n\nAnd did I mention the decor and the ambiance???  This was a Del Friscos meets old Vegas feel.  A little on the dark side which the waiter had a flashlight to help with the menu.  There was an outdoor patio with lounge seating and a fire in the background.  We went out there just to take some pics and the waiter ran out to help with taking some photos.  So nice.  A little goes a long way!\n\nOverall I am pleased!  Well recommended Misti!  It is a little pricey.  Our bill was about $200.  So if money is not an object and your looking for good food and romantic ambiance by all means try this place.  Its also a nice place to just check out for drinks....sit on the patio!"

Don't judge this book by the outside known as the Royal Resort...it's worth the trip!\n\nCheck out the pics...they make my mouth water :"

Kirk, Brian and their staff were efficient, capable and in synch with mine and my guest's needs. I also worked with one of their event staff/coordinators who was equally as amazing (and her name is Ku'uipo). Don't let the lackluster hotel exterior deter you from the cool restaurant atmosphere. Local and out of town guests (did I mention I'm from CA?), don't fret...if you need a uniquely beautiful, high end establishment to host a party then go to The Barrymore.  Their peeps will take care of your peeps!"

Here's what I had: \n\nRoasted Artichoke - It was good and tasty. It was artichoke hearts topped with stuff. I'm not sure why but I was expecting more of a halfed or quartered whole roasted/grilled artichoke. Nonetheless I thought it was good. \n\nPanzanella - I did this for my salad. Ehhh.. Not thrilled by it. I'd go with a reg salad if I were to go back. I know Panzanella isn't salad but I was in the mood.. \n\nFilet - Cooked perfectly. I did the Bearnaise sauce. I do find it odd and slightly tacky when a steakhouse charges extra for sauce. Classes things down a notch for me. I always remember this place I ate (that will remain nameless) where I ordered a big steak, dinner, the whole thing, and I asked for sour cream on my baked potato and they said .75 cents extra, steak was good but that drove me nuts. Perhaps I have baggage when it comes to this.. but I'm just sayin, it bugs me.. \n\nSides - Sauteed spinach and cream corn lobster. Spinach solid and the cream corn lobster is very buttery rich as you would expect. \n\nWe were sat back by the kitchen or at least the dish area and were treated to the noise of falling dishes a couple times. \n\nI liked the style of the place. The service was spot on. I like the bottle of wine. And I had a very nice coffee for desert. I was happy after my meal. After reading the reviews and hearing the hype.. Perhaps my expectations were a little high or we just caught them on an off night. 3.5 in my book but I went ahead and rounded up."

Her husband is a chef, as is mine.  We were getting married in Vegas and wanted the night after the wedding to be an intimate date, away from the 100 loved ones who flew out to celebrate our nuptials....  so the barrymore it was!\n\nInitially, it was going to be just my fussy chef of a groom and me... alas, one of his chef friends and his girlfriend were still in town, and looked longfully at us as we described our plans of eating things I don't normally eat... so a party of five it was.\n\nThe place is amazing.  I don't understand why people have negative things to say about the Royal Resort.  Sure, it's not the Four Seasons or the Wynn, but it's the height of re-done art deco miami coziness.  I loved the lobby, the lighting and the mirrors strung artfully on the wall.  What a great space!  I would totally stay there.\n\nThe restaurant is as folks described - classy, sexy, a beautiful version of what we dream old Vegas was.\n\nOur waiter was nice and helpful.  We ordered cocktails.  We all enjoyed them.  And then.... the food!  We ordered so much... Octopus (the first time I enjoyed octopus!) was tender not chewy, perfectly seasoned... yum.  Watermelon and heirloom tomato salad was a hit - we loved the candied rind.  Veal sweetbreads?  I will ignore what they are and savor each delicious bite.  The pastry with the foie gras was a bit sweet for me, but as a combination, it was amazing!  the vegetarian pasta dish was delicate and understated.  The clams were a bit chewy, but the pepper sauce was great.  The vegetable cous cous dish was probably the only dish that we didn't like too much - it was a bit boring.  While everything else was special and unique, this was ordinary.  Next up were the two entrees that we shared.... were we still hungry?  Not at all.  Does that stop chefs from tasting everything?  Not at all.  We shared the duck two ways and the short rib.  The duck was good, the short rib was EXCELLENT.  Perhaps the best I've ever eaten.  I want another one!\n\nWe were too full for dessert, but our fabulous waiter brought us a celebratory creme brulee.  Tasty.\n\nWhile we like to try different restaurants when in Vegas, we have found one that we'll be back to again and again."

The atmosphere is classy and romantic. \n\nNow for the food. My tuna tartare was unique. I liked it but not sure I've ever had tuna tartare with a spicy kick. I'm quite positive I've never had tuna tartare accompanied by a fried avocado. My pork chop was overcooked and the blue cheese sauce simply overwhelmed it. Wish it wasn't so but it was. My wife's Sea Bass was outstanding. She way out ordered me! Her foie gras was average and the cream corn with lobster was neither creamed nor anything to write home about. The service was attentive and the staff was nice and accommodating.\n\nI liked it okay, but I would not make a special trip to go back.\n\nSlightly upturned face."

If someone wouldn't have told me about this place on Convention Center Drive I would have never found it. Like so many other reviews comment here \" don't judge a book by it's cover\" . The atmosphere was small and intimate. They had a picture frame that played old movies on it, what a cute idea!! \nI went here on Valentine's Day, it was busy for them I guess. It took a while to get my food but, when I got it it was totally worth it! I ordered the the Moroccan shank lamb ( lots of meat here) corn lobster ( this was to die for ) & mushrooms. We had the lobster mac & cheese appetizer to share. This is a very popular item at the Barrymore so I had to try it. Totally worth it!  The sides are large enough for two people to share by the way. If you check-in at the Barrymore on Yelp and show your waiter/waitress that you checked in you can get a free glass of wine.  We took advantage of this offer.  Now my boyfriends meal unfortunately was a whole different story. He ordered some type of steak. I am not a steak person so don't recall the type. It had to be sent back twice because it was not cooked enough :( . The poor waitress felt so bad, & my meal was perfect what do you do?  Well, they did give us a $20 discount on the meal for the trouble . I personally think giving him his meal free would have been one step better since I was completely done with my meal by the time I he got his complete dinner. I would still go back because I enjoyed myself and my meal was great."

Having lived in Las Vegas for nearly ten years, we were familiar with the location of the Royal Resort and had to wonder just how good it could be considering that.  Upon entry our fears of a downscale experience were immediately removed...the hotel lobby was beautifully decorated and spacious.  The Barrymore restaurant itself was gorgeously furnished and appointed.  The space consists of two dining rooms, a bar and a very nice patio area.  The front dining room is light and bright and the rear dining room was darker and had a romantic vibe with big booths.\n\nThe menu was fairly small but still had a great selection with good variety.  We started with a very unique and delicious grilled artichoke.  Then I had a perfectly prepared non-salty French onion soup while my wife enjoyed an interesting salad with hearts of palm, lettuce and tomato with bleu cheese...I forget the exact name of the salad, but I had a bite and it was delish.  We then both enjoyed filet mignon steaks with asparagus and creamed spinach sides.  The steaks also included some peeled tomatoes and a unusual onion preparation.  To make a long story short, all of the food was simply fabulous.  Perfectly prepared with care and very lightly seasoned.\n\nThe service was absolutely first rate, with quick drink replacements, flat and silverware replaced between each course.  Both our actual waitress and the bus person were paying very good attention to us for the duration of our 1.5hr meal.\n\nIn summary, it will be our pleasure to travel from Henderson to enjoy another meal at The Barrymore in the future.\n\nThe only other things I'd note are that they had excellent air conditioning and that was much appreciated on this 109F day and that they no longer offer deviled eggs."

We had the Barrymore Burger for lunch which was as asked medium well and my partner had his medium and both were cooked as requested.  They use a fresh over-sized English muffin for the bun which I could easily see myself eating by itself, but it was also a great compliment to the burger!  The presentation was very nice, the herbed fries came in a mini fry basket, adorable.  We also had breakfast and had the Pork Belly Benedict and the Two Egg Breakfast.  I can not fully put into words at how fantastic the Pork Belly Benedict was.  The eggs were perfectly poached, the sauce light,  the hash browns seasoned with the perfect amount of caramelized onions.  The bacon marmalade, OMG the bacon marmalade!  Yes the pork belly was good too, but I could have probably been served that marmalade alone and still given this review. My partner had the Two Eggs which I was told was also delicious, and I did try a bit of his bacon which had just that exact crunch that I love.  I would absolutely recommend checking this place out."

It has that original Las Vegas feel which is very cool and different from the usual flashy-ness of new Vegas.  It is located in the Royal Resort.  We sat in a very small room that had about 4 different dining parties on a saturday night; very slow.\n\nWe began the meal with a good selection of bread and by sharing a seafood platter.  I highly recommend the seafood platter as an appetizer.  I think it came with 6 oysters, 2 lobster tails, 6 shrimp, and a few other seafood offering.  The shrimp in particular were humongous and very meaty.  One person I dined with had a steak and the other had the french onion soup and a salad.  I went with curry with a side of grilled asparagus.  My meal and the quality of the food were very solid.  I heard good things about my other dining members' meals as well.\n\nThe manager came over a few times to check up on us (not sure if this is usual or just because it was a slow night).

It combined Damascus design with cinematic kitsch, finishing with elegant French trimming, resulting in two dining rooms that made me museum-anxious about bumping things. There was a talented lounge singer crooning hits that ranged from Amy Winehouse to Gershwin standards by the bar, and her dulcet tones were piped into both dining rooms.\n\nThe food was really incredible. Between the two of us, we tried 75% of the menu and there was nothing that didn't just break my heart with its perfection of flavor. However, the champagne used in the Bellini I ordered was really sharp and brutal, tasting like fruity rubbing alcohol rather than champagne brimming with mellow peach.\n\nThe room we dined in had serious mood lighting going on, leaving us to hold hands during dinner so as not to lose one another in the dark. Not a bad thing, all the more romantic, right? Besides, once Barrymore staff drew back the grey diaphanous curtains, there was a spectacular view of the Riviera's rainbow of neon.\n\nThe only question in my mind was why the Barrymore made it so hard to get a table when the restaurant was half empty? We called for a reservation in the evening, and they turned us away. 15 minutes later I noticed a \"book a table here\" icon on Yelp and it said they had a table for multiple times available, so I used that to get a table. When we got there, they told us they'd had a lot of cancellations that evening. Why not just let us have a table in the first place. We were virtually their only customers when we arrived."

What a lavish dinner party it was! Please try not to mind the Royal Resort lobby too much as it is a little on the shabby side. The Barrymore makes up for the desperately needed renovation of the Royal Resort that is located off the strip. \n\nTaking a shuttle bus from the wedding ceremony at the Aria to The Barrymore, pre dinner drinks were held at The Barrymore bar prior to seating. Once our seating was ready we were summoned into the dinning room that is lavish in royal blue table cloths, vintage gold wallpaper, a shiny gold ceiling covered with old film reels and a floor to ceiling wine cabinet that sectioned off the lounge and the dining room. The old hollywood glitz and glam vibe was spot on! \n\nThe beautifully framed dinner menu consisted of:\n\nStarters \nCESAR SALAD\nLOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE \n\nEntrees \nPASTA & SHRIMP\nROASTED CHICKEN \nSHORT RIB \n\nDessert \nCHOCOLATE CAKE \nLEMON CHEESE CAKE \n\nOur table ordered everything except the pasta and short rib, so I was lucky to have tried almost the entire menu. EVERYTHING was exquisite! I initially ordered the Cesar salad as a starter and it was good, but once I tried that lobster Mac and cheese I quickly regretted my decision! Lol Here is where the Barrymore gets 5 stars for service; upon ordering the chicken entree with fingerling potatoes and veggies, we asked our server if it would be possible to pass along any extra lobster Mac and cheeses that might be  laying around, as a side dish. She informed us that there wasn't anything extra laying around, but, the chef could cook us up another lobster Mac and cheese! We were thrilled! And even more thrilled to be served such high quality food! Not like your typical over stocked banquet food with your traditional flavorless meat and fish options laying around in the back. \n\nDuring dinner I asked the manager what the history behind The Barrymore was, as I thought there must be some correlation to Drew Barrymore and her family. The manager informed me that the restaurant isn't ran by the starlit family, but rather named after Drew Barrymore's grandfather. He also shared that they have Drew Barrymore's wine in stock! How cool is that?! \n\nThe chocolate cake was rich. The lemon cheese cake was out of this world. It had little mini lemon wafers on top that offered a zesty kick. Post dessert, heartfelt and humorous speeches were given by the maid of honor and best man. And to finish off the night, the groom gave a thank you speech. The restaurant was kind enough to select bottles of fine tequila to fill the little jarrito shot glasses brought as a present from the Grooms uncle, all the way from Mexico, and  counted as the final toast. \n\nI glanced over at the Bride and Groom and everyone enjoying their meal. I was savoring the moment. Savoring the food and the complete bliss I had for my childhood friend-for the Newly Weds!"

Browsing on yelp led us to Barrymore as a top 3 candidate.  Since this place stops sitting at 10:30 it sealed the deal for us since we running late.  When we arrive at the hotel we start to get worried, its definitely not in the best looking hotel from the outside and parking is in a poorly lit open lot.  However once inside the lobby was nice and into the restaurant we were pleasantly relieved that it looked very nice.  The lighting and layout was nice and cozy.  And the C shaped booths made for a very intimate dinner.  However right outside the window a pool party was going on where we could hear the music also the restaurant had no restrooms , you had to go to hotel restrooms which were clean but not the nicest you'd see in vegas.\nOn to the food...\nbread was great.  Wife's fav was the cracker bread with cheese baked on it.  Mine was the multi-grain bread that had all these different flavors shooting at you... sweet savory salty.  Turns out theres bacon bits and cherries in it!  \nFor the main course we had the bone in rib eye and whole lobster and split the two to share.  The rib eye was excellent!  The most beautiful steak I seen, perfectly chared and juicy and the best steak I have eaten, better than Mastros.  I think they cook it over an open fire.  Steaksauce definitely not needed but their house made Barrymore sauce is delicious with it too.  (their take on traditional steak sauce with more sweet than tang).  The Lobster was excellent too but it was a huge annoyance to have to shell the claws (hardest  lobster shell ever... took forever to extract the meat).  Kinda ruined the mood having to get down and dirty using elbow grease to mash open the lobster with juice squirting out.  The fries were good too.  Shoestring fries are not our favorite but they made these ones perfectly.\nAll in all we loved our time here, I can attest that this place is every bit as good as more expensive Vegas spots."

Though small, the bar and dining room offer a lot of style points packed into your field of vision without being ostentatious or overly busy.  The service dragged at one point, but was overall commiserate with the price point - neither hovering or overly aloof.  The sommelier was also spot on, and offered a great selection off the modestly priced wine list.\nThe not so good part, unfortunately, was the food.  In a word made up of two words: lackluster.  There was not one thing served that lived up to anything above a three star experience.  Both NY strips at the table were difficult to cut at times and nothing approaching what you'd expect at any steak house above a Salt Grass or Outback.  And in fairness to those establishments, I should say that I had no difficulty cutting the steak I've eaten there on rare occasions.  The Bearnaise ordered as an accompaniment did little to liven the affair, tasting of little more than a flat wine reduction. The lobster mac, which is by no means a unique item, fell equally flat.  The wallpaper should not appear richer than an item that practically screams \"ridiculous oozing opulence....with lobster!\"  But it did.  The salmon was cooked wonderfully and was considered a success, though it sat unfinished at the end of the meal.  \nPerhaps we missed the mark by not getting the bone-in ribeye and the sweetbreads instead, but it's only a guess that we'll return to see if lady luck rewards the brave, or further hinders the foolish."

Everything was great and we both agreed that it was quite possibly the best meals we'd ever had. Lobster mac and cheese is a MUST. It looks like a small dish but it just keeps going. We also had the range free chicken and ny strip steak. We finished off the meal with the warm chocolate cake. It was my boyfriend's birthday (which I had mentioned when I made the reservation) and although we didn't get to pick out the dessert, we were blown away. It was so amazing.

Of what we ordered, I tried:\n\nSeafood Appetizer Platter\nBone in Rib-Eye\nCurried Squash\nSteak Tartare\nMashed Potatoes\nAsparagus \nRoasted Mushrooms\n\nThe appetizer platter included muscles, oysters, jumbo shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail. The entire selection was chilled and deliciously fresh. \n\nMy husband ordered the Bone In Ribeye medium rare. The steak was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was excellent. Based on the excellent reviews, I was planning to order the Short Rib, but the Curried Squash caught my eye and I opted for it instead. It did not disappoint!  Next time I plan to try the Short Ribs. My girlfriend ordered the Steak Tartare as her entree. I had a couple tastes of it and it was good, though I'm generally not a fan. The portion was huge and she commented that there was so much of it she kinda got tired of eating it.  We concluded this was because, as an appetizer, it was probably meant to share. \n\nOf the sides, the Roasted Mushrooms were definitely the star. The Mashed Potatoes were creamy and tasted great. The asparagus was pretty standard. \n\nFor dessert I had a very yummy Moscow Mule! It came in the most adorable mug. \n\nA couple notes...Wednesday features a very talented lounge singer which is super fun. The wine list here is outstanding so, if you are a fan of upscale vino, this is your spot.  At about $100 per person, the menu may seem pricey to some especially given the location of this restaurant. In my opinion, you are getting what you pay for in terms of food quality, service, and ambiance. \n\nCan't wait to return!"

The shrimp was soggy and had very little sauce on it.  The bartender and waitress recommended the sea bass, which was bland and boring. I don't understand why there are so many reviews on yelp saying how good it is.  The short rib was tasty and rich but the root vegetable mirepoix was greasy and had an unpleasant flavor.\n\nI wanted so badly to love this restaurant, they have amazing drink specials and a really nice ambiance but the food needs some work."

            "review": "It is unfortunate that the service at this establishment is so terrible, because otherwise it would be a decent place for a meal hidden away from the Strip.  The food was decent, but my experience here for my girlfriend's birthday is what drops their score to one star.\n\nWe came here in a large group and filled up what otherwise would have been an empty dining room on a Saturday.  The waiter, Daniel, tried to chum up to us by claiming he was \"half-Asian\", even though he looked 100% Caucasian.  Regardless of whether he really was of Asian decent, my suspicion is that he was trying to sell us on their overpriced bottles of champagne, which he claimed would be a great way to celebrate the birthday girl w/a toast, and he'd throw in a free dessert too.  One of us brought a bottle of wine, and Daniel said he'd waive the corkage fee ($35) if we got the champagne.  We thought, why not, and ordered his suggestion, the Gruet Rose, priced at $85 (I later looked up the retail price for this, and it's $16.99! What a ripoff).  \n\nOnce we got seated, Daniel's poor service began to show.  We came in near the end of happy hour, but Daniel didn't notify us that it was last call to get cheap drinks.  Instead, when we realized it was near the end of happy hour, instead of encouraging us to go, he gave the impression that he did not want us to make it, even running out to the bar area to let the bartender know that we were too late.  Dinner itself was served very slowly, and I was missing my fork for a while.  Because of the long wait at dinner, we found ourselves bumped up against the clock, and we had to get out of there to attend another engagement.  We waived him down for the check, and in our rush, almost missed seeing that the corkage fee was NOT waived.  Thinking this was a misunderstanding, and a quick fix, we told Daniel, who flat out denied that he'd waive the fee.  We asked to speak to the manager (did not catch his name, but he was old, Caucasian, and had white facial hair), thinking he would have no problem waiving a $35 fee on a meal of more than 1k.  But, nope.  He was even more rude.  We explained the situation in a cool, calm manner, despite being in a rush, but to deaf ears.  Afterall, the gratuity was already included in the bill, so why should they care to give good service?  They also did not bring out the promised free dessert until we specifically asked for it.  Eventually we decided we'd wasted enough time, and basically were forced to pay tip for terrible service, and a corkage fee that should have been waived.\n\nThe whole experience left such a bad taste in our mouths that several of us called up the general manager AFTER we had already returned home from our vacation.  Eventhough the general manager eventually issued refunds for the tip and corkage fee, we had to bug him to get it done.  In any case, this isn't even about the money.  It's about the principle of the situation.  I'm a guy, and I'm used to getting treated poorly.  However, even for me, this was one of the worst dining experiences of my life, and it completely ruined the birthday celebration.  The valet guy outside treated us better than the servers inside.\n\ntldr; worst service ever, ruined birthday, bad management"

First dates?  Romantic rendezvous?  Scandal?

I don't know how he does it, but he always manages to find that special place off the beaten path for dinner.  The Barrymore is located in the Royal Resort, an older Hotel/Timeshare property off the strip across from the indoor skydiving place.  Don't let the exteriors and neighborhood distract you.  Make a reservation and give this place a try.\n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant I felt like we were in a time warp.  The Barrymore has an \"old school\" Vegas kind of vibe.  Seems like a place where people who don't want to be seen would go, like where you'd take your mistress not your wife...to the booth in the back in the corner in the dark.  The dining room was really intimate and cozy, loved the velvet booths, nice touch.  Ambiance 5 stars!  \n\nWe started our evening with cocktails, the room demanded it.  I had the Harvest, it was a nice combination of fall flavors.  The wine list is extensive, you could go balls out and order the Screaming Eagle Cab for 5100 bucks.  For the non \"high rollers\" they offer 50 wines for less than 50 bucks.  We had a great Zinfandel that landed somewhere in between price points and went well with our meal.\n\nOur server Oscar helped us navigate the menu and explain the evenings offerings.  We shared the Lobster Mac and Cheese and Pan Seared Foie Gras starters.  I loved the mac and cheese, really creamy flavors that highlighted the chunks of Maine lobster rather than over power it.  I didn't sample the Foie Gras, but my friends were ooohing and aaahing over the flavors.  They loved it.  For dinner we ordered:  The Buffalo Rib Eye, I eat buffalo burgers often so thought this a good choice for something different, great flavor.  I asked for medium rare, but it came out more rare/raw in the center so most of it was left on the plate.  The Short Ribs were nothing short of amazing, so tender and flavorful, the winning dish of the night if you ask me.  The third dish was a Petite Fillet, my friend said it was like buttah.  We all shared the Asparagus Risotto, crisp asparagus with creamy rice, yum!\n\nNo meal is complete without a little dessert.  After consuming the delicious bread selections, appetizers, and entrees we elected to share a little something.  Kalani chose the Creme Brulee, his favorite and a must try all over the planet.  He was not disappointed with this preparation.  \n\nA great birthday feast for my friend Kalani.  A great weekend in Vegas.  I cannot wait to see what the birthday dinner will be this year....after all, his birthday will be on 12-12-12.  Hmmmm....we've got a few months to figure it out~\n\nBTW,  I saw an amazing cheeseburger and fries walk past during our dinner service.  I'm sorry I didn't make it back for a late lunch to try it out...  Next time I guess..."

            "review": "Was at a convention in Vegas that has a \"dine around\" evening. I always make a special effort with my team to find a great restaurant and dinning experience on a limited ($100 per person) budget. I have people from around the globe (Romania, India, Utah, Seattle, San Jose, Boston, etc) in my group. We have vegetarians, pescatarians, carnivores, and foodies in my team, so its no easy feat.\n\nI couldn't find a reasonable restaurant on the strip (near our convention) and the concierges as The Aria and Cosmopolitan were useless and a total fail. I gave up and finally started searching myself. \n\nI contacted The Barrymore in Novemember and asked if they could handle a group of 20+ since the restaurant is small and if we could please order off the menu (and not get a pre fixe menu since the options are always limited for such a diverse team). They assured me they could accommodate. \n\nI booked on November 13th for dinner on December 16th. When we showed at the restaurant there was a huge crowd inside the bar (past the very cool vault-like door). \n\nThey had apparently lost our reservation. No record of it. I searched my email on my phone and found the response from the restaurant general manager confirming my team (with advanced credit card faxed in).\n\nThe hostess was clearly upset and said she's ask about it and be right back. A few minutes later an assistant manager appeared and again wanted the confirmation. Clearly realizing it was their mea culpa the offered us the patio (on December 16th where it was in the mid to low 40s). They scrambled to make it right. We got a private patio with folding tables but made up nicely with linens. They set up two heaters and we huddled the ladies and folks from India (not used to the cold) around them. We didn't have many jackets but people shared scarves and coats with those less dress.\n\nWe sat and were skeptical. It was cold. People were disappointed. I received a text message from the general manager apologizing for the mix up and admitting it was his fault and promising to make it right. And then they did. The staff and our waiter Luis was great. They made sure we got our order in before the other huge group of 60+ sitting inside did so we wouldn't have to wait outside to long for our dinner. They suggested a great and reasonably priced wine (They have 50 for under $50 and even better when you get a couple of magnums). They food was great. My octopus salad rivaled that which I had earlier this summer in Greece. Everybody raved about the steak. Although my sea bass was heavy on the butter...it was butter so I wasn't complaining. \n\nThis was a great example of an evening that could have gone very wrong and a review that could have been very different. The make of a great business is one that can recognize a mistake, put the customer first, have a professional staff and create an exceptional and memorable evening. I'll definitely go back again next time I'm in Vegas."

In spite to them asking for it to be as rare as possible, it came way overcooked with that yucky gray color that comes with overcooked tuna.

My group started with drinks at the bar.  Service was excellent even if the beer menu left a lot to be desired.\n\nWe opted to eat in the dining room instead of on the patio so we wouldn't be sweating our nuts off while we were trying to look classy.  Will definitely be back to try the patio when it is cooler.  The dining room is small and intimate and nicely decorated.  Very old Hollywood.  Great date spot and I am sure our loud asses ruined a couple of dates that night.\n\nWe started with four appetizers (yeah, I said 4!): Lobster mac & cheese, fried artichokes, lobster deviled eggs and grilled octopus.  I hate mac & cheese but even I liked the lobster mac.  Was not a huge fan of the artichokes but the other 3 made up for it and my friend took care of the artichoke, which she loved.  It doesn't take much for me to love a deviled egg because, in general, deviled eggs are awesome, but this deviled egg really was something special.  Nice lobster flavor and a little dollop of caviar on each egg.  Way to high-class a redneck treat!\n\nSince we had such a mammoth amount of appetizers, we opted to go straight to the main courses.  Two of us had filet mignons and 1/2 lobsters with all 3 of The Barrymore's signature steak sauces (my favorite was the Bernaise).  The lobster was a little overcooked but the steak was excellent and the drawn butter covered the lobster nicely.  I also had a bite of the short ribs and sea bass my friends ordered.  I would have gladly eaten either dish as my meal.  Both were great.\n\nWe also had two bottles of a really good Malbec (can't remember the name) and cashed in my Groupon.  All in all, a great atmosphere, very good food, great service and beyond reasonably priced.  You won't find a better meal at this price point anywhere in town.  Truly a hidden gem in the dumpy litte Royal Resort."

I would never have found the place without Yelp- it's tucked in the side of the lobby of an older hotel, barely a block off the north end of the strip. Quite honestly, the place reminded me of the Hollywood Tower of Terror at Disney's California Adventure-- if Disney decides to theme a restaurant there (like Blue Bayou at Pirates), this could be their model!\n\nThe dining room is quiet and small, with mid-century decor. Gilded film reels across the ceiling and flocked wall paper complete the time-warp feeling. I eat early when I'm solo- so possibly I missed the rush later, but the room was quiet for a Saturday night. Despite this, the service was spot on- not hurried, not absent- very attentive and informative. \n\nI had a good feeling about dinner when a basket of three warm breads arrived. There was a slice of cracker bread, a beautiful mini epis and a small pretzel bread. \n\nThere is a long list of starters, which did not study, as I knew I'd pick the seared foie gras! The plating was interesting- the slice (warm and perfectly seared) was served on a chunk of sherry bread pudding with a caramelized fig. The dish was finished with micro-greens and a drizzle of sauce. The combination was great- especially for someone who has missed this artisan product (btw- give up your factory chickens and eggs before you complain to me about hand raised foie gras ducks...). Try the house special cocktail- The Barrymore- with the foie gras-- a great combination!\n\nI had the seared diver scallops on creamed corn with pesto, and could not resist ordering the corn with bacon and lobster as a side. Yes, it was a bit too much corn, but every bite was delicious. \n\nI am not generally a dessert eater, but the kitchen sent me a beautiful chocolate-raspberry tartlet with a scoop of pistachio ice cream-- the crust was impossibly tender, and the chocolate ganache was delicious. \n\nI'm looking forward to my next visit! I've been to many of the upscale restaurants on the strip- and I have to say this ranks among the best for original and delicious food, and without the snobbery that must sometimes be suffered to enjoy the food!"

This place feels like old Vegas, the days before the \"Celebrity Chef\" phenomenon sucked all the soul out of Vegas eating establishments. We made a reservation on Open Table for a Saturday night at 8pm and when we arrived we were seated immediately inside the main dining room. The entire restaurant seats 50 so it has a chill vibe that is a welcome relief from the neon Disneyland just outside the doors.  \n\nWe ordered the Pan Seared Foie Gras, being from California this dish was a must, and the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Both appetizers were pretty good. Not the greatest Lobster Mac I've had but certainly not the worst either, same with the Foie Gras, had much better but again, since I cant have it in CA it was awesome just to be able to order it. For our entrees we had the Duck Confit and Short Rib, both were excellent and pair incredibly well with our wine. I wish I  could remember the name of the bottle we ordered but the Sommelier was definitely on point.  \n\nI love the decor and ambiance of this place and cant wait to dine here again on my next visit to Vegas."

It's a very intimate, dark setting, and pretty cozy -- I think they only seat 50.\n\nAnyway, we started off our meal with the grilled octopus appetizer, which was superb. Fresh, springy texture yet tender and soft. The seasoning was just right and even though the legs looked charred, they were also quite soft. \n\nFor the main course, I got the duck special, which had duck breast on top of this duck and bean mixture. The breast was very moist and flavorful. The bean mixture had bits of duck mixed in and was also good, though a tad salty. My boyfriend got the Shortrib 'Bourguignon' that comes with carrots, potatoes, and pearl onions. I thought it was quite yummy. The meat was so soft that it pulled apart easily with a fork and the glaze was really tasty. Despite what looked like a relatively small portion of food, the both of us were quite sated, although we always have room for dessert....\n\nWe finished off with the creme brulee -- SO GOOD! It came with a scoop of ice cream, spiced pears, and a sweet chip on top and the carmelized sugar gave such a satisfying crunch when we dug into the custard.\n\nThe only thing was the entrance looks like part of a wall that was partially ajar in the hotel lobby of the Royal Resort and it was kind of heavy, so we weren't sure it was open. If you see this, just pull really hard and be on your way! Also this place is on the North end of the Strip away from most of the action so it's good for a quiet date."

The burger was definitely the standout of the meal so thanks to yelpers for letting us know that we could secretly order it even though it was not on the menu.  We had a few beers to go along with the meal & the total bill just under $100, not bad at all.

Started off with some cucumber mojitos that were light and refreshing...cool as the cucumber muddled in it. I ordered the Dungeness Crab appetizer thinking I was going to have to do some work, however all of the meat was placed neatly on top of a delicious gazpacho type sauce that I thoroughly enjoyed. I even took my spoon and ate the remaining sauce like it was a soup.  For my main I ordered the Vadouvan Squash Curry w/ couscous.  I was impressed with the curry flavor, it wasn't too heavy, but it wasn't light either.  I wondered if there was a bit of coconut milk in it.  Regardless, I ate it ALL! It was time for dessert and I was so full, but I HAD to order something so I went with the Pistachio ice cream- by the way all of their ice cream is house made.  If you like pistachios, you will like this. The Barrymore is off the beaten path, which appealed to me because I really didn't feel like eating at a crowded pretentious restaurant.  Be prepared to spend a lot of money, it is kind of pricey, but it's worth it."

The decor is really intimate and romantic, with big comfy booths and movie reels covering the ceiling.  Our waiter was Israel, and he was really friendly and gave us great service throughout the night.  We had a couple of drinks each, and they were okay, nothing amazing, but strong enough.  We started with the lobster mac and cheese, and this was pretty tasty.  Tons of lobster, and very cheesy, a great dish.  For our entrees, boyfriend ordered the ribeye, and I got the heritage pork chops, along with a lobster tail and cream corn lobster.  The ribeye was fantastic, cooked perfectly and juicy and flavorful.  The pork chops were great as well, a little dry, but still very very flavorful with a delicious au jus.  The lobster tail tasted fresh, and was we polished it off pretty quickly.  I must say, that my favorite part of the meal was the lobster cream corn.  Oh.  My.  God.  So delicious.  The creamed corn was perfect, and there was tons of lobster throughout the dish.  I couldn't stop eating it.\n   The one main issue for the night was when it came time to pay.  I got the bill, and the amount looked right, and I handed over my card.  He took my card away and ran it, and I thought all was well.  However, he came back and told me that he'd actually given me the bill for another table, and that he'd have to take my card to cover the difference.  Fine, of course.  However, instead of charging us the difference between the two bills (the wrong bill rang in about $190, which our actual bill was about $210), he \"voided\" the old transaction and charged the entire $210 to my card again.  Now, we're pretttty low rollers here, and the unexpected $200 extra expense really screwed things up.  I got an angry text from Wells Fargo almost immediately, and questioned our waiter about the transaction.  He told me that the money would most likely be refunded by the next business day (a Thursday), and didn't explain why he didn't just charge me the difference instead of creating a whole new transaction.  Over the next couple of days, the money wasn't put back into my account, but the restaurant was sure to hurry and process the 20% tip that I still provided for our waiter on my card.  Eventually, when I lost faith that they had actually voided the transaction, I called my bank and had them investigate the charges.  The issue was finally resolved the next Tuesday, almost a week after our meal, and well past the \"one business day\" that I was told it would take to void the charge.  Luckily, I had taken out all my cash for my Vegas stay, or else I would've had all my money locked up because of this issue.\n   When all is said and done, we had a fantastic meal at this restaurant, which warranted five stars.  However, the lack of common sense in handling the billing mishap and all the inconvenience that it caused keeps me from leaving them a five star review in good faith.  If I ever did go out of my way to come back here, I would definitely pay in cash."

Off the strip, which could have accounted for it not being crowded, or because the oscars were on that night. \n\nCan't recommend it highly enough. I live in san francisco, so have pretty high expectations, but I think the Barrymore would be a unique spot and highly successful anywhere. Make a reservation in advance and go!"

My brothers very good friend is the sommelier here, and so we decided to check it out. And I have to say it was the highlight of my entire trip. We ordered twp of their specials, the Hanger steak and the Monk fish. They were unbelievable! I mean, the best meal I have ever had. Our friend Chris Banks also sent out some delicious appetizers and paired them with wine.We loved everything he sent! We had the artichokes and the mussles. Again, amazing. The restaurant is at the far north end of the strip just past Encore on Convention Ctr drive, but it so worth the trip no matter where you are staying. And also provides a wonderful break to the chaos that Vegas often has. The atmosphere was refined and relaxing. Our server, Katie, was pleasant, knowledgeable and professional. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to check out this new restaurant!!!!  You will be amazed!"

We finally made our return and wanted to give a review of the place.\n\nAmbiance: Great intimate spot, low lighting and excellent decor around the place.  Very old vegas vibe in the classiness without actually being old and having a great clean feel.\n\nService: Best part of this place is excellent service.  Both waiters we have had were excellent, nice conversationalists, knew their wines and were attentive without being over bearing.  The bussers were pretty quick and ready with water.\n\nFood: The food is pretty rich, but hey, you are here to splurge a little bit.  This is American cuisine, we've had most of the seafood options when we have came so I can't really speak much past that.  Some of the best scallops I have had were served here.  Next time I hope to get the famous Lobster Mac and Cheese.  Though it has the classics there are some adventurous items like Veal Sweetbreads, Muscovy Duck, and fish that we don't always see here.  Give it a go!"

I ended up pretty full, and this was essentially our dinner. \nWe had a party of five and had very comfortable seating on the patio, with just enough room for all of our plates and drinks after a little creative arrangement. The patio itself has an amazing air of privacy and was the perfect temp, with just a sweater after the sun set. \nI recommend the mussels, my fiancee ordered them and they were tender and flavorful and sizeable. The oysters were good, the octopus was perfectly cooked in the nicoise (though I wish there had been some component reminiscent of egg in the classic..) and the Caesar was crisp fresh and just a little different with Serrano ham and a sardine on top. My friends report that the lemondrops they had were also top notch.\nOverall, we ended up spending not very much for 5 people at happy hour.. Average of $30 each plus tip. When you consider the caliber of the food and the fact that we left full on small plates, it is a great value."

The server Israel Lopez has always made me look like a king at the Barrymore.  I was heartbroken to find he had passed away suddenly.

My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious.

The Barrymore is a beautiful little restaurant hidden inside a very sketchy Hotel right off the Vegas Strip. As I walked up to the front door I was a little nervous because I saw the typical douchey Vegas tourists in their flip flops, Tommy Bahama shirts, and golfing shorts..This is a FANCY restaurant..Try to have some class, this isn't Fremont or The Circus Circus Buffet.   \nWe made it in time for our 7:30 reservation, but had to wait,  we sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks and looked around in awe..  Beautiful art works, old Hollywood Glamour furnishings..I felt like I had gone back in time..A time before Ed Hardy, Tommy Bahama, and Tapout... After we waited for a while I finally went back to the hostess stand, and found out that she gave our table away. The VERY TALL manager overheard and promptly bought us a round of drinks for our patience. He made sure that we were happy and well taken care of, especially hearing that we were locals.  I just moved here from L.A. where a manager wouldn't give to shits about giving away your table, so this all came as a shock to me.  We finally sit at our table, I can't stop thinking about how utterly gorgeous everything was..  \n\nO.K.  FOOD!..  We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese ( who wouldn't?! )   It was creamy,rich, and mouthwatering.. I also ordered the kale salad which was also good..but I actually love the Winter Kale Salad @Culinary Dropout 1000 times better..My friends all loved their main courses..but I ordered the Chicken, which seemed like an after thought..it wasn't good..  It was VERY dry and flavourless.  I am looking forward to revisiting The Barrymore, but I will  definitely be getting a different entree or maybe just order two bowls of the Lobster Mac and Cheese. :)\n\nSo visit The Barrymore, but please don't dress like a tacky tourist!"

Presentation, composition, flavor...these dishes had it all. \n\nOur appetizers: Roasted Heirloom Beets (the goat cheese fritters..I die!!), Roasted Artichokes, Lobster Mac & Cheese (my personal Achilles's heel).  The Caesar Salad and French Onion Soup might possibly be the average plates delivered.  Not bad, just completely outshone by the other dishes.\n\nDinner: Diver Scallops, Pan Roasted \"Jidori\" Chicken, Short Rib Bourguignon, Muscovy Duck Confit, Bone-in Aged Ribeye.  There wasn't a stinker in the lot.  All perfectly cooked and seasoned (although I personally would prefer a tiny bit less salt, it did not necessarily taste over salted).  \n\nExcellent cocktail and wine selections, too.

A great hidden gem with Las Vegas history and roots back to the MGM pre Ballys.  Decor and ambiance are spot on. Old Hollywood glam and intimate - I think they place only seats about 50 or so. 5 stars there and another 5 stars to the staff. We made a reservation, seated quickly and taken through the menu. Drinks and waters were kept fresh and anything that was needed or anticipated was provided.  Bacon bread in the bread basket?!? Died and went to heaven. \nWe ordered to start 2 orders of Mac & cheese with lobster, octopus and watermelon salad. Yelpers all raved about the Mac & Cheese so I figured it was a sure win....salt overload which everyone commented on, lost some points there. The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked and the watermelon heirloom tomato salad was refreshing and a welcomed flavor after the salt from the bacon bread and Mac & Cheese. \nOne rib eye ordered with a side of fries- huge portion but over cooked. One chicken dish ordered, a little on the dry side and again a bit salty but incredibly tasty. Halibut - most raved about it and thought it was light and delicate, where another's opinion felt it tasted frozen. Salmon was reportedly Delish.  Other dishes ordered but not memorable. \nThis group of 6 dined at a number of places in one weeks time and the Barrymore was the only one with mixed reviews. \nWill I return....yes!

All of these are appropriate. Velour booths, film reels on the ceiling, celebrity wall art, and bronze eagle statues are all part of the d\u00e9cor. The lights above each booth provides the right amount of ambiance. The background music consisted of easy listening standards and was a conversation friendly volume.\nOn this night it was apparent the rodeo fans have discovered this place as there were many diners wearing hats. \nThe dining room is small by Las Vegas standards but the Barrymore is Large on service. Excellent service was provided throughout our diner experience. First on the scene our head server. Danny greeted us and explained that he will be assisted by two other wait staff members. They worked as a team and there was always someone checking on us, refilling water glasses and clearing plates. In addition the General Manager made the rounds, stopping to chat at each table. He also helped clear. \n\nThe bread basket had a variety of rolls and some cheese flat bread. The standout was the pretzel rolls, simply irresistible. The menu leans to the meat category although there are a few seafood choices. However, I believe this is a place  to go with the beef. Both of us ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon. Mine medium rare and hers well done. The steaks were cooked perfect just as ordered. The size actually appeared to be larger than 8 oz. The grilled asparagus were grilled al dente and had a hint of smoke. The french fries were large pieces made with the skins on. Crisp outside tender inside and grease less."

Great appetizers such as grilled artichoke and lobster Mac n Cheese, to perfectly grilled steaks (had mine Pittsburgh style!) and fresh seafood, this restaurant  is a winner.  Management knows what they are doing and the 50 wines under 50 dollars is a treat too! Give it a try!"

Filet mignon is one of the best I've ever had. Our server Daniel was super friendly & did his best to get us out quickly as we had a show to get to. Best part is the price. For the area almost half the cost of other more touristy restaurants. Hate Vegas but lurrrve the Barrymore!"

            "review": "I really wanted to like this place. During our 3-night stay in Vegas, my husband and I planned one romantic pricy restaurant night, to get away from the craziness of the strip and the casinos. We chose the Barrymore because the menu looked amazing and the restaurant was highly rated. \n\nThe food was indeed fantastic and I would give the Barrymore 5 stars for just the food. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. When we arrived, there was just one other couple finishing up their meal in the restaurant. We ordered our food and wine and while the wine arrived very quickly, the bread took quite a long time. In the meantime, three other large tables were seated, asked for their orders, and were brought bread. Odd, but this is not the reason for by 2 star review. Before moving on, though, I just wanted to mention that one of the breads that they serve has bacon in it. If you're a vegetarian, watch out!\n\nLater, the lobster macaroni and cheese appetizer arrived and was amazing. The problems were entirely in the service of the entrees. My husband ordered a special, and I ordered salmon. Upon ordering, the waiter misheard \"salmon\" and asked if I said \"same.\" I told him that I actually said salmon, and, writing my order down, he reiterated \"salmon.\" What came out an hour later were two of the specials. Not a big deal - we told them that my order was actually the salmon, and the waiter unapologetically whisked my meal away. \n\nFor the next thirty minutes, I watched my husband eat his entree as I sat eating nothing. Now, I'm not in the restaurant business and I'm not sure what the protocol is for an incorrect entree, but I don't think the right thing to do is to leave one person (out of a couple!) with no food, while the other is awkwardly forced to eat his food alone so it doesn't get cold. I took a bite of my husband's dish, and it was delicious, but it was his meal and I was still waiting for mine so I just sat there, staring at my forks, as he uncomfortably ate his meal. Waiters and waitresses passed us and no one seemed to think that this dynamic was odd. \n\nThe cherry on top was when our bill arrived: the restaurant attempted to charge us for two of the specials instead of one special and one salmon. The price difference between the special and the salmon was $15. I pointed this out to the waiter and he very unapologetically said that this was the check for what he thought we ordered. I was actually expecting them to perhaps discount my entree or maybe provide a free dessert as an apology for the awkward meal due to my incorrect entree, but instead they tried to charge me $15 more for my meal!\n\nThis restaurant is quite expensive, and we were spending quite a chunk of change on a full meal with a bottle of wine. In exchange, what we hoped for was a pleasant meal that we could share together. Unfortunately, the Barrymore did not deliver."

The coconut crust cheesecake was my least favorite because it overpowers the yummy cheesecake,I had to scrape it off. Service is nice but too slow for when it wasn't even busy."

It is a true hidden gem in the Royal Resort.  Arrived and got seated right away.  \n\nService was great here.  The manager (or who looks to be the manager) came check on us a few times to make sure we are happy with our food and service.  Our water was always filled and the server check on us often as well.  They truly take the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your meal and service here.\n\nItems we ordered:\n\nMiso Marinated Sea Bass - Yums!  The sea bass is cook and flavored to perfection.  The season was just perfect that you can still taste the sea bass.\n\nCream Corn and Lobster - This is probably my favorite dish.  Not as creamy but it is perfect.  Delicious dish that I recommend.\n\nLobster Mac-n-Cheese - Another delicious dish.  I would say that this is one of the best I've had.  Very creamy and cheesy with chunks of lobster.  \n\nWill definitely come back to this place and try other items on the menu next time I visit Vegas."

We finished off the last hour of the party with the sliders and chicken fingers, which were also a huge hit.  My guests were incredibly impressed with the quality of food, especially given that it was a large cocktail party.  My bf and I ate there a few times before we had the party and based off those experiences decided to have the party there.  If we had had the party somewhere else, like a restaurant on the strip it would have cost thousands more.  Some of our guests were a little put off when they first got to the Royal Resort, but were blown away when they got into the restaurant.  The service was impeccable as always.  Even when we had only gone there a few times before the party the GM, hostess and bartenders already knew our names.  I recommend this restaurant for regular dining but also for large parties.  Sometimes smaller local restaurants struggle with executing larger party's, but that was definitely not the case here."

The dinning area is small but they didn't try to pack it with tables which I really liked.

Lobster mac and cheese solid.  Rib eye steak ordered medium.  Got it so rare that the inside was cold.  Ask the waiter to take it back to cook longer.  Get it back 5 min later, charred black on the outside, inside still super rare and cold.  It taste like lighter fluid, I spit it out, told the waiter it was still cold and ask him to take it away, and to just bring me the check.  He didn't apologize, just brought the bill.  Someone needs to teach the cook how to prepare a steak.  I won't be back, you shouldn't bother going."

The restaurant is connected to the hotel and tucked on the left hand side (when facing it). When I first arrived I couldn't help but get instantly excited with the all-around ambiance of the restaurant. I'm a sucker for boutique-type restaurants and The Barrymore was just that. Dark velvet booths, low dim lighting, damask patterned wallpaper, with some vintage furnishing. Imagine old Hollywood clashing with modern couture. They had a singer who would come around to tables to see a quick little something, and give a birthday shout out. Here comes the star knocker...apparently my boyfriend had put in a special request with the singer and paid him extra just to come by our table and sing a Beatles song. Sadly it never happened. Such a shame because that would've given my man like 100 brownie points. \n\nWe started off with the lobster mac & cheese, of course. I'd have to say it was THE BEST lobster mac & cheese I've ever had. I'm not the biggest fan of this dish in general since it's always so rich and heavy on the cream, but it was definitely exceptional at The Barrymore. The flavor was rich with a strong taste of lobster bisque. There was a generous amount of lobster in it and although it was heavy on the cream, it was most definitely very enjoyable. I literally had to take a second to compose myself just now, because my mouth instantly starting salivating and I'm beginning to drool. \n\nFor the main course I went with the sea bass. Most places overcook the fish with the fear of it being undercooked, but it was cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with some green beans and cauliflower, both very good as well. But in all honesty, just go straight for the duck. That was what the BF ordered. I secretly wanted to trade but I do that at almost every meal, and asking him to trade his duck for my fish would be too cruel. As side items, I ordered the cream corn. Skip it. It was bland and not as enjoyable as I'd hope for. We also ordered the mushrooms, carrots, and mash potatoes as other side items. All decent, nothing to really rave about.\n\nAs a send-off, we were given mini macaroons which were decent, but I really appreciated the gesture. Other than that, I don't have much to say about the service. It wasn't bad at all, not anything out of the ordinary worth mentioning.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my birthday dinner at The Barrymore. If I had a Beatles song sung to me, it would've truly been as good as it gets!"

The atmosphere is upscale and cozy.  The restaurant is a  bit dark and in order to read the menu I did have to make use of the flashlight app on my cell phone.\n\nFor starters we had roasted heirloom beet salad and an order of pan seared  foie grais .  The salad was great if you like beets (and I do).  Nice portion and because of the pistachios   and goat cheese it was a nice mix wonderful flavors and textures.  The very generous portion of foie grais was rich and flavorful and served with toasted pecans and a sweet potato pastry.\n\nDinner entrees where duck confit and lobster thermidor with a side of creamed corn w/lobster. The duck confit was the best I have ever had. Rich and flavorful served atop creamy farrow.  I have no idea what creamy farrow is, but it was yummy and a complimented the duck very nicely.  The lobster thermidor was the least favorite dish.  It was more of a lobster  stew served in a lobster shell.  It wasn't bad, just not what we were expecting. We have had lobster thermidor in a variety of places and this was very different. Again not bad just different.  The lobster was allegedly 2.5 pounds. I don't think so but the portion was filling and the flavors rich.\n\nWe finished up with vanilla bean cheesecake and cr\u00e8me brulee. Both were good, but neither stood out and I wished I hadn't spent the calories or the carbs.\n\nOverall this place is a winner.  Great food, great service, perfectly lovely atmosphere and great pricing. The food quality, portions and presentation are top notch and we have added this establishment to our list of favs."

It's also reasonably priced for this level of dining. My fiance and I each had an entree, a drink, we split a salad, appetizer and a desert and the bill was just under $100. The food was perfection--nicely balanced and not overdone and very creative. The best thing at The Barrymore may be free: the bread they serve. I especially loved the bacon and cherry roll. \n\nWe started off with the grilled artichoke--a must have. We just had the regular house salad, and I wish all house salads everywhere had this much creativity put into them. The dressing is light and savory, and there was also shaved fennel and some of the freshest grape tomatoes I've eaten in Vegas. \n\nI had the swordfish, which was $22 and served on a bed of fresh fava beans with Brussel sprouts. Everything was cooked just right. My fiance had a special: pasta bolognese. The pasta is fresh and the sauce, authentic.   \n\nThey also have a good wine list and affordable wines by the glass, but if you like the hard stuff, try their specialty drink, The Barrymore, which is what my fiance had. I had the Au Bon Climate pinot noir, which was about $12-definitely worth it. \n\nWe loved it all: the decor, ambiance wine, service and the price.

This time I made a reservation way in advance to spend my birthday celebration.  \n\nI originally thought I'd treat myself to a birthday dinner at Jose Andres' \"E\" at The Cosmopolitan.  However, after reading the stellar reviews, I would walk away from that experience anywhere from $200-350 none the richer.  It may be all the hype, but I want bang for my buck.  \n\nI believe I got a lot of bang out of The Barrymore.  An intriguing find off the Strip, housed in the Royal Resort.  Part hotel and part time share.  Our African taxi driver hadn't heard of the restaurant before, let alone was vaguely familiar with the hotel itself.  We made it fine.  We had no problem being in \"the shadier\" part of town, which many reviews here allude to (not sure why).  Also, the hotel wasn't shady at all.  It's not your grandiose hotel with a billion dollar entrance.  It's pretty much like a Holiday or Days Inn via HGTV makeover with modern touches to hip up the place.  There was a happening bar in the lobby that looked like a great place to chill.  Right off the back I knew I was going to love this place because it's so anti-the Strip and off the beaten path.  A more mellow and humble response to being in Vegas.  Yes, it's possible.  \n\nThe ambiance was retro cool with an intimate waiting area and a cozy bar that was crowded.  We were brought to our booth in the main dinning room that had rich, velvety wallpaper, ink blotch art work revealing classic actors and the ceiling was decked out with 35mm film reels.  The entire ambiance harked of classic Hollywood.  Ambiance:  5 stars!\n\nOur experienced waiter, Oscar, greeted and checked with us a few times to help with suggestions and highlight popular dishes.  The manager, Brian, took the time to introduce himself and ask our opinions of the restaurant thus far.  Even the bread guy came by and introduced himself.  Actually a great touch that set a more intimate tone and you could tell everyone had a sense of pride in what they were offering.  What the bread guy brought us was just phenomenal!  Among the lavosh, were cranberry & bacon rolls and a Stromboli that was to die for!  Geez, bring me a bottle of wine and a few more of these babies and I'm frickin' set for the night.  Service:  5 stars!  Bread:  5 stars!\n\nOur party of three started with a couple appetizers:  1)  Lobster Mac & Cheese - mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce (5 stars!)  Wow!  You'd think that the lobster flavor would get lost in all the rich creaminess going on; wrong, the flavor was upfront and probably one of the best mac and cheese dishes I've ever tasted; 2)  Pan Seared Foie Gras - vanilla bean french toast, fig & cherry chutney (5 stars!)  Amazing medallions of heaven that paired excellently with the savory sweetness of the chutney; like buttah!\n\nEntrees were:  1)  The Buffalo Rib Eye (3 stars).  Ordered medium rare, things started off fine and tasted great, but ended up being rare to blue rare as you got to the center.  This was my friends' dish and she was impressed with the flavor, but wasn't able to eat most of the overly rare part.  2)  Short Ribs (5 stars!)- carrot mousseline, red pearl onion, bacon marmalade, natural jus.  I love my short ribs and this one was stellar!  Fall apart texture all in a groovealicious reduction sauce.  This went well with the Asparagus Risotto (5 stars!) that I shared with a friend.  3)  The Fillet Mignon that my friend had, he described as \"beautiful\" (5 stars!).  \n\nWe were totally stuffed by the time dessert came around.  My eyes were way too big for my stomach as I ordered the delectable Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e that had specks of vanilla bean, glorious in all regards (5 stars!).\n\nA wonderful birthday treat and I'm thrilled I decided to spend it here.  A 360 from the usual, over-the-top Vegas that ended up being the most down to earth experience of the weekend.  Not to be missed!  Come here for the substance so many on the Strip promise.\n\nTally:\nAmbiance:  5 stars!\nService:  5 stars!\nBread:  5 stars!\nThe Buffalo Rib Eye:  3 stars\nShort Ribs:  5 stars!\nAsparagus Risotto:  5 stars!\nFillet Mignon:  5 stars!\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e:  5 stars\n5+5+5+3+5+5+5+5= 38/8= 4.8 stars."

And without the doorman pointing us in the right direction we may not have known the big white door lead to the restaurant itself.  But thankfully we found our way in to the restaurant.  \n\nThere is a nice bar with a vintage feel to it, and an outdoor area as well.

The room has a feel that a lot of interesting stuff has gone on over the years here.\n\nI am not usually a fan of the shellfish towers as they never seem to be worth the price but The Barrymore's version is a must get.  Crab claws, oysters, New Zealand mussels, shrimp, lobster all tasted great and fresh.  We had a couple of very good salads and then we all opted for various seafood dishes that were prepared deliciously.  In addition to some nice cocktails, the wine list was interesting and there were several reasonably priced options (the sommelier was quite helpful).  We didn't get to sample dessert as we were late for a show but that gives us another reason to come back.\n\nThe Barrymore offers a great option for a very nice meal off the Strip.  It is well worth finding it."

It's stumbling distance to/from the Wynn or Slot's of Fun depending on how fancy pants you are feeling afterwards. I just can't say enough good stuff about it from the outdoor lounge to the beautiful leather interior.  It's very intimate and the steaks are just incredible. I had to be restrained from gnawing on the bone  with my bare hands by the wife.  You could pay more on the proper strip for a lesser meal with a \"named chef\" or you could go to a place like this which is definitely a unique Vegas experience. What an oasis in tourist hell. This will be a mandatory annual pilgrimage from now on."

My husband and I came here last night and loved it.\n\nIt's a nice, simple, old-school place when you're looking for something classic. We shared the grilled octopus appetizer which was perfectly tender. I had the filet with French fries and my husband had the Kobe flat iron with creamed corn. Both were delicious and cooked exactly how we wanted.\n\nI'm a pastry chef, who normally avoids dessert, but I have to rave about the chocolate praline macaron dessert. It was a large size chocolate macaron with hazelnut chantilly, sugared hazelnuts, caramel sauce, and a tuile. It was sooooo good that I wished I would've gotten another.\n\nExcellent place that we'll definitely return to next time we come to Vegas."

It's only an appetizer and I only wish they had it as an actual entree. My boyfriend had the Short Rib Bourguignoni... I had the Muscovy Duck Confit... and we shared a side of the Cream Corn & Lobster. Everything we ordered for our meal was DELICIOUS... including the complimentary bread basket they give you.

If I had to pick at something, the location is definitely off the beaten path - although that can be a plus to some people.

I've been in and out of every casino, seen most all of the bars and restaurants and even hung out at a few of them without being overly impressed. Last night my wife and I attended a Yelp event at The Barrymore and to say I was blown away is an understatement.\n\n  The Barrymore is located in the Royal Las Vegas which quite frankly has never been known as a Vegas hotspot. In fact, The Royal has mostly been known as a place that folks stayed when they couldn't get accommodations elsewhere. A couple years ago we went to a timeshare presentation at The Royal and listened to the salespersons story about how the resort was being rehabbed. I took this tale with a grain of salt and passed on a purchase. Needless to say my opinion of this tucked away spot has changed completely after last night. \n\n  Upon entering the lobby of The Royal I was taken aback by how nice the place was. The decor had been updated since my last visit with an art gallery and a cool looking sports bar/lounge adorning the interior. As we approached The Barrymore I could see that this place was no ordinary Vegas tourist trap. When we walked in we immediately took note of how classy the place was. The designers were obviously going for an early Hollywood feel and in my humble opinion they hit it out of the park. The bar was packed on this particular night, but the service was great. There is a flat screen behind the bar playing old Hollywood movies and a large glass wall that leads to the outdoor seating area. The outdoor area is large enough for about 20-25 people to sit and plenty of space to mingle and enjoy a nice spring evening. There is also a fire wall which really set-off the exterior d\u00e9cor. It was definitely an ultra-cool patio.\n\n  Returning to the inside we decided to check out the restaurant area since they weren't serving guest yet. WOW! In a word, this place is plush! Huge black leather booths, old school gold movie projector reels adorning the ceiling and a glass wall which allows diners to peek into their extensive wine storage room. It is the kind of place that reminds me of old Vegas when people wore suits and gowns out for the evening as opposed to today when the weekend warriors trudge in and take over the town. \n  In a wonderful twist of fate for anyone reading this review there is a Groupon deal out today (3/05/12) $25 for $50 worth of menu items at The Barrymore. I would highly suggest that you buy one and go check this place out. I can't wait to go back to eat there and have a drink out on the front patio. It won't be long for The Barrymore to find its place firmly on the list of Vegas hot spots."

Unfortunately, The Barrymore was my first negative experience at a restaurant in Vegas.  It's located inside a hotel off the strip that I've never heard of.  I was part of the large party of 14 very unhappy people (see all 1-star reviews below).  It might seem like my friends and I are abusing our power as Yelpers but I rarely write 1-star reviews.  As an elite, I recognize the power of Yelp, it could make or break a business.  My point is that I try to be reasonable, so trust me when I say that The Barrymore isn't worth a trip off the strip.  The location, atmosphere, service, and most importantly food is just not up to Vegas standards.\n\nI'm not going to reiterate my party's experience with their painfully slow and unprofessional service.  You can read all about that in the reviews below.  I'd like to just talk about how ridiculously overpriced and solidly mediocre the food was.  I had the sea bass special.  My dish came with risotto, jumbo prawns, and a lobster tail.  I know it sounds delicious but too bad it wasn't.  The sea bass was unseasoned and sat on a bed of oversalted pea risotto.  The prawns were big but were dry and flavorless.  Same with the lobster tail - dry, rubbery and flavorless. The only ingredient that tasted fresh in this dish was the sea bass.  I tried their Kobe flat iron steak and yet again it was unseasoned and bland bland bland.  It was not juicy, just a sad-looking, flavorless piece of steak on a plate.  I tried my friend's Brussels sprouts with bacon and I didn't even taste the bacon, it just tasted like oil.  By the time the lobster mac came around to me I already lost my appetite so I didn't try it.  I never turn food down so the fact that I willingly chose to skip on eating lobster mac n cheese just tells you how bad it was.  Not only was the food disappointing but so was the service.  There are just too many great restaurants in Vegas to even consider this one.  I forgot to mention that my dish was $80 and the steak was around that price range also.  What a waste, I would've had a much better time spending that at the craps table."

Yes, it's good, but not OHMYGODDDDD TEAR MY EYEBALLS OUT GOOD!\n\nThe Barrymore is inside the Royal Casino (Convention Center Dr. between Paradise & Las Vegas Blvd.; across from Ross & Walgreens).\n\nAs we were trying to find a parking spot (no valet) we were approached by a very pushy homeless man that wanted to crawl into my trunk.  Then when my husband gave him $10 he looked at me and wanted another $5.  Ugh, greedy mother-fer!\n\nWhen you walk into the restaurant, there is a bar with a TV and a few tables.  You can get food served to you in there if you can't get a seat in the dining room.\n\nAnyways, I had made a reservation for 7:30pm.  We got there a few minutes early and we were seated right away in the dining room.  There was ONE other table there!  I was surprised for a Friday night that they were so empty!\n\nWe were greeted by the waiter that was waiting for us and promptly got us a glass of Riesling ($8).  \n\nWe ordered:\n\n*Crispy Fried Outer Banks Calamari ($13) w/ romesco sauce, herbs & lemon.\n- The waiter said the romesco sauce was new.  It's orange in color would make you think that it might be spicy.  It's good.  I could not put my finger on what the flavors were exactly, but they complemented the calamari.  The batter on the calamari is light.\n\n*Shrimp Cocktail ($14) w/ barrymore spicy cocktail sauce.\n- You get 3 VERY LARGE shrimp that were FULL in flavor!  Delicious!\n\nThe waiter brought out some bread.  My husband really liked the bread with cherries and bacon in it.  He said that it was better than Vintner Grill's!\n\nFor our entrees:\n*Crispy Pork Belly ($23.50) braised with Korean flavors, kimchee fried rice, ginger carrot emulsion.\n- Now I went COMPLETELY against everything, since I typically HATE pork but ordered it anyways.  It was delicious!  Now, it wasn't crispy, like I was thinking, but it had a nice sear to have a slight crunch to it.  The fried rice was a perfect complement to all the Korean flavors.  yum!\n\n*Chicken Mole (special)\n- This was one of the specials of the night.  The chicken was extremely tender!  The husband ordered this one.  He said that it was good, but next time he would order the pork belly!\n\nThe service was very good.  We constantly had people checking on us- a few managers, waiter, bus boy.\n\nAll said & done, our bill $100, definitely not bad for a night out.  We looked at the dessert menu, but nothing caught our eye, so we bounced out.\n\nThe decoration was gorgeous!  Very rich looking wall paper and reels on the ceiling.  Loved the chic look of the entire restaurant!\n\nIn the hotel, there is a table hockey that the husband and I were going to play, but apparently someone stole the balls and they weren't going to replace them.  Weird!\n\nI would maybe go back for lunch, but I think I would rather just go for a few drinks and some appetizers, as most of the appetizers sounded good to me!"

Overall, it was just an 'okay' experience.\n\nWe did not get what we payed for, and believe me, we have no problem paying for good food. We ordered the pork belly and also the cream corn with lobster for appetizers. The pork belly was very flavorful but it was a bit salty. It only came with one slice. I couldn't taste the lobster in the cream corn. The cream corn lacked cream and flavor and was also a bit dried.\n\nOur entrees did kinda make up for the appetizers. We got the bass and the duck. They kinda overdid the lemon on the bass but other than that it tasted pretty good. The duck was pretty good as well. \n\nOut of everything, the service was probably the worst. It wasn't super busy at the time that we went. There were 3 different servers, and not one of them checked up on us throughout our dinner. No smiles and just kept walking past us. They never filled up our waters. They never offered a dessert menu. Seemed like they didn't wanna be there. I did notice that it was the same service for the tables next to us as well so it wasn't just us. If we're paying this much, I expect the service to be top-notch. I'm sure if we came on another day and there's different servers and if we ordered other items on the menu, we would have a better experience. Good to try once but because of the experience that we had, we won't be returning."

Desserts seemed a little foo-foo so we passed on those. Our waiter was the perfect combination of attentiveness without hovering. LOVED the glass of free champagne I got for checking in on Yelp. So - to recap. The place is awesome. The food is awesome. The service is awesome. Like others said, don't be fooled by the outside or entrance. 2 thumbs up!"

The one problem is my husband and my ($7 each) baked potatoes seemed rotten/stale and weren't very good. The presentation of the food was all great. The drinks were very pretty and nice concoctions. Our server was attention and friendly. We were celebrating a birthday and they treated us great. Everyone in our group was happy with their meal and experience overall.

We tasted only a few of their cocktails and small bites.\n\nIt's located inside the Royal Resort on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Convention Center Dr. It looks cozy and inviting from the outside with a long fireplace against the exterior wall. Once you walk inside the Royal Resort, you make a left to enter the restaurant.\n\nThe inside is stunning. Dark, vintage like decor. Makes a very intimate dinner/drinks setting.\n\nThe hostess greeted us right away and asked if we had reservations. We told her didn't and requested to sit at the bar which was completely empty on a Tuesday night. Our bartender, Corey, was friendly and had a very impressive mustache! He engaged with us in conversation and provided several useful recommendations.\n\nFor a drink I went with The Barrymore (big surprise I know!) which is their take of an Old Fashioned ($14). Strong and tasty not to my surprise with the zest of orange to add some flavor.\n\nCorey told us the chef created an updated menu that launched 4 days ago on a Friday. The chef changed up a few menu items and we were excited to be one of the firsts to try. We decided to order the Grilled Octopus and the pan seared Foie Gras. \n\nThe Grilled Octopus ($17) had a charcoal grilled taste to it and was INCREDIBLY soft! It was a large portion of an octopus leg and was very tender. I'm not too familiar with octopus being prepared this way (I'm used to chewier, smaller pieces of octopus and squid legs) but I enjoyed this dish very much. It came with lentils and a piece of sausage. I was a little confused with this pairing but the sausage flavor went nicely with the octopus. \n\nThe pan seared Foie Gras ($24) was a small portion of duck liver that came with an apple sauce like substance and a tiny piece of ginger bread. The taste of duck liver was very strong in my opinion and I couldn't taste much seasoning on it. Luckily the sweetness of the apple sauce helped calm down the duck liver taste.\n\nThe Barrymore is definitely a pricier restaurant to visit but I really enjoyed my experience here!\n- 5/5 for the ambiance and service \n- 5/5 for the cocktail \n- 4/5 for the Grilled Octopus \n- 3/5 for the Foie Gras \n\nI would love to come back and give their dinner entrees a try. Perhaps a steak and another whiskey drink!"

I was still a bit skeptical when we rolled in to the royal resort by taxi and I could tell by the look on the face of one in my party that she was a bit scared. When we got inside, I knew it was going to be good. We started on the patio for drinks. Everybody was having a good time and our drinks were great! O.K. Everybody was loosening up a bit, feeling a bit better about my choice. Our waiter came over and he was awesome. Very attentive and knowledgable. He made recommendations, was funny an really added to the feel of the place. \nFirst the bread basket came out. The pretzel roll was delicious! I ordered the bone in rib eye and it was spot on. Fantastic steak! Across the board, our dinners were great. \nOne of the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas. I don't eat at too many places twice in Vegas but I will definitely return to the Barrymore. Fantastic!"

It was a quick $6 cab ride from The Venetian and the restaurant was amazing!  Great food!  Great service!  Great atmosphere!  We had an awesome server (Katie?  Blonde?) who explained everything to us and was so friendly.  We had 8 people in our party and had everything from the $15ish burger to the $65 cowboy ribeye and everyone was happy.  We all agreed the cowboy was the best steak any of us had every tasted, worth every penny!  Do not pass up the roasted artichoke app!  I don't know how they cook it but it was the most fantastic thing I had ever tasted!\n\nSome of our party spent $20 each and some spent $100, great price range!  Also, the less expensive options were still presented and cooked with the same care as the most expensive!\n\nWe wish we lived in LV so we could eat here every night!\n\nI can't say enough great things about The Barrymore!  Try it and you will not be sorry!\n\nOnly disappointing part of the night is that they are no longer serving the Smore's!!!  It looked so good online : ("

Perfectly prepared food and portions, stunningly beautiful and elegant decor, fabulous service...it was a 5-star dinner all around!  I had the filet mignon and mushrooms, and my hubby had the diver scallops - both dishes were superb.  We also had the squash curry dish as an appetizer (although it's an entree) and it was very delicious - would be a great entree for a vegetarian.

Under those circumstances I'm usually going based on price more than anything else.\n\nOne of the few exceptions to that rule is The Barrymore. I went there with my wife on a Groupon and we liked the place so much, we had our second anniversary dinner there.\n\nAdmittedly, I haven't tried a lot of the menu. On both occasions I had the lamb (which is my favorite lamb dish in town). The mac and cheese is very good and I enjoyed the frog legs as well. Finally, their deserts are, in my opinion, just the right size to close a meal and each one has been a treat.\n\nThey also have bacon cherry bread. This stuff is great. If you go, have it and then have some more.\n\nThe interior has a nice old-school look to it and our service has been very nice both times. It's not crowded and parking is never an issue at the Royal Resort either.\n\nAbout the only negative I can give the place is the view is pretty bad. On my first visit my wife and I joked about it with the waiter since we had a window seat. On our second trip, we noticed that the windows were covered and I have some feeling that's why."

I made a 5:30 reservation through Open Table and noted both the birthday and our need to leave by 7 PM to make our show.  Even though we were about 10 minutes late, they got us out on time.  The host and our server were both aware of the birthday and the time constraint (without any prompting.)\n\nOur server Bill was impeccable.  The perfect balance of charming, personable, professional and communicative.  He checked in at all the right times, was prompt and confident with recommendations and questions, and made sure the timing of every aspect of our meal (drinks, appetizer and entrees) were spaced appropriately and yet delivered promptly to keep us on schedule.\n\nThe restaurant decor was charming and cozy (it's a small place, so I'd strongly recommend reservations.)  It's located in a rather rundown casino, but the restaurant itself would be worthy of a spot in any high-end casino.   Your money spent here is clearly going into the quality of the food and the service rather than their rent.  It's actually quite easy to get to by Vegas standards.  You can park in a surface lot immediately adjacent to the hotel, walk into the hotel, follow signs to the left side of the lobby, and voila, you're there!  It took less than 5 minutes to park and get to our table, a rarity for dining at most restaurants inside most casinos.\n\nThe food - also amazing.  I never order lobster mac n' cheese (not really a favorite) but due to Yelp, we tried it, and did not regret it.  Creamy rather than gooey, fresh little bits of lobster throughout....YUM!\n\nFor our mains, we had the duck (out of this world, I was making little noises of delight) and the short rib (he was awfully quiet, which always means he's really loving it.)\n\nMy cocktail was interesting, and his wine was fabulous.\n\nWe loved every bit of the Barrymore.  Thank you equally to the kitchen and to the dining room for making it a memorable birthday dinner!"

This restaurant is not on the strip inside some fancy shmancy hotel, it's a bit off the strip pass Wynn but not far at all. We walked from our hotel (treasure island) and it took around 20-25 minutes. It is a restaurant inside of an hotel and once you walk into the hotel lobby the restaurant is to the left. Walking into the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess right away and they bought the three of us to a booth inside. It was a very simple yet elegant restaurant. They have a display of wine in glass cases and it was beautiful. \n\nBefore coming to the restaurant we did our research (ie yelped all the pictures, read some reviews and tips, and memorize the menu) so before the server ask if we had any question we already had a good idea about what we were gonna order. Of course we still asked for recommendations especially with the drinks because that's one menu we did not memorize. After ordering drinks for the table they bought over some bread and butter. The bread was so good...I don't know if we were famished from a day of clubbing but it was so good but I had to control myself so I can fit in all the other food. \n\nFor appetizer we ordered the seared foie gras to share! GET IT!!! Shoot you should get two of it! It was perfectly seared and the bread that it came with made the perfect combination. For entree my friend got the Chilean sea bass and I got the steak with my other friend and we shared the Mac and cheese as a side. ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE! It has the perfect crunch on top of some gooey cheese giving you a crunch with each bite. My steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way I like it. My friends Chilean sea bass was also amazing, very fresh and the miso glaze was just right, not too heavy or light. \n\nNext time you're in Vegas give this place a shot, the prices are fairly cheaper compared to all those other fancy restaurant on the strips and you get an amazing meal with wonderful accommodating servers."

This isn't a place you wear Converse to.\n\n***HINT***\nAlways look at what the hostess of any restaurant you go to is wearing...this will help you with knowing if your attire is appropriate. If she's dressed up, you should be too.  In fact if there is a hostess, that means you shouldn't be wearing sweatpants!\n\nAnyway, the hostess was wearing heels! How does she do that??? The wait staff was excellent! A manager came over to ask how our experience was. \n\nI got a drink called a cherry picker. DELISH! I'll have five.\n\nThe bread...AMAZEBALLS. This is a classy joint so the word AMAZEBALLS might be frowned upon to describe bread but...oh well. I am going to tell you the pretzel rolls are the best in the basket, next are the large triangle Parmesan crunchy bread things. Lastly we had some other not so terrific dinner roll of some kind.  It was artful and attractive but not as appetizing as its looks would have you believe.\n\nI got the Alaskan Halibut, my friends ordered the chicken and the steak. We were all very pleased!  However, the place is a bit pricey for the portion. My halibut was a wallet busting $27.00.  It only came with vegetables. This price does not include a salad or any more interesting hearty sides.  I feel this plate was overpriced by a good $8-10. But I pay for the swanky this isn't Macaroni Grill!\n\nDessert.  If you have read my other reviews which are all useful, funny and cool btw..you know me. We are BFF'S and you know me no likey the chocolate...but guess what I did...I ordered the chocolate cake.  And it came with milk chocolate sorbet and I want more. It was so good. Hazelnut sauce was drizzled all over it. My friends ordered the chocolate cake too and the amaretto cheesecake. (As a cheesecake fan I thought it was edible but not spectacular).\n\nThere was not a single crumb left (save for the crumbs in front of me that the server CONSPICUOUSLY came by to wipe away between courses. Yes, I am a messy eater, you can't take me anywhere nice!) on our plates. We all ate everything (the portions are small, but at least you aren't wasting food and not going to where you are going overly full with a food baby.\n\nMy only complaint is, the online menu didn't entirely match what was on the actual menu, it needs to be updated to match the seasonal menu because I kind of wanted the chocolate pear torte which wasn't offered. (I swear I don't care that much for chocolate!!!) or the croissant bread pudding."

Let's start with the service, our waiter was lovely and attentive from the moment we sat down. Soon after, the manager came over and introduced himself and told us a bit about the restaurant and invited us to have a look around (as there are two separate dining rooms). The decor of the restaurant is stunning, you expect to turn around and see Dean Martin sipping a cocktail at the next table. Old school Vegas to a T.\n\nSpeaking of cocktails...the cocktail list was fantastic! I am a Jack Daniels fan so needless to say, I was thrilled the signature cocktail \"The Barrymore\" featured Gentleman Jack. It was outstanding, as was the Batida Leblon which was completely different but still tasty.\n\nNow, the best part...the food! Great breads to kick off the meal with a cherry/bacon roll (yup!) and crispy, seasoned flat breads. The pan roasted chicken with pea/carrot risotto was unbelievable. So fresh and simple but delicious. My friend had the crispy pork belly and was raving about it days later - said it is the best she ever had. For dessert, we had the special which was a pear creme brulee...just fantastic.\n\nThis was hands down, one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas and was a highlight of our trip. Oh yea, it is super reasonable too! Go and enjoy!"

We were seated in the smaller of the two dining rooms shortly after arriving. It was a last minute decision because we realized the Groupon was going to expire the next day, so we had the kid in tow for an early (6ish) dinner.\n\nWe went with two soups to start. The French onion soup ($8.50) is traditional in appearance and as good as any other version we've tried in town. The vegetable curry soup with crab ($7) was a daily special not listed on the menu that was poured table side. The smooth and rich soup was loaded with a spiciness that was moderate in heat, yet bold enough to satisfy.\n\nNormally, their lounge menu isn't available in the main dining rooms, but they were kind enough to make an exception for our kid, who wanted their chicken fingers ($10). The order was larger than expected, with four substantial strips of lightly breaded chicken and a mound of crispy skinny fries.\n\nAfter visiting all the other Block 16 spots, I've noticed that one of their most popular accompaniments to their dishes is their bacon marmalade. It can be found on their burgers at LBS and Holsteins and a few dishes at Public House. You can't really blame them, though because it adds a sweet, smokey flavor to dishes like the short rib entree ($28) at the Barrymore. I prefer the short rib dish at Public House, but the one here still has a mouthwatering, savoriness to it. Although it could have been larger and more tender.\n\nOn the other hand, the pan roasted Muscovy duck breast ($24) was a generous hunk of meat, cooked medium, with a slightly crispy skin. The creamy polenta and cherry-foie gras jus intensified the richness of the dish, making it easy for me to wipe the plate clean.\n\nWe split a side of the cream corn and lobster with bacon ($11). My wife liked it but I wasn't a huge fan. Their bread basket was filled with four or five varieties. The bacon roll was clearly my favorite.\n\nThe drinks were excellent and reasonably priced (at least by Strip standards). The Spring Buzz ($13, Hanger One Maine wild blueberry, Kubler absinthe ginger beer, fresh lemon, berry syrup) was good and strong. The Au Bon Climat pinot noir and Lyeth meritage were good accompaniments to our dishes. If you're looking for bottles, their list includes 50 under $50.\n\nThe service was solid and surprisingly we saw two or three other parties with kids. The staff didn't seem to mind and made us feel welcome. Although maybe the smaller dining area is where they stick all the people ballsy enough to bring their offspring?\n\nMinus the Groupon, the total for dinner was around $150. It may not be as good as many of the top Strip restaurants, but it is a good value in unique setting that's close enough (or far enough) to the Strip to attract both tourists and locals alike."

When I arrived they told me 10 minutes and as I waited with my party, the phone at the hostess desk rang un-answered constantly. This should have been a sign.\n\nOnce seated my boyfriend was unhappy about the booth, but it didn't bother me. Then it took at least 20 minutes for anyone to come over and take drinks. Another 20 for bread to arrive. Then the bottle of champagne came out that we ordered and we were told it had been chilling, we can feel the bottle if we would like, but we may want it a bit colder. I tasted it and it was room temperature.... so it had to sit for 20 minutes in ice. The sommelier however was amazing and made me a chair out of the cage on the bottle. Then after being there an hour we got to order.\n\nWe were pressured by the waiter to all get appetizers and entrees and that they didn't come with sides just garnishments so we needed that too. He seemed offended when not all of us wanted appetizers. It took 40 more minutes for the food to come. Once it did half of the party enjoyed their dinner, half did not enjoy it. The bread, octopus and Brussels sprouts were all fantastic, my salmon was good with the hollandaise. Both of the fish dinners came with sides, the steak did not. My boyfriend's steak was charred on the outside and tasted burned, but the inside was blue, not just rare, blue. He was bummed especially since he ordered it medium rare. They also brought me the wrong dinner at first, so I had to wait a bit longer for my dinner as well.\n\nI was so excited to go to The Barrymore and bring 4 friends. I've been talking about going for the last year and now I wished I had picked somewhere else for my birthday. It took 2 1/2 hours to eat dinner and it seemed their service was pushy when there and overall unattentive. They are only looking for you to spend as much as possible and don't care about your experience. Except for the sommelier, he was lovely."

The one thing I will say is that it's not directly on the strip, and it's slightly too far to walk (especially if you are all dressed up for the evening and don't want to get sweaty). But that said, it's only a five minute cab ride (or less) away, and is totally worth it. \n\nGreat food and drinks, and not too terribly expensive, you can get out of here for under $100 for two people if you really want. We ordered drinks to start, I got a bellini and the bf got the Barrymore (their version of an old fashioned) which was very smooth. We got the lobster mac and cheese for an appetizer, very yummy. Ordered sea bass and the prime steak special for entrees. The sea bass was good, but the steak was spectacular, cooked perfectly and very flavorful. And for dessert we got the warm chocolate cake, again probably some of the best I've ever had. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and actually recommended some of the items that ended up being our favorites. He even brought complimentary sparkling wine to have with our dessert. \n\nWould recommend this place to anyone, great for date night or special occasions. It is small and intimate, so they recommend making reservations."

We 1st went to the Barrymore on the recommendation of the bartender at LBS once he told us it was closing and promised to send down their recipes for the Pork & Mary and the Cucumber Mary. 1 has made it. \n\nOur 1st visit was after an especially trying day at CES. We had clients who wanted old Vegas ambiance but not the schelp to DTLV. Normally I don't take clients a first time before I'd tried it but I was brain damaged from the CES overload. \n\nWhat a GEM! Tucked away in a non-descript hotel, The Royal - it was like walking back in time. Cool, loungy vibe coupled with a variety of seating. It was chilly so we opted not to sit on the patio but on one of the comfortable couches just inside the bar. \n\nI mentioned to our waiter - who was quick to bring us menus and take our order that we'd been referred by LBS and did they have anything close to the Pork & Mary or the Cucumber Mary. A very quick chat with the bartender & wallah.. cucumber Marys all around. \n\nThe Drinks:  ample and during happy hour - only $5.00!  4 people 4 rounds - awesome! \n\nThe food:  We've been back many times since. Our recommendations would be the roasted artichoke; the wild boar & the crispy pork belly. Perfect accompaniment to soak up the cocktails. \n\nAmbiance: The 1st time I went looking out the huge windows I could almost imagine I was back home in NYC. Evening light on the high rises with the golden glow that is Vegas.  Once the weather was consistently above 60 we moved to the patio. Comfortable banquet seating with just the right touch of torches for light & heat. \n\nService:  I cannot say enough about this. We've been there 4 times since January. Each time it has been better. The 1st time we went during CES - the manager came over and bought us a round of drinks. Who does that anymore? The bartender gave us the recommendation for some of the newer additions (the wild boar) his latest cocktails - we are still bound to bloody marys & Block 16 newly opened locations."

Yes, the ambience is nice and the restaurant sports on some creative decor (there are movie reels in the ceilings!), but the food is just blah and the service is horrible. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I came here during brunch so you may get better mileage during dinner. We had three types of appetizers that were just flat-out unmemorable: The grilled artichokes, the soft-shell crab and the deviled eggs. The grilled artichokes weren't so bad, but the soft-shell crabs and deviled eggs lacked that \"umph\". The soft-shell crab needed more acidity to cut it's richness (no - the mandarin oranges simply did not cut it) and the caviar in the deviled egg were muddled. \n\nFor my main, I had the lobster benedict, which was god awful. The dish,  a layer of soggy toast, asparagus, and lobster served with potato hash, was drizzled in a hollandais sauce that was  too tangy for my taste. \n\nThe desserts could have also been better. I had the coconut panacota, and I've had many variants of this dish. I've always been fond of desserts with coconut cream as a base, and choosing these type of desserts have never failed me until now! The panacota was paired with fried granola-like coconut flakes that were just to sweet and overpowered the subtle coconut taste. To the chef at Barrymore, try adding hints of lemograss (ala Spring Chicago) and serving it with blood orange (ala NaHa) to bring out the subtle coconut-cream flavor.\n\nOne star for the food and inattentive server, plus another star for the clever interior design."

The vegetables were farm fresh as well. We sat pretty near the kitchen and she loved the smells coming from there too.\n\nThe decor is very cool and elegant, Las Vegas meets Hollywood, Rat Pack film noir, complete with gold film reels covering the ceiling. With period music to boot. The clientele looked very with it, no wife-beater tank tops & fanny packs here. The Royal Resort location that houses the Barrymore off the Strip looks empty and forgotten, but that's what they said about the South Beach, FL hotels in the 80s, so I expect the hipsters to show up and make it a cool place.\n\nThe only star deduction comes from the fact that the $30+ entrees are served on just garnish. All sides, such as vegetables, must be ordered separately at $10+, sending the meal into quite expensive territory. Our waiter pushed the sides on me, saying in effect I had to order one, and we noticed him aggressively pushing bottle upon bottle of wine, including $200 bottles, to the table nearby. When we didn't order alcohol (we don't drink), nor dessert (we had already eaten sweets that day & are health-conscious), we got the short shrift from the waiter.\n\nAll in all, an excellent meal, just make sure you manage your money and keep your head amidst the up-selling, like you do in the casino."

We were seated immediately and noticed there was a TV showing a football game.  A couple of minutes later, the TV was switched off and it turned into a mirror!!!  It was the coolest freaking thing I had ever seen.  The bar area is nice and spacious.  They have an outdoor patio with a really cool fire wall display.  Perfect place to snuggle up to your loved one.\n\nFood: Delicious.  The portions are tinier than what I imagined, but the food is so rich and yummy, that it works.  For an appetizer, we had a type of veal carpaccio-ish dish that was spot on.  Oh, and I can't forget about the bread.  One of the types in the basket has bacon in it!  And the crispy cracker one is peppery.  I had the seared ahi for an entree which is served with a creamy polenta.  My husband had the short rib which was soooo tender.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake, and the chef was on Top Chef: Desserts, so you know it was good.\n\nDrinks: They've got the handcrafted-putting-weird-stuff-like-marmalade-in-your-alcohol drinks going on here.

I'm used to dining within the various casinos at a variety of restaurants with top notch chefs and glitz and glamor, but this place was well off the strip in a hotel I had never heard of.\n\nExpecting a typical steakhouse, when I saw the menu I knew I had to try a number of the appetizers.  The seared foie gras was excellent and the fried calamari was fresh and not greasy at all.  Also, they brought out some bacon cherry infused bread that was extremely good as well.  Since I had eaten steak the night before, I ordered the steakburger, which was very reasonably priced.\n\nWhile it looked good on the menu (Gruyere cheese, bacon marmalade and some kind of tomato), I thought it would be like any other burger.  Oh my, how I was mistaken!  Similar to the experience of enjoying a great movie you had never seen previews for or heard anything about, I was immediately blown away after my first bite.  I'm very much a good burger lover, and this was by far the best all around burger I have ever had!  It had a soft sponge type bun that didn't get soggy, a very full and juicy patty that was ground sirloin, amazing cheese, and the best tomato that was somehow pureed and grilled?  All these flavors combined into a juicy treat that formed a completely unique flavor of burger.  Adding in their special steak sauce at the end was the kicker.  \n\nI am actually somewhat saddened as I write this review that I won't be able to have another one until my next trip to Vegas, however I will most likely be booking that very soon.  Kudos to a very friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable staff that made the experience all the better.  This place is my new favorite Vegas restaurant."

Also, certain wines and beers also heavily discounted.  All prepared by a friendly bartender (Sarah).  Well worth it!  There is even a small outside patio for drinks.  \n\nBoth dining rooms are comfy and inviting. We arrived at 5:30 PM without reservations and had no problem being seated in a huge booth. The food in the restaurant, while pricey, was great.  Everything from the bread basket to the side vegetables was delicious.  Steaks were tender and perfectly cooked.  The only caution is that they tend to over-salt the steaks, so on my next visit I will mention that to the server.\n\nSpeaking of the service, it was excellent.  Food was delivered quickly and the table was cleared in a timely manner.  Our server (Emily) was all smiles and very friendly.  In general, good service without a hint of stuffiness."

            "review": "THE BARRYMORE - A BIT OF OLD LAS VEGAS\nThe Barrymore restaurant doesn't do any formal advertising. They don't have to. The food, the ambiance, the sincere interest demonstrated by reservations, wait staff, manager, and chef alike, make your dining experience a warmly personal and gastronomically delightful event and together create a charismatic memory that is unforgettable.\nThe Barrymore is a little off the beaten path, located inside the Royal Resort at 99 Convention Center Drive,  North Las Vegas. Neither the geographical area nor the resort per se has any of the gaudy glitz or the excited roar of the Strip. But with a single step inside the doors of the restaurant, you feel the intrigue of LV's theatrical history and the luxury of its star-studded past come to life. \nDimly and tastefully lit, you are ushered past a cozily inviting and friendly bar area into the dining room itself.  There are six large curved booths, three on either side of the dining room, and four square tables down the center of the room, for a total of 40 or so patrons maximum at a time. Sink into the comfort of a cushiony booth seat and look up. The ceiling is a sea of large, empty, metal film reels that lie shoulder to shoulder and cover the expanse completely. Some of the walls look like they're papered with a richly flocked pattern, and on these walls are hung framed black and white pictures of famed Hollywood stars done in a manner reminiscent of Rorschach ink blots. The walls behind the booths feature side-by-side-by-side octagonal porthole-style mirrors. The atmosphere is romantic and intimate. The sounds of the likes of Sinatra provide a gentle and nostalgic backdrop. \nThe drink menu is large and varied, although there are not so many wines offered by the glass as some might wish to see, a fact that we noted while we were researching The Barrymore online from home prior to making reservations there through Open Table.  Although we are typically cab or merlot drinkers, we were attracted to an Italian Chianti that was offered both by the bottle AND by the glass.  Once at the restaurant, however, we couldn't find the Chianti on the single glass wine list at all, and asked our server about it. She went to great lengths to find the answer for us, and it finally turned out that the online menu hadn't been revised that season, although the in-store one had, and the by-the-glass feature for that particular wine had been deleted. The manager himself, Mr. Chad Jahn, came to our table to apologize and to let us know that the error in the online drink menu had already been corrected. Shortly after our main courses of deep sea scallops and halibut arrived, Chad and the chef, Francisco Campa, came again to the table to ask how we were enjoying our meals. \nBreaking here to describe our dinners. There was a small relish tray brought to the table, as well as a basket of breads.  The latter consisted of two pieces of parmesan flat bread, some epi (a dry, braided, unsweetened crusty bread with a soft center), and two sweet rolls. All were sampled and all were awesome! The scallop plate ($29) had three large sea scallops, some seasoned green beans that had been roasted, and risotto in squid ink. The veggies and risotto were a delight. The scallops were delicious although the seasoning on top was a bit too salty for my taste. The halibut plate ($27) consisted of a nice piece of fish, about 4-5\" long and 1.5 - 2\" thick, a block of potatoes au gratin, and green beans pesto. Both plates were artfully arranged and visually appetizing.\nThe service was impeccable. The concern of the manager and the chef relative to the quality of our dining experience was refreshing and I believe genuine.  The prices were very fair considering the uniqueness of the restaurant itself, the quality of the food, the personal service, and the fact that one will pay considerably more anywhere else on the Strip for a lesser but similar dinner experience. \nIn short, The Barrymore should be on YOUR list of \"must do's\" when in Las Vegas. It's a definite winner and that's a sure bet!"

Can I just say- what a little gem!!! This place is awesome. Nestled right off strip in the Royal Resort (kind of a cool boutique hotel, also), this restaurant is top quality and comparable to the high end strip restaurants. Starting at the valet, service was excellent and friendly. The restaurant is dark and retro, it was very quiet. The decor is beautiful. We were early for our reservation but were seated immediately and had the whole room to ourselves! Emily was our server and she was super friendly and prompt. The menu was amazing- our food was absolutely delicious! It was my fianc\u00e9's birthday and Emily brought us out complimentary little cookies- so sweet! We also told her we were thinking about having our rehearsal dinner here in April and she was so excited and provided us with info to get in touch with their group sales manager. Once getting back home, we set up our reservation to have our rehearsal dinner- the manager was incredibly responsive via email. This place is seriously one of the best restaurants I've been to in Vegas. It plays homage to the classic Old Vegas, Rat Pack days, and I just love it!"

It is dark, artfully decorated, intimate, and perfect for a date night. There is a gorgeous patio with fire pits and heat lamps, as well. This is not a large restaurant, so I would imagine that it gets rather busy on weekends, as we had a 7p reservation on a Wednesday night and still had a 10-15 minute wait.\n\nThe service was impeccable, our server was friendly, but not too casual, and offered great suggestions and displayed a great knowledge of the menu.\n\nThe food- amazing! From the bread basket, to the grilled octopus, to the steak, to the salmon, it was all beautifully presented, perfectly cooked, and delicious. The prices were also very fair based on the quality of the meal, and the portions were just right. And even though we didn't get dessert, the complementary macaroons were just the right sweet touch to end the meal.\n\nI will definitely be back- the Barrymore is top notch!"

But when I order it medium, and my friend orders medium rare, you'd expect to see at least a _little_ pink on one of the plates... still, maybe a 3.5 star burger.\n\nThe lobster deviled eggs were the highlight, a solid 4 stars (I'd have loved to have seen some chunks of lobster in them!) but the flavors were great.\n\nThe lower points included us having a reservation at 10:30am (yes, early lunch, but I had to get my friend to the airport right after and this place just got such amazing reviews, I thought it'd be a nice place for her last meal here). Now, I got the reservation on Opentable, but their own website says they open at 8am, yelp says they open at 8am, and opentable gave me a 10:30 reservation. We show up right on time, but they don't actually open til 11. They were apologetic, and were trying to get things going for us faster, but still, for a nice place in Vegas, I'm used to getting at least a little something for being inconvenienced like that --- an offer for a drink or an app for the table would have won them an extra star, but alas.\n\nAnd by the end of the meal, our drinks had been long empty as we were given the check.... and still no refills... There are only 9 tables in the place, a little more attentive service would have been nice, and might have bumped it up to 4 stars, too.\n\nI will probably go back - I didn't get to try the mac and cheese (!), but it won't be top of my list for impressing an out of town guest.  Decor is excellent though - nice ambiance if you can get a table."

In fact, I prefer old school Vegas, the local's Vegas, off-season Vegas...you get the idea. But if you're at a restaurant, all you're going to care about is the food. And nope...this restaurant was not worth the effort it took to get here.\n\nIn short, most of our entrees were overly salted. One rib-eye was undercooked, one filet was overcooked, one duck was chewy. When you're paying around $50 for a plate, it better be pretty effin good. Unfortunately, it was just okay. The service was great - at both the restaurant and the hotel. (Thanks Tyrel for trying to help me locate my phone!) But I would be hesitant to recommend this restaurant when there are so many other options around and much closer to the strip."

Upon entering they were instantly happy. It is an intimate space with class and an old school vibe. While they were reviewing the menu they were happy to see a nice offering without feeling like they were being gouged. Service from Luis and Karla was attentive and personable without being intrusive. My father in law is not a drinker and has extreme dietary restrictions, they went above and beyond for him. \n\nThe personal touches are what made the experience worth writing about. It means a lot when the GM, Kirk, was on the floor touching base with all the guests in the venue. Corey, the bartender, had me try one of the new cocktails that will be featured on the new cocktail menu. It was called the \"Golden Globe\". It was a play on the dark and stormy but it was fresh and alive. \n\nI find that when you go out there is always one person in the party that wishes they had ordered something else, but that was not the case at the Barrymore. I tip my hat to a venue that can pull that off. \n\nI am happy in a city that has adopted a culture of not caring about the guest that there are places like the Barrymore. You will be seeing a lot of me for a long time to come!!!!"

On previous trips I've had the ribeye, and my fiance has had the filet mignon (which I always, happily, get to finish). On this particular trip I tried the New York Strip, and I am glad I did. Not a super easy steak to cook, and if you do it wrong you can definitely end up with a piece of meat that's wrong in a lot of ways. \n\nThe Barrymore has nailed it. They know steaks. Best-kept secret in Las Vegas meat.\n\nAnd as I keep harping on in all my reviews, the steaks are GRASS-FED! Not only is this amazingly healthy compared to grain- or corn-fed steak, but the flavor is worlds apart. Grass-fed steaks are better in every conceivable way.

The steak was ordered to be cooked medium however when it came out it was medium rare. The coolest thing happened; the manager came out and explained what happened and he asked to take my plate to get me what I ordered; in 5 mins it was right out and was perfect. \nThe service and atmosphere in this place is to die for and I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas because it's not about the \"lights, camera, action\" but about being able to eat your food with good background music and a place that actually acts like they want you to be there. \n\nAwesome!!"

It has a masculine, sophisticated feel with a touch of Hollywood seen in the golden movie reels that hang from the ceilings, and the Rorschach-esque artwork of celebrities from a previous era. All of this is located in an unsuspecting off-Strip hotel.\n\nThe menu offers an array of appetizing starters and several entrees that are familiar (roasted chicken, duck, steak), yet have their own unique touches. Even though the Muscovy Duck caught my eye, I went the \"lighter\" route by ordering a salad and sharing two appetizers with my friend. \n\nHeirloom Tomato & Hearts of Palm: Basically, another take on the caprese salad with its sliced tomatoes, basil, and burrata cheese. Very good.\n\nPan Seared Foie Gras: By far, the best that I've tried in Vegas. The flavor of the caramelized fig complements the rich, fatty flavor of the foie gras. \n\nLobster Mac & Cheese: Rich, cheesy and delicious, but on the heavy side for being an appetizer. \n\nManjari Chocolate Cake: The single scoop of pistachio ice cream that accompanies this goes great with the chocolate and cherry custard. \n\nService was excellent and personable. My friend made reservations in advance and throughout the whole evening they referred to her by name. Our server did an amazing job taking care of us, even as the night became increasingly busy. The manager even stopped by each of the tables to see how everyone was doing.

We found this place on restaurant week and will definitely be regulars.  We had the lobster Mac and cheese, which tasted amazing and had a ridiculous amount of lobster. Next course was an perfectly cooked 8 oz filet with the creamiest potatoes and asparagus.  For dessert I had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and my wife had the chocolate cake (I don't like chocolate and I would order this next time). The portions were large and the taste was out of this world.  We choose the wine pairing, this was a 35$ add on for 4 amazing glasses of wine.   The entire experience was better than any restaurant week restaurant we have ever been to.  This includes high end casinos and steak houses.  This meal was at the 50$ price point and was way better than meals we had at the 80$ price point. The staff was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. If you have not been here go!!!!!  You get a high end steak house experience at the cost of a local family diner.  We will be back!!!!"

The waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines and the drinks. \nThe special app of the night was Frogs Legs, which I hadn't eaten in years. I ordered us up an order of those and the Lobster Deviled Eggs. The Deviled eggs were very rich with the truffle oil and caviar topping and had that touch of lobster flavor from the diced up pieces of meat in them, but didn't overpower the eggs. Awesome!!\nThe Frogs Legs came out and were fall off the bone tender and highly flavored. My buddy had never eaten them before and was a bit shy about trying them but did and loved them also. Killer app.\nWe were seated for dinner afterwards and ordered 3 more apps to share.....the veal loin with tuna sauce, the roasted artichoke, and the beef tartare..........all incredibly delicious!! Very impressive.\nI ordered the lamb rack medium rare, and my buddy ordered the special bone in cowboy ribeye medium. My rack was perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth tender. My buddy's steak was more towards Medium rare/rare, which to him was  a bit of a turn off. We sent it back and it still came out rarer than requested. Funny, as I recall seeing multiple complaints on websites about undercooked meat. \nIf it was me, I'd have eaten it but then again, that's my preferred way to eat a steak. I tried his and it was sublime.\nThe waiter was annoyed at the kitchen for his steak misstep, but was very attentive , knowledgeable, and nice.\nOverall, the atmosphere was great. Staying on the strip on a Saturday night in the Cosmopolitan was absolutely insane busy, and so were their restaurants. It was terrific to be able to have a meal where it you could actually have a conversation and not be at all rushed, in such a tranquil atmosphere. Their pricing is also a bargain when compared to the hotel restaurants also. \nGo there with confidence that you will have a memorable meal and mention to the waiter to make sure your steak needs to be medium, if you like it that way, or the chef will err to the underdone side.\nAwesome restaurant and atmosphere and food to die for made for a memorable evening."

Never came by once to say  \"how's your meal\"  or  \"would you like a second cocktail\".  We've wanted to come here for years, and now we can tick it off the \"to do\" list which is a shame as we take people to Vegas several times a year and go over and over again to places like Vic and Anthony's, Lotus, DuPars and a few others. This won't be on that list.\n\nWhen we were seated, it took a good time for anyone to come to the table, and eventually a very nice man came by who I am guessing was the Sommelier or bar manager came by to offer us drinks. After some time the waiter came by.  He seemed a little put off that we didn't order entrees (you know that fleeting moment where you read the expression on someone's face?), but rather, several appetizers. Maybe that's why he generally never came to our table again?  None the less, it was $140 worth of appetizers and drinks. \n\nWe had reservations, on a Saturday and showed up- the place was half-empty.  Maybe 4 tables out of the 10 were taken.  So the ignoring your table because you're so busy wasn't it.  \n\nOver-all, each of the dishes were just meh, okay.  Nothing was a standout and certainly this $140 dollar meal was worth more like at the most $40. \n\nThe bigger message is, the place seems tired. Service is always a good portion of the experience, and I don't know what's going on here, but they need to take a rest and re-group. The appetizers need a little work as well."

Upon entering the hotel it's in, it appeared as though the restaurant was closed. We almost turned around and left but the man working the front informed us otherwise. We walk in and get glared at by the worlds most unhospitable hostess and decide to sit in the lounge tables. Mind you, we're the only ones in this place. After being greeted by a server, we decide to sit in the dining room instead. Our server.... where to start. Classic jaded Las Vegas server. Explains all the specials to us and rehearses some spiel about Drew Barrymore. As I try to engage in the conversation he shifts his attention to more specials and walks away. We came with a party of 4 and ordered a bunch of apps, entrees and sides to share. However, because we ordered so much food we only got one steak. The server walks away after taking our order with a snappy comment \"OK, one steak to share, for all four of you.\" After getting our food, everything was ok but the lobster mac and cheese which I was MOST excited to try. Guess what, not one single piece of lobster in it. I told the manager when he checked on us and said \"oh that's weird, i'll take it off the check.\" I didn't care for it to be off the check, but expected they would send out a new one. Never did, and never bothered to take it off the check. We didn't end up saying anything, just paid our $350 check and left. I'm still confused where that money went. Definitely was not worth it."

Drinks consistent with other reviews. The manager stopped by our table and chatted for quite awhile - we learned the history of restaurant and features of menu. He seemed to honestly care about our experience - I inquired about the foie gras - he said it was good, but they were going to tweak it. It was ok - a bit gamey, sinewy, too much quince, etc. good thing they will work on it. Lobster Mac and cheese was dry and tasted like strong cheese - The mgr checked back and we gave him our feedback -  he insisted on exchanging the Mac and cheese - as it turned out the second was much better and creamy (tasted like totally different dish) although I wouldn't recommend it. We ordered the special entrees- lamb, cooked perfect - could have used a crust and lobster, good too. \n\nBUT - the specials were grossly over priced in comparison to the rest of the menu, by at least $25/ea. The waiter doesn't tell you the price, shame on us for not asking - so be aware! I don't mind spending on great food but this was good trying to be great and I don't like surprises - like when the waiter said \"don't worry, I didn't charge you $10 for the water\" WTF - this was still or tap water! Wine menu very interesting but grossly overpriced too. We are from No. CA with access to lots of great wines - we just couldn't get excited about the offering to value proposition.\n\nWe went to experience something more authentic and to get off the strip - left feeling unfulfilled and disappointed."

Highly recommend getting the scallop entree and the duck confit entree. Both entrees were cooked to perfection. This place is a hidden jewel. It's a small restaurant but its worth the trip. We came pretty late to the restaurant but they still took very good care of us. Most of the time if you go to a restaurant late, they will cook the food real quick and so the customers could eat and leave as soon as possible.

We got a great assortment of breads, my fave was the pretzel roll, which was to die for. I got the Chilean sea bass for $35, which was amazing. Some of my friends who ordered other meals weren't as satisfied. One friend got the chicken which she said wasn't nothing special and same for the curry dish. \n\nNow here's where I have my complaint. This place IS expensive so if coming here plan on spending quite a bit. All the drinks are pretty much $12 on up. My 1st was a pomegranate martini, very tasty and $15. I ordered a glass of pinot noir at dinner and when brought to me I thought he was giving me a taster. That's how little a pour it was. Probably about 4oz, definitely no more than that. And when I looked down the table at others who had already been sipping on theirs, it looked like they might have gotten an adequate pour, which is 6oz. I asked the manager and he said my glass was what they pour but I complained so they gave me about an ounce more. I figure if I'm paying for a $15 glass of wine I deserve as much. Also its funny there were 2 pinots on the menu. I only saw 1 which was $13 but they waiter didn't ask so he gave me the $15 one so when I got the bill I thought they charged me for my extra pour. Now what's also funny, one of my friends at other end of table got a 2nd glass of wine, he got a double pour, about 10oz!!. Hilarious! I want to just say, I recently went to the Wine bar at Tivoli where their wines were $14-16 per glass but at least gave a nice 8oz pour.\n\nI will say we had a huge party and the staff was very efficient, friendly and I appreciated that they separated all our bills."

From the very first interaction I was hooked on this place. Heather Caldwell was incredibly kind, quick to respond, and so so friendly. Talking to her on the phone was easy and the packages they have at the Barrymore are very easily customizable to what your needs are. They have decently priced prix fixe menus with relatively low F&B minimums. We were able to feed our 34 guests a really high end meal for a great price. Everyone kept talking about how great the food and service was. We loved our meal, and our cake which was custom made in house for us. I would definitely recommend this place as a post nuptials dinner reception site. The service from start to finish was fantastic. The inside of this place is romantic and intimate and plush. It's like the Rat Pack might be hanging out in the place! Very Old Hollywood/ Old Vegas feel to it with really luxurious decor. The film reels on the ceiling is another really nice touch. Just a super romantic venue and perfect for a wedding!

The interior is nice, old Vegas style and the booths in the main dining room are great.  The only downside is that because it's in Vegas, and despite the \"please dress classy\" code, the date with my wife was marred from the start with the ripped tank top + shorts gentleman seated right across from us.\n\nThe food....the foie gras was spectacular - very tasty.  The chopped salad was weak - the dressing had no flavor which made the iceberg+chick pea combo taste like water and sand.  The NY Strip was, well, a strip and its hard to screw that up though a bit salty. The sides were fair. My wife ordered the Short Rib.  It came cold.  As in room temperature cold.  The only thing was that the one they gave her had a lot of meat on it and when we sent it back, they replaced it with 1 that had almost no meat.\n\nWhen we called the manager over, he apologized but then went on to say that it was a \"naturally fatty cut\" and that \"5oz of meat was to be expected\" but having been a cook, I can tell you that there was no 5oz on this piece.\n\nThe manager offered to switch it out but the problem with that scenario is that in the attempt to save revenue, they forgot that the meal was already ruined and waiting for another plate on an already upset timeblock was not going to fix anything.  At that point, just offer a discount and end the evening.  But even after 2 discussions with the manager, there was no such offer.\n\nI am sure there were good plates but for the mediocrity of the food and more than that, the crappy service from the management (the waiter was fine), I just can't recommend it.\n\nAnd a small note to management - learn to wear suits that are cut the right length.

Chastity Bebe assisted me with the planning and she answered all 200 of my emails within a business day and with a pleasant tone. I felt from day one that she personally gave a damn about the success of my event, better yet my special day. \nChastity was consistent and even attended the event to make sure it was executed to perfect. \n\nThe Restaurant GM, Sergio G. and his crew treated my guests with the utmost respect and care. The service was really beyond my expectations. The bartenders executed our signature drinks with precision. Sergio made me feel like a princess. \n\nAMBIANCE: The restaurant is romantic and fun! The blue room, the gold room, the bar, the patio. it is such a special place. \n\nJust go and give the Barrymore a shot! Tell them Natalie sent you!!"

We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and Grilled Octopus for starters. They were both very good, but the octopus was definitely a surprise. Extremely tender and not at all chewy as I come to expect with octopus. For our entrees we ordered the Pan Seared Salmon and the Pan Roasted Duck. The sauces for both were delicious and the serving size was just right. For dessert we had the creme brulee and chocolate gelato. The creme brulee was one of the best I've ever had. Excellent presentation of each dish, it looked good and tasted even better.  The service was amazing and  we will definitely be back."

Unfortunately, bad service and below average food ensure I won't be returning for a fourth time. \n\nOur group received slow service every step of the way. Despite the restaurant being 3/4 empty, we had a long wait to be seated, receive menus, have our orders taken, receive our food and get the check. We had to ask for a drink menu and bread. We had long stretches when our server was nowhere in sight. \n\nI ordered the filet cooked medium. It was raw. Others in our group also received their food undercooked. \n\nI liked The Barrymore as a hidden gem away from the bustle of the Strip, but after this experience I won't return and will quit recommending it to others.\n\n\nUpdate: Management from The Barrymore contacted me as a result of this review in an effort to get more information and to make things right. I declined the offer for a comped meal, but the genuine concern from management is a good sign that they're trying to do the right thing."

We walked in and I instantly like the place just by the decor. It's like Mad Men meets stylish interior decorator....way cute place! The restaurant isn't too big itself probably 8 booths, 2 large tables and a smaller table. \n\nWe started off with the Lobster Deviled Eggs and Softshell Crab appetizer. The deviled eggs were good, but probably a lil too oily for my tastes. Softshell Crab appetizer was good, not my favorite but still good seeing as how softshell crab isn't my favorite. For dinner I ordered the surf and turf filet with 1/2 a lobster and my husband ordered the Cowboy ribeye. My filet was pretty tasty, BUT not as tasty as the Cowboy Ribeye that the husband got! Both pieces of meat were tender and flavorful. My lobster was a lil bit over cooked as it was a bit rubbery, but for 18.99 for half a lobster I think that's a bargain. Only thing is that you do have to crack the claw yourself and that got a bit messy. They should probably hand out wet naps just in case for the people like me that don't like to waste food. For dessert we ordered the coconut panna cotta (husband ordered it)....definitely not the best dessert, but I did like the mango and lil almond crispies or whatever it was on top.\n\nOverall, service was very attentive and food was good. For all that food plus a soft drink and a beer, it was about 200 bucks so be prepared to spend some money for the good stuff! I know we will be putting the Barrymore into the rotation. =)"

It was a bit last moment, and we wanted a classy looking place that could accomodate 8 people for dinner at a short notice. Most places of that nature were already booked until finally we found Barrymore, reviews looked good, and the location really is very close to the Strip. We made multiple phone calls there to assure the reservation and ask any relevant questions. The service we received before even ordering food was so ridiculously bad, I am not sure folks there realize just how easily a reputation of a restaurant could be ruined by a couple of bad reviews. Perhaps, it was just a really bad shift manager, so I don't want to necessarily criticize the whole establishment. But let me just mention the facts1)We had certain liquor preferences and asked them about a corkage fee. On the phone they said it would be $30, which would have been fine. When we came and asked them to open our bottle, they said they have no license to serve liquor (even though there was definitely wine on the menu and hard liquor at the bar), but it wasn't \"an issue $100 wouldn't fix\". 2) They were quite rude to my mother who asked about some special dietary accomodations for our elderly guests. As the manager was responding, he actually took a swig of vodka in front of her. 3) We decided to leave (having no back up plans and having the b-day ruined), the manager chased us out, cursed out my whole party (including the f*** word), and asked a bunch of well dressed respectable people to never come again (and this in front of all the other patrons). It was especially embarassing because all of us were from out of town, had no cars, and had to just stand out in the dark and cold on an iffy plaza trying to arrange rides. So, definitely think twice before making any special plans at this place until and unless the management changes."

It's the only place on earth I've never wanted to visit on my own accord and yet friends and family keep picking their birthday celebrations there!  Oh well, luckily the city of sin also has succulent temptations in the way of food.\n\nMy sister was hesitant to try it out as the location is a little off the beaten path, but considering we were staying at the Trump it worked out okay.  The luxe booths, dim lighting, and transparent wine wall definitely contrasts the fluorescent lights and white floors of the hotel entrance.  \n\nI was very pleased with the selection of cocktails available, offering handcrafted and interesting selections as opposed to the newest twist on a Cosmopolitan.  Thinking back on it, I am pretty sad that I didn't try the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  The waiter gave me some great guiding advice and I liked him so I went with it.  I ended up with Octopus with papas bravas and some sort of aioli.  Literally the most tender and velvety octopus I've ever eaten.  I was in absolute heaven with my Aperol spritzer.    \n\nAlthough my shining review might need to be tempered with the knowledge that I had spent the last three days hiking the Grand Canyon, I still feel that this is a solid and delicious restaurant."

We could of ordered another main entree but the options for the appetizer were so appealing!  The heirloom beet salad with goat cheese and the Maine chilled lobster salad were delicious!  I also had to get my foie gras fix since I'm from Cali and it was seared nicely and had almost a breakfast feeling since it came with candied walnuts and sweet potato pudding.  We ordered the lobster mac and cheese but that came with our main dish which was fine!  I ordered the short rib which was glazed nicely with a red wine sauce!  The lobster mac and cheese was good but didn't have too much lobster flavor in it.  This meal was super rich!  But it was our last night in Vegas and we went out with a bang!  There was another guy who worked there who knew a lot about wines and alcoholic beverages.  This guy offered us a shot of Amaro Ciociaro and told us the story behind this Italian liqueur... supposedly helps with indigestion after eating a rich meal like we just did!\n\nOverall I would totally recommend this restaurant to my friends... a place you can go off the strip but have a fabulous meal without paying the Las Vegas strip prices!"

You will definitely want to make a reservation to ensure that you get a table. The dining room is small and kind of dark. The weird wallpaper does nothing but darken the place up even more. The ceiling is really cool and I think with a lighter wallpaper it would really showcase the awesome ceiling. \n\nOur meal started with the bread basket and we were not disappointed. The bacon raison bread was really delicious and the warm baguette slices were also a great touch. The parmesan crisps were also good, I even added a few to my pasta. \n\nI started with the Roasted Heirloom Beets and was so happy I did. I love a good beet salad and they have a great beet salad. The goat cheese fritter was a really inventive touch. Everything on the plate worked well together and I tried to savor every bite. My husband started with the lobster mac and cheese. I really liked that it was creamy, but I didn't really think the lobster added anything to the dish. \n\nMy husband and I both chose specials for the night. I went with the pappardelle pasta with a pork belly ragu and escarole. The escarole added a nice bitter flavor and the pork ragu was very savory. The pasta was delicate and delicious. I was very happy with the dish and had enough to bring some home. My husband had a surf and turf special of a filet of bison and lobster tail. The bison was so tender and delicate, I really enjoyed the few bites I was able to steal.\n\nNo meal is complete without dessert, so we moved on to the creme brulee. The creme brulee was perfectly done and the spiced pears added such an amazing flavor, it really worked well. The oatmeal cookie ice cream didn't bring much to the dish, but it was still really yummy. I definitely want to eat all future creme brulee with spiced pears!\n\nWe were not disappointed with our meal and I would definitely head back to the Barrymore again...soon!"

At the very start of the evening you blew me away with your old-school-gone-chic-fun-and-funky vibe. Your taste in music is classic and exquisite - wooing me from the start with a soundtrack that includes Billie Holiday. From the plush velvet tuck and roll booths to the faux velvet flocked black and gold wallpaper you looked too cool for school, but your open and friendly attitude made even older folks like my husband and I totally feel welcomed. \n\nOur server, Israel, was FANTASTIC! Although he was pretty busy hopping from table to table, he took the time to talk to us about your history, the family that started the entire Block 16 restaurant group, recommend a bottle of wine from your sexy glass encased wine cellar and even call me by first name. Super attentive and always willing to enthusiastically rave about your food.  \n\nAfter having a grilled octopus epiphany at Estiatorio Milos, I've been searching out other restaurants in town that have their own version.  In fact, doing a Yelp! search on \"grilled octopus\" is what brought me to you in the first place. The tantilizing tentacles came beautifully mounded in the center of the plate with papas bravas, topped with celery leaf and bordered with dots of spicy tomato and chorizo oil. You delectable devil you! The octopus was of a thicker cut than Milos', which made it a bit difficult to cut through, but was surprisingly soft and non-rubbery. As with all your wonderful dishes, it was a sum of its parts for sure.\n\nNext up - your Roasted Black Cod with brandade fritter, creamed leeks and squid ink buerre. I don't know if I'm imagining things, but this seemed like you were subtly winking at me and flirting by showing off your sense of humor. Beautifully presented, each item on the plate was solid within itself - but eaten all together?  I definitely got a kind of deconstructed and elevated \"fish and chips\" vibe - mainly coming from the inclusion of the fritter. Oh Barrymore, you're so charming and witty.\n\nWe don't usually do dessert, but one glance at the menu we were once again seduced by your charms. Israel suggested the Creme Brulee with balsamic strawberries, basil lime sherbet and black pepper shortbread - which we went for.  Again, a sum of its parts - I wasn't sure how the basil-lime sherbet was going to work - but boy, does it ever. Acidic cool and redolent with basil up against the creamy sweetness of the brulee and the tanginess of strawberries - you've shown me how thrilling a terrific dessert can be. I'm ruined.\n\nI'm sure you get a lot of love letters - and I don't expect to enter into a monogamous relationship or anything - but this one night stand was one for the ages. Thanks Barrymore!"

Unfortunately for that evening, we were not notified that there would be a wedding that took over the entire dining room so we were seated in a little room off to the side of the bar.  Definitely a huge disappointment.\n\nService was also a very big let down.  Because our table was small, it did not have room for our wine bottles or water bottles.  They kept water in a chiller behind us and the wine in some hallway on one side of the room.  Water was filled slightly more often than the wine but towards the end when they got busy, we went thirsty.  Our wine glasses sat empty for long stretches.  Even when the snooty unhelpful manager dude would pass by, we'd still go thirsty.\n\nSo it appeared that they only had one server for that entire room which consisted of a party of 14, a couple two-tops and another 4 or so four-tops.  There were a couple bus boys bustling around but otherwise, after it got busier, we got ignored.\n\nThe food started out good (when it wasn't so busy).  We got the large seafood tower, king crab cocktail and lobster mac and cheese.  These items were pretty tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves...happy that we were kicking off in good fashion.\n\nUnfortunately, from there it was all downhill. Although our friends raved about their entrees (filet mignon rare and sea bass), hubby and I were not happy with ours.  I ordered the ribeye and hubby went with the NY strip.  After a bite of the steak, I thought something was off.  I put my finger on the steak and realized that it was barely warm.  Same for hubby's!  All our sides came and the sauteed mushrooms were cold.  Nothing else was really hot!!  Worse yet, our steaks were underseasoned and mine was so full of gristle I stopped eating it halfway through, feigning a full stomach.  Should we have paid double and gotten the \"Reserve\" steaks?!  At this point, I felt like they served us leftover wedding food.\n\nBy this time, I was worn out by how disappointing the evening had been.  It took us forever to get out of there...trying to find our server, get the check, get our cards run, etc. I didn't want to put up a fuss with our friends present but we could tell that towards the end, they too were also getting short on patience.\n\nFrankly, I get the feeling they are struggling.  When we arrived, the Royal Resort was deserted.  Their hip lobby lounge had nary a soul hanging out on a Saturday night and the bar was emptied out, shut down which was a stark contrast to how lively it was when we last visited.  The hotel's decline may be affecting this place's business.  \n\nNeedless to say, I think we've seen The Barrymore for the last time."

The young lady who answered the phone was very accommodating and set us up for dinner at 6:30 p.m.. Arrived early to have a pre-dinner cocktail and was met by a very friendly accommodating staff/bartender. From the bar it was on to the dining room which I found to have the ambiance/tone of cool \"old\" Las Vegas establishments of years past. Service attentive and not too pushy. Appetizers fabulous, foie gras, and tartare. The wine list good and reasonably priced. I was also impressed with the by the \"glass\" selection and it's  pricing, reasonable. On to the main fare. We were a party of three ladies and decided to share the bone in rib eye for \"two\". Our server was very accommodating with our \"share\" request. Once the main course arrived and tasting was done, I would say that the rib eye was one of the best steaks I have had in some time. The steak was huge with leftovers to take home after getting our fill at the table. Dessert of chocolate molten cake and we were set. All in all a great evening with an uber cool \"old\" Vegas feel. One note to management, your dining room music selection/ variety was some of the best I have heard in a restaurant. One comment being that the sound system seemed a little lacking the night we were there. One doesn't want dinner conversation overpowered by music, but thought I should give this observation a mention. Thank you The Barrymore, we will definitely be back. Cheers!"

            "review": "This place basically ruined my wedding. Let me tell you why.\n\nI originally called in 3 weeks ago to make reservations for my party of 14 after our wedding. I had submitted my credit card authorization, requested dessert from the pastry chef (which i had no response on, but that's another story), and had told all my guests/limo the plan for the evening. Then comes the week of my wedding, as i'm scrambling to complete last minute errands and extremely stressed out. I receive a call on Monday, for my reservation that Saturday. Whomever calls me left a message to verify my reservation. I thought this was odd to call 4 days early, but figured it had to do with our large party. I returned the call to confirm, and the associate asked me if i got her message a week ago (i checked my voicemails and incoming calls and there was nothing) saying that they had a private party actually book last week (after we had made our reservation) and that we would now be seated outside for our reservations. Mind you, when i originally scheduled this, i made them WELL aware this was my wedding, aka my party will be in dresses and the low is on average 35 degrees in Las Vegas. She reassured me there would be a heater though so it's all good. \n\nNeedless to say, i cancelled my reservation. I don't understand how The Barrymore would think it is legit to change someones reservation this way because someone else called in after me? i'm confused by this policy and extremely frustrated, as i am left to find a place to entertain my guests on my wedding night the week of my wedding. \n\nI find this place extremely disrespectful, and i will never attempt to give them my business again, although they clearly aren't too concerned with this notion."

All of the sides were done well, including one that I would almost NEVER get, the brussel sprouts - delicious. \n\nService was a solid B+. Our server was extremely formal in dress, demeanor, and verbiage, which I welcome - but maybe it was even a bit robotic for me. I love fine dining restaurants, but when I can't really connect to the server because the service feels forced, it becomes less desirable; and borderline uncomfortable.\n\nThe hotel that this restaurant is in was a serious turn off. It's an old, dusty, cheesy hotel. If you're coming here for a special occasion, I feel that some of the specialness may be lost when having to leave your car in the sad parking lot of the Royal Resort. Luckily, the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. Dark, comfortable, and romantic; with high booths and light background music for privacy. It really didn't match. I feel that the clientele of the hotel and the clientele of the restaurant would almost never overlap. Move this into the City Center, and that would be much more fitting.\n\nMeal was between $150 and $200 for two of us, so it was more Strip-level pricing. Not sure if that makes a lot of sense to me. It felt a little overpriced due to the okay service and less-than-ideal location. \n\n60/40 chance of me revisiting.. But the steak was amazing."

The ink blot paintings on the wall were a treat to look at and although small, with a good group of friends made it just perfect.\n\nService here was truly jaw dropping, the friendliness of the staff and the attention to detail they provided for you is something to not over look, they take very good care of you.\n\nOur food was delicious, everything was devoured and enjoyed bite by bite and I am excited to make my way back here very soon!"

For the most part, the food is good. Appetizers were tasty and cooked perfectly. Our party got the shrimp cocktail, lobster mac and cheese, rock shrimp and the grilled octopus. All really amazing. Where the restaurant was lacking was the service and the quality of the entrees. Our steaks and fish were overly seasoned with salt, it almost rendered it inedible. We would have said something or perhaps sent it back if it didn't take an hour for our entrees to come out after we had finished appetizers. I've been to this place twice, and both times had an issue with the timing of the entrees coming out at a reasonable time. It's a shame because for the price, you want to be able to enjoy eating all of your food, but waiting for that long you begin to get full and lose your appetite from the appetizers expanding in your stomach:( The service was ridiculous. We had about 4-5 servers and all seemed to be on different pages. You'd think with that much help, that things would run a bit smoother than it did. And when we asked how much longer our entrees would take (this is at 40 minutes after our appetizers were removed), we got shot back with an attitude. Not ok at all. I've worked in the service industry for seven years, and it was very hard to keep my blood from boiling over when we were treated this way, especially since our check total came out to more than $1000! Overall, our dinner took a little over 3 hours, when it should have been over in 2. By the end of it all, we were absolutely exhausted and instead of going out to enjoy the night, we all were just ready to go home. Any-who, with that being said, I sadly will not be returning to this establishment. First time shame on you, second time shame on me. It is truly a shame because it really is a beautiful restaurant."

Really great decor.

My wife and I really enjoyed talking to the General Manager last Saturday night.  He was VERY attentive and made sure everything was perfect.  He even took back a whole bottle of wine just after we ordered it because it wasn't to our satisfaction.  \n\nSmall and quaint.  Just very different and a great place for couples.

I went there to eat my favorite foie gras.  So I ordered a filet mignon with a size foie gras and beef bone marrow.  My husband also ordered the Chilean seabass.  The price is reasonable considering it is a high end restaurant in Vegas.  The filet was $43 plus $19 foie gras add on and $16 for two pieces of bone marrow with crusty bread.  The Chilean seabass was pretty soft and I thanked them for that!\n\nI didn't get the Yelp check-in free wine because my husband and I don't drink but that's a tip for those of you do.  We asked for steak sauce and the server brought us three kinds of sauce in little containers.  But the server didn't let us know that there was extra charge for $5.   I think I would appreciate if I was told there is extra charge because you never know how much it would be.  \n\nOverall the environment was okay and the food was decent.  The only thing I wish for is a bigger portion.  Especially that little piece of foie gras.  It was way too little.  I rather pay more to eat a bigger piece."

I felt like I was almost eating dinner at Hogwarts (lol) or on a fancy train because of the setting.  Very small, intimate dining room and nice setting.\n\nFood: The bread basket was amazing as they provided pretzel bread and a few other untraditional bread choices. Man, the pretzel bread/roll was amazing.  Caesar salad, scallops, pork belly, and lobster Mac n cheese appetizers were tasty (8.5 out of 10). The filet mignon was tasty once it was refired (will discuss below).  The lobster bisque was not as good as most I've had (7 out of 10). Everyone enjoyed their food and I was pleasantly full. The desserts were delicious and we sampled a few. \n\nService:\nThe waiter we had was awful. The waiter refused to bring my wife her diet soda, me some lemons for my club soda, forgot to bring a bottle of wine to the table as requested, and failed to do the above numerous times.  Both of the steaks that were ordered were cooked two levels beyond what the requested and had to be re-ordered. With a dining room so intimate, there is no reason why the waitstaff could not be extremely attentive to the needs of the tables. The waiter that we had was completely ill-equipped and did not deserve to work there.  After requesting the manager and voicing all of our issues, we were given some free desserts. We were still very upset about the service we got as the desserts did not nearly make up for the terrible waiter.\n\nThe Bill:\nThis place seems to charge more than they should for what they are. It also seemed like they were trying to be a couple notches above the level of class that they were as far as plating of the food and quality of service was considered. The prices were way too high for what we received. We had four people in our party, ordered a bottle of sparkling water, a bottle of cheaper wine, two martinis, one soda, five or six appetizers, and three entr\u00e9es. With a 10% tip, the bill came out to $380. \n\nThankfully, we were in great company and had a blast talking and joking with our friends. We will not be returning to the Barrymore."

My fianc\u00e9 had ordered the NY Strip, and I think our server had written it down wrong because she brought out a filet. When we let her know that it wasn't what we had ordered, she sincerely apologized. They brought out a shrimp cocktail appetizer in the meantime so that he could have something to eat while he waited a bit longer for his steak. The shrimp cocktail was so good! The shrimps were HUGE and fresh! \n\nTwo different managers came to our table to apologize for the mix up, which I found quite impressive. They brought us another round of drinks as well and when dessert time came, it was on the house. I was more than grateful and impressed at how they handled the situation. We weren't upset to begin with, but it definitely made all the difference in the world that they truly cared about our experience at the Barrymore.  \n\nOverall, the BEST dinner place we visited in Las Vegas. Every time we visit Vegas now, the Barrymore is a must! It's on my top list for favorite places. \n\nThey also have a great wine list. It's hard to decipher between ordering a cocktail or a bottle of wine since both options looked great! \n\nThank you for your outstanding service, your amazing food, and just a wonderful experience on our last night. We will most definitely be returning every time we're in town."

The problem is, many of the restaurants are jammed into smoky casinos, overpriced, and often focus on the show more than the food.  Sure...go to Switch once and watch in awe as the walls change and the roof rotates before your eyes.  It will be entertaining, and take your mind off the fact that you are about to get a $400 bill.  Everyone should experience it at least once. No pain no gain.\n\nFor those of you who consider a night \"off the strip\" somewhat of a victory however, I strongly  recommend that you give The Barrymore a try.  It does not have flashy dancers, crazy lasers, moving walls, ice sculptures, or celebrity chefs.  What it does have however, is old Vegas charm and...oh yeah...excellent food.  \n\nThe ambiance is more Lionel Barrymore than Drew Barrymore in almost every respect.  The dining room is warm and cozy with plush booths and a classy 40's-style movie motif.  One truly feels as if they might just look in the booth next to them and catch a glimpse of Bogey or Grant sipping on a cosmopolitan with a lady friend.  \n\nThe staff is great as well.  From the time we walked in and sat down, we received flawless service.  Our head waiter was dressed in a white dinner jacket and looked as if he could have just finished serving Lionel himself.  He was fully familiar with the dinner menu, bar specialties, and did not hesitate to offer his opinion on wine choices.   The evening manager also stopped by our table, introduced himself, and asked about our experience. \n\nWe dined on NY Strip steak, braised short ribs, and a wonderful risotto. Each dish was well executed, top quality, and very enjoyable. The highlight was a wonderful roasted artichoke, which still haunts my taste buds two weeks later. \n\nSo, if you are in Vegas looking for a flashy trendy restaurant named after some celebrity on the Food Network, you may be happier on the strip eating a $35 shrimp cocktail with the din of slot machines in the background.  If however, you are looking for a classy, elegant, dining experience with a real \"old Vegas\" feel.  Give The Barrymore a try.  The difference is black and white!"

We had a group of 18 and every single one of our guests loved the restaurant, the food, the staff and the environment.  We worked closely with Chastity to book the reservation and make our menu choices and she was amazing! She was so helpful and made the evening run smoothly.  We loved The Barrymore, our night was perfect! Absolutely perfect!!!!"

            "review": "Had dinner at Barrymore on my birthday.  Bottom line, food was just ok.  We ordered lobster mac & cheese it was watery and bland, foie gras is served like seared  whole chicken liver with sweet fruit and toasted almonds, it was just ok.  I ordered rib eye steak, it does not come with anything but plain steak, so my rib eye steak with veggie and bits of crab and steak sauce cost $75.00. The steaks was just ok.  My husband had the duck, the duck was just ok, it was a bit dry. My total bill with tip is $270.00 with 2 cup of coffee. Oh they gave me complementary cheese cake for my birthday with a candle."

I had no idea where or what the Royal Resort was and I was a little worried with I first pulled into the parking lot. When I walked into the lobby I felt like I had just found the best kept secret in Vegas. I LOVE the decor. So fun! It is my new favorite dinner spot. I can't wait to go back."

I have been to Del Friscos, STK, Ruth Chris and Mortons in town and the Barrymore is as good or better,  and when comparing price Barrymore wins."

            "review": "Had dinner here last night as I've been wanting to try this place out on my past few Vegas trips. Interior was definitely swanky, perfect for a date night. Restaurant was hidden just off the strip in a random hotel. \n\nOn to the food... Appetizers were on the small side. Foie gras was tiny but tasty. I got the aged bone in filet which was awesome. My main complaint is that I felt a bit cheated. Waiter presented the filet as their special of the night but didn't disclose that they would charge you for all of the toppings.  By the time I got the bill I was surprised that I paid 85 dollars for a steak. 65 for the steak 17 for a topping and 3 dollars for some sauce on the steak. I don't mind paying for a good piece of steak but didn't appreciate the dishonesty. Don't get dooped on the special like me! \n\nThree star but I rated it two too offset all the false reviews."

At first I thought  we were lost or the restaurant had moved.  The Barrymore is located inside the Royal Resort which is a little off the main strip.  Upon walking into the hotel there was no one in sight other than one person behind the service desk that pointed us towards the direction of the restaurant.  Once we walked through the somewhat hidden door it was like we were taken back to a the 1940's when mobsters ruled Vegas.\n\nOur server Luis was great and provided us with good recommendations.  We started off with Lobster mac & cheese.  They were are very generous with the lobster meat. My husband ordered the Bone-in Ribeye while I had their Chilean Sea bass and we ordered the Cream Corn Lobster and Roasted Cauliflower as our sides.  Ok, so I cannot stop raving about the amazing Chilean Sea bass.  It was melt-in-your-mouth spectacular and the simplicity of how it was prepared just let the flavor of the fish shine through.  I am a Cream Corn junkie and their Cream Corn Lobster did not disappoint at all.  We both polished off every dish we ordered.  For dessert we ordered their Guava Cheesecake which was the best ending to an unforgettable meal.  Then to end the night Luis brought us four of the cutest mini macaroons.  \n\nI would definitely dine at The Barrymore again when we are in Vegas."

I had better and I dont think its USDA prime.  I believe its USDA choice.  It was overcooked and I did let the waiters know and I was offered a replacement.  GIven I was with a party, I didnt want to hold up everyone so i ate it and they gave me a very small cheesecake as a replacement.\n\nThe steak itself (besides the overcooked part) was alright.  Nothing out of the ball park.  for $65 for 2 ppl servings (I shared with a friend), I expected a little bit more.  More like USDA Prime meat quality.  \n\nThey steak sauce is AMAZING! You should get the hordnaise sauce, im not spelling it right.  They have their Barrymore sauce too.\n\nFriend had the VEGGIE CURRY.  Dont order, its blend and not tasty.\n\nOther friend ordered New York steak i believe, its the other one.  Its alright too.\n\nBUT,\n\nthey have AWESOME service! Totally a place to bring a date! Ambiance is awesome, small and cozy.  Waiter is attentive.  They CLEAN your table after you eat and take plates right away.  Take bread crumbs away and very attentive.  \n\nGiven the price, service and quality, I feel that 4 stars is what this restauant gets.  COme here for a good time, but not awesome food!"

The cesar salad and lobster bisque where yummyyy, and also the complimentary bread, but the short ribs had to much fat and where a little burnt. I  Was not to crazy about the drinks either. So if you have extra cash give it a try and I hope your experience is much better than mine."

I really wanted to like the place.\nI made a special request for a nicer table as we were celebrating my parents' wedding anniversary - The restaurant called a week before saying they made special arrangements and got us a nice table on the patio. Great! \nWell it turned out that the \"special arrangement\" was to accomodate a big group that took over the whole room on the night of our reservation. So nothing to do with my request, they just fooled us. \nThe young lady who placed us was obnoxious and unpleasant. On the other hand, our waitress was really nice and helpful. \nI am putting 2 stars as the steaks we got (NY strip and T-bone) were very very good. The 35$ foie gras burger was a total disaster. \nDefinitely not worth the 25$ ride from the strip and freezing on the patio most of the time."
