I do have to agree with other yelpers that the price has gone up here. As for the service, I've learned to never expect great service at asian restaurants. Lol."

            "review": "One of the only Cantonese main stream chinese deli restaurants in town. It has the name brand of a large chinese restuarant but being Chinese American myself, this place sucks horse balls in the service dept which will distract from any food they serve up.  I have a saying of places do one thing good, be consistently bad.  I can depend on this place to be poor service but home-cook food, even if it's poor, it's better than bad American burgers, hotdogs, bacon this or maple this."

            "review": "Here's the breakdown...\n\nFood:\nWe ordered Mapo Tofu, Orange Chicken, Ong Choy with Garlic, Roast Duck, and a Seafood Hotpot. What saved this review from being only 1 star is the roast duck, tbh, which makes sense because BBQ is their specialty. However, it was the only dish that was even remotely tasty. Mapo Tofu had no flavor, tasted like thick, bland soup. Seafood Hot Pot wasn't too awful but still plain. Ong Choy also lacked flavor even though there was garlic in it, might as well have been without because you literally couldn't taste it. Honestly, don't even get me started about the Orange Chicken. I ordered it as the \"safe\" entree as in how could anyone mess up orange chicken?! But when it came out, it looked nothing like orange chicken and didn't taste anything like it, it was chicken bits drenched in a pool of a dark brownish almost black sauce that made me think it was sweet and sour, (emphasis on the sour), nothing like orange chicken that you get from anywhere else! \n\nService:\nServers are inattentive and kind of just disappear after handing you your food.\n\nAlso, a cricket was hopping around on the floor.. Yikes."

It took a while to get someone's attention before they finally came with the menus. Their service only got worse...\nWe ordered the BBQ pork, Chinese broccoli, and a seafood hotpot. Everything was just okay, nothing spectacular. About 1/4 of the BBQ pork slices had more fat than meat. The Chinese broccoli is just flavored with garlic and vegetable oil. The seafood in the hotpot wasn't the most fresh. My brother found a short strand of hair on his fish from the seafood hotpot, and when we showed it to waiter, he tried to deny that it was hair... if it wasn't hair, what else would it be? He took it back, and we decided to just cancel that plate order. I never really expected Chinese restaurants to be extremely clean, but denying the blatant appearance of a hair in the food was rather ridiculous."

Oops!  Think again!!!  Sure the name sounds familiar and you would expect semi decent food since most Sam Woo's only take cash.  Boy am I wrong on this gamble.  Food lacks the flavor.  All you can taste is the saltiness of the food.  Prices are much more expensive than you can get from real Sam Woo's in the SG Valley.  Let's just say anywhere from 30-40% more and the portions are like almost 30-40% less.  There is an upcharge of $1 for rice.  Infants and toddlers are not exempt.  Most places are exempt or even kids under 4 eat free.  Guess this Sam Woo figure that a 2 year old and a 4 year old will eat lots of their crappy rice since their entrees have no flavor.  First time going here and will be last time.  The panda express at the Venetian tastes 10X better and costs 3X less.  OMG!  How can that be???..."

            "review": "Somehow a lot of people kept recommending us this place (might they get paid to do that?). Ordered shrimp fried rice and another one with shrimp and scallops. The first one had miniature, ridiculous looking shrimp (probably imitation ones) while the second one had a few minced scallops and no shrimp at all. We told the waiter who took the dish back to the kitchen only to bring same dish back a minute later. He said that the cooks told him that the shrimp were chopped very little but were there. Of course you could not even smell the shrimp nor see them. Why would they use shrimp in one dish and none in the other is a mystery. all I know is that they will never see us again and we suggest you to do the same. The waiter also said that their food is authentic Cantonese.\nPS: We eat shrimp fried rice at Cantonese places all the time so we know how it supposed to look."

First off this place is dirty as hell, the food was horrible, maybe because i have been spoiled by the best Chinese food the San Gabriel valley has to offer. I ordered the duck noodle soup and the soup did not taste good at all and to top it off it was really expensive. bill came out to 50$ for 4 people which is only about 30$ when your eatting in California. \n\nDon't waste your time here........... it is better to drive 4 hours back to California and eat at the SAM woo there."

I ordered salt and pepper fish and the fish was not hot, the salt and pepper pork chops had about 5 pieces on the plate, and the sweet and sour fish had minimal sauce. On top of the food not tasting good, I don't know how 3 sides, rice, and hot tea turned into an $80 bill. FYI a dish in the San Gabriel Valley is under $10 a dish for lunch and under $15 for dinner for simple Chinese food- and, it tastes so much more satisfying that this LV Sam Woo. I mean, I'm glad I tried it so I know never to go back. I would recommend going to a buffet to get Chinese food instead.."

'Cash Only' is a bit of a difference for me for my love of the debit card but I don't blame them, they're just being smart.  The service isn't one of 'Hey how ya doing, hows your parents, how's your dog, blah blah' and sometimes I really don't want that.  I just want to order and eat my food, cuz guess what, I'm hungry!  They're quick and it tastes phenomenal to me.  Until I read other reviews, I didn't even know there were more than one, and if like some say, this isn't the best of them, I'm in for a treat when I travel!  I like them a lot. They're nice people and they always have my take-out ready and hot when I come to pick it up!"

And so were some of my girlfriend's friends that happened to be in Vegas the same weekend we were in Vegas.  So like any good motley crew of Chinese people, we decided that we would go try some Chinese food in Vegas.  \n\nSam Woo is a great chain found around Southern California, so know the  food well.  However, instead of doing the traditional family style like good Chinese people would, we ordered individual plates of noodles and such.\n\nOne dish we got was zazang (black bean) noodles.  (See my previous review of Zazang Noodles in SF for a quick history of the noodle).  However, these people here serve zazang noodles HONG KONG style! WTF man!? Who DOES that??\n\nApparently the way to know if it's HK style is in the Chinese name.  HK people will call it Zazang Lo Mien, instead of the normal Zazang Mien.  Bunch of wierdos.  Girlfriend included, who is Cantonese and apparently likes the HK style. WTF woman?!  That's like blasphemy, since my familial roots (from my dad's side) is from San Tung, and we happen to be the ORIGINATORS of zazang noodles.  I never even knew that our very own Chinese brethren would bastardize my beloved noodles so much that I wouldn't even recognize them.  Even the Korean copycats actually copy the recipe pretty well.\n\nOther than that dish, the noodles were good.  And since the gf liked the HK interpretation of San Tung's great noodle dish, I won't dock stars for that.\n\nFour stars cuz the food is good.  But I'd also like to check out some of the other smaller restaurants in the plaza."

They forgot to bring my daughters food and she considered herself lucky.\nThe cups they poured the soda in smelled and tasted of dirty dish water but even after they rush you to order, they don't come to check on you at all until you chase them down. Then they say they will fix it then don't come back. \n\nI ended up being overcharged for what we got and still charged for the food we didn't get. Then on top of it all, they wrote in a mandatory tip that was was waaaaaaaaaay to much for what it should have been without even noting that it was a tip. Snuck it in as an additional charge. I ended up paying almost $100 for what should only have been a $68.00 tab (including the food that we didn't get).\n\nThe Google reviews on this place is now 2.2\nI wish I would have seen that first."

In LA, there might be variations that have shredded lettuce cooked with it and maybe that would have made this dish better.\n\nThe fish filet with veggie dish was average, nothing special. There was definitely more fish than veggies. \n\nThe beef with green onion dish was average as well. We were joking that this dish might taste good as a sandwich later on. \n\nThe pan fried chow fun was decent, but was oily like it normally should be for a dry noodle dish. \n\nSam Woo is know for their chopped meats (char siu, duck, chicken, cuttlefish, etc).

Example: the BBQ Combination Plate which had the BBQ Pork, Roast Duck and Chicken.  We were excited to order it but when we received it what a huge let down. \n\nThe serving size was pretty small and for the price (I believe it was $16.99) you'd expect it to be much larger. As far as the actual taste.....Hell, I've had better Chinese BBQ at the 99 Ranch in Chino Hills here in Cali.\n\nAlso, it had to have the filthiest bathroom that I've seen in awhile which really made wonder about the cleanliness of the place overall. \n\nOverall an underwhelming experience I'd say don't waste your time here."

            "review": "Sam Woo is practically a household name in Southern California, much like Panda Express would be in most cities.  There are dozens of them all over Southern California, from Monterey Park to Orange County.  I used to go to the one in Irvine quite often, and loved that they had \"on-demand\" Peking Duck.  Most Chinese restaurants make you order it 24 hours ahead of time, but here you can get it whenever you want.  Some of the Sam Woo's are BBQ, some are seafood, but all of them serve traditional Hong Kong style Chinese food.  \n\nThe Sam Woo in Las Vegas is a BBQ restaurant, which means they have the Peking Duck on-demand.  This is my favorite part about this Sam Woo. They also have a lot of other BBQ items, such as BBQ spare rib and Chickens.  These can be either bought at the sit-down restaurant, or at the counter at the front of the restaurant.  \n\nThe restaurant is always pretty busy, but they handle the crowd well, and always have room for new tables.  I really enjoy their Hong Kong style crispy noodles, and their Honey Walnut Shrimp.  I also like the Pork Chop with Salt & Pepper.  \n\nThe reason I give Sam Woo's in Las Vegas a 3-star review is because it does not live up to the hype of the southern California restaurants.  I have found that the one out here in Las Vegas is hit or miss, having had very mediocre food on several occasions, while also having the typical great Sam Woo cuisine on severl other occasions.  This is what left me at 3 stars.  If they were consistent, it would be a 4-5 star, but until I consistently get the Sam Woo quality, they will never earn the other stars.  \n\nThis being said, I would suggest Sam Woo for anyone looking for great Peking Duck or Chinese BBQ.  There are not many other places in town that do it as well as them."

            "review": "Folks, consider this review a friendly warning. I gave SAM WOO one star, but I would have given it half star if I could.  My wife and I had eaten at this place many times before when we visited Las Vegas in the past.  Face it, when you had several buffets, steaks and pizzas. you would really crave for a bowl of hot wonton noodle soup topped with roast duck on a cold night.  That's exactly what we ordered.  The food was decent before. This time, it had left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFor my story, first, let me set the scene so that you get the picture. We arrived Vegas on 24th.  After a few buffets and burgers. we wanted some Chinese food, so we decided to go to SAM WOO.  When we walked in, the place was completely mobbed and many large parties for 5 and up were waiting. Customers with waiting numbers were literally standing in front of the table where sat down customers were still eating. So it didn't take long  for a table for  2.  We were seated about 20 minutes later. We were given a small table very close to the aisle. The hostess slapped the menu on the table and since we knew exactly what we wanted, we waved at the waiter to order. He came but the whole time during my order, he never had eye contact with me. He came back minutes later with a pot of lukewarm tea and put down 2 tea cups which his had his thumb inside. \n\nThe tea tasted like it was served to the previous customer. It was barely warm. So we asked him for 2 glasses of iced water.  The wonton noodle soup and the chow-fun came after about 20 minutes. The soup was terrible. it was not hot and the wontons tasted like old chopped pork wrapped in soggy wonton skin with no shrimps them. It didn'ttaste like traditional wontons. After 30 years in business, this is how SAM WOO makes the wonton! And the noodle was soggy ( probably it sat in the soup too long. At this point, I thought a cup of Roman Noodle sounded pretty good, Chow Fun was ok though. So my appetite was somewhat ruined. We wanted to get out of the restaurant so bad as we were not happy with the food nor the service.  \n\nI waved at the waiter for the check. He gave me a bill for $24 but along with it, there was a white slip of paper with $27.60 written on it. I knew the 2 items should be about $20 before tax. I waved down the waiter and questioned him about the total. He had the gall to tell me, because of the holidays, there is a $ 1.00 per head tea charge, with tax it is 24. The 15% tip calculated after tax being added was mandatory. I said I didn't asked for the tea (which was cold), and if  tea charge is the new holiday policy, he should inform the customers before serving the tea. Anyway, I didn't want to hash it out with the waiter, so I left the money on the table for the check amount plus tax and 10% as his service. And I told the table next to me which was a family of 6 ordering many dishes about their sneaky practice. I advised them be watchful of the bill. I did notice a couple of big parties leaving cash tips on the table on top of the snuck-in tip on the bill without realizing the tips were already included on the bill. A large party could easily run up to a $100 - $120 even for noodles and soup. If the waiter sneaks in a 15% tip on a $100 bill, that is $15 dollars for service on the bill. If customers didn't look at the bill carefully and tip him again. That's shady practice! I hope the restaurant's management is reading this so that they can change their way of doing business. I truly believe the waiters would not dare to carry out this practice without the consent of the management. I used to work in the hospitality industry. There is no such thing as mandatory tip. Gratuity is a reward for good service rendered.  If an establishment forces the gratuity on the customers when the service is sub-par. the sneaking in the tip is bordering line committing a consumer fraud without prior information given to the customers. Every charge should be clearly listed on the check and additional special charges must be informed to the customers. When we make a reservation for a party more than 5 people, some restaurant will inform the customers there will be a 15% ( sometimes 20%) service charge on the bill. SAM WOO did not inform the customers and took advantage of the holidays and gambling on people feeling hesitant to make a fuzz.  I was about to ask to talk to the manager, but second thought, it was Christmas and the placed was crowded with people. So I did the next best thing, get out of there leaving what I believed the correct amount was plus 10% which is more than what he deserved.  \n\nI will never go back again. I believe a restaurant has to try hard to gain the customers' business and trust. As a customer, would you get yourself upset by eating in a place serving low quality food  and service was so lousy that you had to spend an hour writing and bitching about it!  Folks, stay away. If you do decide to eat there, watch for any discrepancy on the bill, the waiters are sneaky."

The food was the best and the service was so fast.  And guess what, we even met some folks from Los Angeles eating there before hitting the freeways back home.\n\nPrice, you can't complain specially if you win some money from the casino like my wife did. But seriously, it's the best money can buy in Vegas (if you feel like Chinese). Be prepared to wait in line a little bit. The place is pack always."

I've eaten here several times before and the food is consistently good.\n\nThe prices are higher then So. CA. but what do you expect? it's still  reasonable compared to the hotel restaurants and it's authentic. \n\nI tried the the combination BBQ pork, soy sauce chicken and roasted duck over steam rice. The meats were all tasty but the chicken was the best cus it was so fresh and tender. I really enjoy the juice they pour over your steam rice- wow, what flavor. \n\nI don't eat this type of food very often cus it's probably not the healthiest food but I'll treat myself every so often. \n\nThe biggest turn off here is that they could keep it cleaner and I dislike the fact that it's cash only."

This place is CRAP.\n\nIt's located in Chinatown about 10 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. My family and I entered and waited to be seated. We waited for about 5 minutes. The joint was pretty empty except for two tables. We really shouldn't be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand, but the hostess was no where to be found. Weird...\n\nAnyways, we were seated and were immediately asked in Mandarin what we wanted. My mom asked them to speak in English and the waitress said, \"What do you want?\". Rude much. We ordered and our food came 10 minutes later.\n\nWhat we found most surprising? Charging for rice. We're Chinese and we frequent Chinese restaurants a lot and it's always complimentary rice whenever you order a dish. We ordered roast duck, soup, beef and broccoli, and the beef chow fun. We asked for rice and they gave us two small bowls and there's five grown adults here. I see other tables had the large red containers of rice while we didn't. \n\nWhen we got the check, they added 18% to 20% gratuity even though we were not a table of six. On their menu, it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more. We didn't want to tip at all, but they already included it. \n\nDon't dine here unless you want to be mistreated. There are numerous plazas and restaurants (pho/Vietnamese, Japanese, etc) surrounding this crappy place.  The service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attention. Also, PLEASE speak Chinese to them if you MUST dine here. My mother made the mistake of NOT speaking Chinese which I think made them believe we weren't Chinese and thus, gave us bad service."

We walked in, and immediately saw the \"Cash Only\" sign.  Luckily, we had enough cash to cover our charges for 4 people.  Once seated, we placed our orders, and were struck by how expensive everything was, especially for an establishment that is cash only.  The meal itself, was adequate.  We ordered a 3 bbq meat combo (Approx. $14) and I was expecting to see 3 dishes filled with 3 separate meats.  But, instead we were served a small plate with thinly sliced, smallish pieces of meat.  We also had wintermelon soup, which hit the spot to warm us up on that chilly night.  We shared some snow pea tips and braised tofu as well, which were OK.  \n\nAt the end of the meal we received our check, and did a double take when we saw that they added in tip automatically for our party of 4.  While we were somewhat annoyed that they had already added tip for a party that I wouldn't consider large, we were also amused that their additional tip was only 10%.  I guess they don't think much of their own service if they only give out 10% to the automatic tips!"

But eating it was a disappointment because the nice piece of red BBQ pork was just food coloring and nothing else. We were fooled by the looks of the item. There was no taste to it, totally bland. Only color.... \n\nThe chicken was over marinated by salt. The meat was rough. There was no possible way for my family to eat it because it was too salty. I know my mom would hate me if I threw the chicken out, so I suggested maybe we can make porridge out of it? I don't think the chicken porridge would taste any good either. But it's in the fridge. Maybe I'll throw it out tomorrow without letting her know? \n\nLastly, we had the roast duck. It actually wasn't bad. They had the duck right....  But hours later, I felt very thirsty, hinting that there was a lot of msg. It was weird cuz I haven't had msg over shock in a long time. \n\nI'm not going back here again.

From here on everything just went downhill. The guy who took our order was straight up rude. I asked if the steamed chicken could be made spicy due to a misinterpretation on my part of the menu. He literally could've just said \"sorry, we don't cook it that way\" but instead he gave me a dirty look and belittled me for even asking. I know that at more traditional Asian restaurants the bar is low for customer service but this was just on another level. Then he began to walk away before we even finished taking our order!\n\nWe literally asked for waters 3 times only to either forgotten or ignored. My mom eventually had to get up and get the cups and water pitcher herself from the kitchen because no one was even looking at us when we were trying to get their attention. I rarely write reviews on Yelp, but the way they treated me just left me beyond annoyed.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best. Everything was bland, we had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to even get some taste. So save your time and money and hit up literally ANYWHERE else because it will be better than this shithole."

It was one of the first 3 off-strip restaurants that I tried on Spring Mountain.\n\nUnfortunately my expectation for quality Chinese food at a reasonable price was quickly shattered by the huge mound of rice and miniscule amount of chicken and vegetables on the plate and the tourist trap prices being charged.  The flavor was okay, but trying to justify the price tag by shoveling extra extra rice is not the answer.  And I recall thinking WTH!  Did this restaurant steal the name of a well-known and much loved restaurant from California???\n\n2.5 years later, I am still not sure if the restaurant is operated by the same family or is part of the same franchise, but I do know that I didn't want to go back to this crappy Sam Woo ever again, and have been true to my word.\n\nAnd to those reviewers that think real Chinese restaurants do not or should not be bother with offer good service along with good food and still rate this poor imitation of a restaurant a 5 star, I think you should qualify your reviews with disclaimers that the reviews and ratings are for food only.\n\nAnd if I want to pay Casino Chinese restaurant prices for at least mediocre food, why do I have to leave the Strip?  Plus, I dare say that a lot of the Chinese restaurants in the high end casinos offer better food than the ones you can get here."

We should have turned the other way when we saw the filthy walls behind the BBQ butcher area but the menu sounded good and figured the portions would be huge.  We were sat and ordered the BBQ duck/pork combination and a plate of sweet and sour chicken. The food came out almost too soon and in super tiny portions (I'm suspicious they gave us the leftovers of someone else's order). The pork was dry and no better than the usual stuff you get on the side at every chinese restaurant. The duck was the most depressing part of the meal: almost all bone and skin on a tiny plate. The chicken wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. All of it was mediocre at best. My boyfriend ate most of it because he was starving but I just nibbled at the food. We will not be coming back here.\n\nAfter being totally disappointed and wanting to get out of there as quickly as possible we looked at the bill and they had charged us for the rice that came with our meal without even asking us if we wanted it. What chinese restaurant charges you for rice with sweet and sour chicken? They took it off the bill, literally pulled the rice off our table and brought it back to the kitchen (probably to serve to another guest). \n\nOur bill was $28 and the food was just enough to feed one person. My boyfriend is already getting hungry again and it's been about an hour since we left. My boyfriend suspects racial bias was the culprit here. \nThe plates being served to all the asian guests looked better and bigger than ours did. I think we got the worst part of the duck as well.\n\nAll in all I wish we would have gone to Ichiza down the street. :-/"

My sister and I exchanged glances and laughed at how awkward that was. Minutes, later another waiter came by to take our order, and kindly gave us forks and glasses of water. \n\nNow, I liked the food in Irvine's branch, so I expected the food to be just as good. However, the food was expensive also. Walnut pr0nz came out to 17 doll hairs, which is probably one of the most expensive pr0nz I've ordered. Seafood fried rice and shrimp chow fun came out to $10 each. We also ordered sauteed rock cod filet, which was about another $13. As you can tell, we only ordered seafood items. Yes I came here on a Friday and us Catholics are in the later stages of Lent. \n\nOur food came out in a reasonable amount of time, one item after another. As I hoped, the food came out excellent and cooked just right. The gravy on the chow fun was the perfect amount without masking the taste of the noddles and shrimp. The seafood fried rice had a good mix of suqid, scallops, and shrimp in it, and the rock cod was stir-fried to perfection with the wine sauce. I liked the walnut pr0nz too, but there was way too much mayo coated around it. It was a little overwhelming to be honest, and it was the dish I was looking forward to the most. Sigh. \n\nI had a good experience here with the food and service, which I suppose is rare based on what other Yelpers have said. I'd take my family here again, and hopefully I'll have just as good of an experience next time we go. Cash only. For a restaurant that charges a lot, they charge cash only. Come on!"

I felt like I was eating garbage, I could only finished half of the food because it did not taste good.\n\nThe quality of duck was so-so, very little duck meat and too grease.

As we were leaving, a lady (hostess? owner?) accused us of taking the knife even though we told her that we had left it on the table. She specifically told one of my cousins that if he didn't hand it to her directly that she would charge us ... this is after we had just spent $300 for our so-so, overpriced dinner.\n\nNever going there again nor recommending it to anyone - should have looked at the Yelp reviews before coming here, especially when there are better places nearby."

Then my friend asked \"Do you have duck?\"  The guy said no but then when we asked again, he said that they have duck.  OMG!  We got the plate, which is $9.20 for 2 pieces of duck.  There's 3 size servings for duck.  Whole, half, and plate.  When we got the bill, they charged us $14.95 for the 2 pieces of duck!  We didn't really question it at first and the paid.  As we walked out, I said \"Fuck that, there's not way that duck was $14.95!!!\" and I went back inside to look @ the menu.

The bitch lied. \n\nWalking in my appetite was immediately turned off with the hanging poultry and pigs in the entrance, but we carried on because we had a limited amount of time to eat with very limited options around. The place was dead which should have been a sign, but we got seated immediately but the decor was very.... off. I felt like I was in the 90's, maybe late 80's with the outdated surroundings. They did have hot tea that was waiting for us which was nice on the cold day, but this was essentially the only luxury we would be afforded. \n\nNot much to be had for the vegetarian set, but I got some mixed vegetable fried rice for $9 freakin' dollars. Granted it was on a huge plate, but I expected a mountain of vegetables with my rice. I could hardly find any damn vegetables in the entire thing. Not okay. My friend got a pork fried rice dish which she said was okay, but that was $9 as well. Two people eating just fried rice with a bill of $18. A bill of $18 which could only be paid with cash as we found out. And you know where the closest ATM is? All the way back in the Chinatown mall. It took my friend 5 minutes to run out and run back in. This had to be a joke, or maybe a conspiracy with the ATM people. We left a $20 bill and got the hell out of there, the service did not even try to exceed minimum expectactions.\n\nI was thinking about giving this place two stars because we did get seated quickly and the food didn't completely suck, but the experience sucked enough that I know I will never come back and there was no way in hell a very simplistic plate of VEGETABLES AND RICE costs $9. Also, they really should have decent signs or tell you BEFORE you sit down and order that it is cash only, something I have not heard in about a decade or so.

Since no server came to our table asking us on our choive of drinks, we asked for water from a nearby worker who was wiping a table. He didn't even acknowledge the request because he continued to look down and wipe the table. We thought he just didn't hear us since it was quite loud in the restaurant. He came back with the requested water later though. Experience at this location was pretty much going down hill after not being acknowledge for that request. While waiting for a server to stop by our table so we could place our order, I decided to do a quick YELP research of this restaurant. Was quite surprised to see such low ratings and bad reviews on the food taste!! I was ready to order since the menu had pictures which looked delicious, but from so many reviews on YELP, I started to second guess it. \n\nSince the experience was starting to go down hill and the reviews of this restaurant's taste is questionable, I informed my family of the reviews and after a quick decision, my family and I decided to leave.

Going oooo I love Sam Woo to my BF thinking it was just like the ones in Cali. \n\nFirst off, they didn't say cash only except for a dinky sign....had to make the BF do a little ATM run. Ugh. All the other Sam Woos took card so I didn't think of it.\n\nThe Hot Pot of Eggplant pork and Salty Fish was actually pretty good in flavors and the right balance with the salty fish. I liked this a lot but the rest is so inconsistent. \n\nThe roast duck was a bit dry . I'm used to the fatty ones with plenty of juiciness... how does a fatty meat get dry? Granted it was a bit skinny....and usually half is plenty but it wasn't. I had to order some BBQ pork and it was dry like it was sliced this morning and left out. Boo. \n\n I have gone to Sam Woos in Cali and they are a good chain of restaurants there....did not hold very true here. First those SW take card. They are very clean and have good service. The food is consistently good and the place is usually housed in a big space and it actually fills up. One even gave nice hot desserts at the end for free like a bowl of sweet corn or taro with tapioca. I liked Sam Woo in Rowland Heights, Ca so much that I indeed was a 1-2 times a month regular with my mom. \n\nSorry, but Sam Woo will stay on my CALI repertoire but not here."

We usually make it a point to come here right before heading home after a Vegas trip.\n\nOur experiences have always been positive - in their service and food quality. This last time that we were here, the kind older ladies that usually work the counter were not there and instead there was a 30-something hateful lady who was taking to-go orders. \n\nYou know sometimes you get those service people who randomly go out of their way to be a jerk \"just because\"? Well, she was doing that. I'm pretty sure she was pretending not to understand Cantonese, just for the sick pleasure of making us repeat ourselves over and over. Strike one. \n\nWhen she handed us our take-out, my sister was just trying to peek in the bag to make sure there were enough utensils for everyone. Mind you, no one was behind us in line, but the woman kept insisting that there were both forks and spoons inside the bag. Like a malfunctioning robot \"Forks and spoons are in the bag. They're in the bag. They're in the bag. They're in the bag...\" Um, crazy much? Strike two.\n\nOf course when we get to the car and check, there were no forks to be seen. When my sister went back in to get some forks, the woman feigned surprise like \"Oh really??? I thought I put them in there... oooooops\" To top off this bizarre experience, our order was totally wrong, and one box was missing from it altogether - which we unfortunately didn't realize until we were already on the road. Strike three. \n\nI would have given 1 star, but I will leave the extra star in hopes that the next time I'm in town, those sweet older ladies are back."

Whether it's a late night where you don't feel like cooking or if you feel like splurging on your diet, there is always loyal wholesome Chinese food you can rely on. Flavor and exotic taste is the promise of the American Chinese cuisine. Unfortunately \"Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant\" is NOTHING like what was mentioned in the previous sentences. Instead of the familiar tasty Chinese food we all know and love, it was a mashy mish slop of poor cooking and over priced bland food. We had a few dishes, but more than enough to complain about. After a week's trip at Las Vegas we entered this small, dirty establishment in hopes of being greeted with a fine Chinese dining experience. Our hopes were very very wrong.\n\nFirst we had ordered the Chinese white cut chicken, a salt marinated dish usually served as an appetizer or main meal. This was neither, instead it was an offensive dish to Chinese standards. There was literally no taste as if the cooks just had dumped the chicken in plain boiling water and went off to go do something else half-assed with their weak culinary skills. Several of the dishes after this were also the same, missing on any type of taste whether it was suppose to be a spicy beef cooked with eggplant or pork slices which were really soggy. They eventually served us the ong choy (chinese spinach) we ordered but upon closer observation we could tell that the vegetables were old and withered, all the parts that should be green were a sickly yellow. \n\nAnd maybe all of this could had been forgiven if it weren't for the smudgy dirty plastic dishes they used, the lack of a function AC in Las Vegas summer weather and especially the price the put on all of this tasteless food. For only 6 dishes the whole meal cost near $100 dollars! And they already threw in gratuity onto the check even though it was just 5 people eating. I guess this is the only way the waiters could actually make any tips because they seemed to lazily shuffle about and place down your food farthest from your seat. \n\nOverall this probably is the worst restaurant I have ever been. Definitely the worst chinese restaurant. I'm surprised how this place is still open after all the bad reviews. If these owners of this restaurant had a single shred of pride they'd do something and work toward fixing this dump and horrible imitator of real Chinese American cuisine."

It's just not the same anymore. I hate to say this but I think MGM's Grand Wok is a lot better than this place. Not only that...........the prices are comparable to casino restaurants. After the cab fare...........Sam Woo is probably more expensive. \n\nA real disappointment.\n\nFor a real decent Chinese restaurant off the strip................try Joyful House.

I had good memories of Sam Woo from a few years ago, and I've also been to other locations in LA.\n\nSo they messed up our combo BBQ order.  We ordered the triple combo: bbq pork, roask pork, and soy sauce chicken.  But when it came we got roast duck instead of bbq pork.  So we sent it back, and it took forever for the waiter to come back with our 2nd plate. And it was STILL WRONG!!! this time they changed the duck to the steamed chicken!! DId they not understand English??  Anyways we were not happy but decided to leave it alone and just ate since we were hungry and didn't have much time to spare. But even if we wanted to complain it would be hard to call back the waiter because the waiter dropped the plate without looking at us, almost like avoiding us and walked away instantly. \n\nWe also ordered a bowl of wonton soup which I had high expectation for - and it was just blaaah.. I found 2 big bones inside the wonton.  Couldn't really taste much shrimp in the wonton as I like it.  The third item we ordered was Yang Chow fried rice and they messed this one as well!  It was so dry my husband commented that even the free fried rice you get at chinese fast food place is better.  The last dish was Braised Tofu (Hong Shao To Fu) and it was okay.  Everything is overpriced!  Those 4 items cost us almost $50.  We left the place so unsatisfied and angry, what a waste of space in our stomach! \n\nOh and the front hostess who showed us our tables was also so unfriendly. Stay away from this place!!"

I've been searching this city for a long time for authentic char siu and haven't been able to find it. The chat siu here was quite good and I would say the best in the city (though still not hitting the mark for my search). The duck came with bone and all and a nice crispy skin. The platter was actually very large which was fortunate as $15 is quite expensive when there's other similar Chinese BBQ joints in town for about $5 less (albeit significantly smaller meat portions). The platter came with only the meat and rice which left me wanting a little as I like to have some greens in this type of dish, but I'll know for next time to order a side of Bok Choy or the like. \n\nThe restaurant is actually quite large and would be a nice sit down destination in the Chinatown shopping center. I'm not sure if they have lunch deals with soup, side, meat, etc. around $10 like the other comparableS in the city, but if so I think this could be the destination if craving close to quality Chinese char siu."

We were seated quickly and green tea was brought out to us. Their menu is gigantic! Omg talk about all the things. It seriously made it hard to pick. I knew I wanted something that had their tasty duck. When you first walk into Sam Woo's you are greeted by ducks that are cooking behind glass. After looking over the menu several times Joel and I both decided on the Duck Wonton soup with noodles. \n\nIt took a while for it to come out. But when it did that was one huge bowl of soup. It was literally filled to the brim. I was shocked the waiter didn't spill any out of either bowls on the way over to our table. On the top of the soup were sliced pieces of crispy duck. Mmmm duck skin. The broth was delicious and omg the wontons. There were probably 6 huge wontons and when I broke them open you could see actual shrimp in the meat mixture. They were so tasty. At the bottom of the bowl were noodles that I'm pretty sure we're made in house. What a tasty bowl of soup. All the ingredients worked so well together. \n\nNow the wait for the check and a to go container for my soup. It was about 15 minutes until we got our check. Once our waiter came an got our check and money he did bring our change back quickly. \n\nNot really sure why the service is so slow at Sam Woo. There weren't that many people there, but then again there was only one waiter. The food was so good it really didn't matter. If I'm in the Chinatown area I'll for sure stop in for that crispy duck!"

We got even more suspicious when the hostess asked us again how many were in our party & gave us a ticket with the number 8 on it. Things were obviously very disorganized.\n\nMy mom then caught the hostess' attention and asked her exactly how their seating was conducted, because we had been waiting awhile, parties were being seated before us that arrived after, and she wasn't calling any numbers. Her reply was, and I kid you not \"You know, don't worry about it. They have the bigger party and their table became available first. You just have to wait for a smaller table, so don't worry about it.\"\n\nIt was so rude. I think she realized she said something wrong, because as were were leaving (didn't want to patronize a place like that) she said \"I have your table ready for you now.\" My mother turned around, handed her the ticket back and said \"You know, don't worry about it.\"\n\nThe look on that hostess' face was priceless :)"

Soup was bland also but the flavor of the roast duck definitely helped spice up the soup a lot.\n\nI think you got the point of this review... BLAND ALL THE WAY!\n\nWhy is this place so packed? Is this really the best chinese food that Vegas has to offer that everyone comes here and forms lines in front of this place??\n\nMan o Man, they haven't been to Little Saigon or San Jose yet then that's for sure!!!!"

I'm a pretty big noodle fan and, to me, Sam Woo has the best Lo Mein in Vegas.  I always order the lo mein with oyster sauce and I always leave satisfied.  A lot of people complain about the service here but I really don't mind the waiters and their 'tude.  I think it's a kind of entertaining but that's just me.  The only thing keeping me from giving them a 5-star stamp is the simple fact that they have a sign that says \"CASH ONLY\".  What year is this?  Get with the times people!  I never carry cash so I really have to plan ahead and remember to pull some out of the ATM before I get here.  Remember.. the noodles are key here.  Just make sure you bring cash or the Chinatown mafia will probably come in and make those same noodles come out of your nose.  Or worse.  Just kidding... I hope."

The staff here is crazy rude and botched our take-out order to hell which didn't become obvious of course until we were home. It's insanely overpriced for a Chinese restaurant at $15 a dish and we were left with cold and tasteless food for dinner. Flat noodles and beef tasted like cardboard, clams in black bean sauce had four or five clams and the rest were empty shells, chicken wings had visible thick chunks (CHUNKS, not flakes) of MSG on them, and the vegetable dish we ordered was something else entirely. Bonus: we called back to point out this wrong order and they hung up.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs. Yelpers got it right.\n\nOh, and cash only so they can duck the IRS."

As for the servers, it usually averages out each time I had gone - ignored this time, really good service the next time. Most of the time I order the Hong Kong pan fried noodles, some bbq pork or if I am with my mom also some roast pork. Most of the time we also get sauteed Chinese broccoli (yes, I do broccoli if it is of the Chinese variety.) Everything is usually very delicious, very flavorful and not \"Americanized\" at all. \n\nLately, I find that I mostly go here during lunch time to order from their take away counter. It is always their bbq pork and rice. The old man behind the counter is pretty friendly and the young lady who rings up my order is pretty nice as well. For me it's a carnivores delight. So I guess if you don't want to risk the service at least try the counter where you can see them weight your food for the correct price :-)"

Whoever wrote all those reviews in any of the restaurant review magazines, websites, and articles giving this restaurant a positive light should be shot. Twice.\n\nI decided to use the 10best website to find myself an interesting place to eat, and discovered that my favorite one--Joyful--was number 10. Thinking that their taste was opposite of mine, I chose their number 9 spot-Sam's BBQ-and headed to Spring Mountain Rd. and Arville to try it out. First, Chinatown has horrible parking, so I circled for five minutes before stealing a space from some pissed off old man. After that, I walked into the restaurant, not impressed at all by the scenery.\n\nAs you walk in, there is a barbecue to-go station right in front of you. A small entryway to the overcrowded (fire inspectors should check this place out for safety) dining area. The hostess was not there, and it took us another five minutes to be recognized to be seated. Their menus felt greasy, only indicating how clean the place would be. I was worried the minute that I touched the menus about my food, but I was a trooper and pressed on.\n\nSince this place is a barbecue place, we ordered bbq pork (you know, the one with that red outer coating), honey walnut shrimp, and house special chow mein. The waiter rushed us to order, stood there with an irritated look when we tried to change our minds, and finally--and literally--ran off after closing the ordering with a rude \"yeah\". The food took about eight minutes, and the table next to us returned a bowl of soup after discovering dead flies (yes, SEVERAL) in her bowl. In the end, she still had to pay for it, mind you.\n\nWe receive our dishes and steamed rice that I was hesitant to eat. I've seen too many incidences whre rice is recycled from one table to another, but I had a bit because I could not have my walnut shrimp without it.\n\nIn short--for Chinese people who run this place, I believe they were raised in hicktown USA. They do not make good or even decent food. I am one to eat what I buy, but in this case, I couldn't torture myself any longer.\n\nTo be nice, I'll leave out the gorey details and state that it was the worst Chinese food I ever had in my lifetime.\n\nDo not expose yourself to this place. You will definitely have food poisining, as was the case this morning for me."

Where else can I go for some good Cha Siu (BBQ Pork), Si Yuo Ji (Soy Sauce Chicken), etc.  So when I saw the LV location when we're driving around looking for a place to eat, I was definitely interested.\n\nGoing in, it looked the same as the LA locations, as is the \"Cash Only\" sign.  Being an expert of Chinese food in the SGV (Most are cash only) and being in Vegas, my friends and I carried plenty of cash.  We ordered a few dishes: Ping Pan (A mix of a few different BBQ), Lo Mein, Fried Rice, and a few stir-fry dishes.  The food was OK, I mean pretty much tasted the same as the ones in LA, so I had no complaints.  My only complaint was why did they jack up the prices by $2-3/per dish??  I mean in Vegas, the real estate is cheaper than LA, so are the gas prices, what's the need for a Lo Mein dish being $9?  Then, I remembered the Banana Cream Pie I had at Emril's in MGM being $9, so I guess this was a steal!  If you're sick of Buffets and in the mood for Chinese food, this is a decent location."

Instead of Yelping, he picked this plaza, and then as a group we picked Sam Woo because of the brand name.\n\nIt wasn't until I checked in after sitting down that I noticed the two-star overall rating, which honestly shocked me a bit. In the end, I don't think the food is so bad that the whole restaurant deserves only two stars, but I will agree that it is not quite up to par with most Cantonese restaurants.\n\nThe eating bowls, plates, and cups were plastic, not ceramic, and looked a little cheap to be honest (and were this strange light blue color). Even some of our dishes were served on similar plastic plates (at least serve on plates with a little design if you opt for plastic)! I was surprised that the presentation of the dishes was so lackluster, given the pride the people from this region of China usually have about their food.\n\nAs for the food itself, it was decent but a bit too salty and oily, even for Chinese food. The menu was extensive but it was lacking some of the more prestigious/premium dishes, and where were all the quality soups? We ordered a vegetable dish, a tofu dish, a beef dish, a BBQ plate, and soup to share (see photos/captions). \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is still relatively nice looking, though not as sleek as some other Cantonese places. And while some others have mentioned poor service, I thought that the service during our meal was fairly attentive from both waiters to bussers (maybe it helps if you speak Mandarin or Cantonese).\n\nThis Sam Woo is not terrible by any means but I feel like it's not quite up to the well-established Cantonese restaurant standard, and there are a lot of options in Chinatown. Granted, I still have to try more places in Vegas Chinatown to get a baseline impression of food in this region, since my gold standard is still California restaurants and we are spoiled there.\n\nP.S. I've come to the conclusion that pretty much all of my lower-rated reviews have been at places that I didn't Yelp beforehand. Lesson learned: trust Yelp! If a place has more than just a few reviews by regular Yelpers, there is reason to take stock.\n\nP.P.S. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The waiter explained when he brought us our check that gratuity was already included. I thought this was kind of strange since we were only a party of 5. It looks like they do take credit card now (in reference to some older Yelp reviews of this place), but they have pretty high minimums (e.g. $20) and several categories (see the paper taped to the register)."

I've never back since and will never plan to go there. \nLet start my review of their BBQ side of the restaurant. I used to go here to buy BBQ duck or roast pork because they were the only one selling it. Their BBQ duck wasn't that good, but either that or driving to CA to get some. When you're threre, they treated you like #$%@ b/c it was crowded they didn't need you. Anyway, when King BBQ opened up a few block down the road, I didn't need SWBBQ either. KBBQ has much better roast duck and pork, definitely recommend it there. Now there are other places starting selling BBQ duck too, example would be the 168 market.\nNow let look at their restaurant side. We ordered a varieties of items on different trips there and all of them ranged from eehhh to mediocre. Most of the food were too oily.The floor and tables were dirty and the service was kinda suck.\nSummary, if you want Chinese BBQ, go to King BBQ down the road on Spring Mountain (and Lindell???)"

No wonder the lines aren't as long as they used to be.\n\nI recently went on the Monday after Christmas weekend and the wait was about a 20-30 min wait which isn't bad but the hostess didn't seem like she was able to organize a good table for us, let alone for other people who were already seated. They complained to her to change tables because their party was split and wanted to sit closer together. This caused more confusion for her to assign seating to following groups. Eventually, we were stuck with being put on a joint table with another group of 4 whom had already been seated. She didn't bother to move our table slightly away from theirs because that would've caused another problem; there wasn't enough space to walk by. It is good they have nicer tables, chairs, booths but it felt like they're not able to accommodate as many people within the confined space they have in the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered our usual food but it took at least 40-50 mins for everything to arrive at our table. Bussers would be seen running around, clearing tables, delivering food but I noticed they were getting a lot of orders mixed up. One of our dishes, the beef tripe, arrived AFTER we were almost finished with our meal that we didn't even want it anymore. They served it to us anyway because why not, let the customer eat the cost.\n\nSam Woo used to be one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to go to but just within a few years ago the quality has fallen quite significantly that I don't think I'll be coming back here to this Vegas location. I'll stick with the few surviving Sam Woos in California."

The fried noodles we ordered was basically blanched egg noodles with heavy starch gravy on top. Absolutely NOT acceptable in any Chinese restaurants, maybe it's acceptable in a mom and pop Chinese restaurant in the middle of nowhere. And for $12.95? Rip off.\n\nSeriously, this place is a rip off, $7.95 for a bowl of won ton noodle which normally is $3.95 to $4.95. $8.95 to over $20 for normal Chinese dishes? Are you kidding me?\n\nPlace is not so clean consider the decor is decent. \n\nThe army hair cut waiter digs his nose while serving you the dish as if to add extra flavor to the tasteless dishes.\n\nSave yourself time, money and aggravation, DO NOT go to Sam Woo in Las Vegas. And if you do because it looks attractive on the outside with the BBQ meats hanging, ask to see if the army hair cut waiter is working or not. Otherwise, extra 'black bean' in your dish."

Well, simply put, there is no comparison.  I don't know how these restaurants survive, when compared to the inexpensive casino foods and buffets.  I asked the server where to find good dim sum, and she says she goes to the Rio for the best dim sum.  Mind you the restaurant did not serve dim sum, so I felt safe asking the question of a local.  As for the food, it was meh, in comparison to the Sam Woo in Alhambra, which I have patroned for over 20 years.  I think it would be a nice touch to have the peking duck, roasted pig in the front showroom of this restaurant, but possibly, not many tourists order such dishes and so may not have experienced these fine dishes we have available in southern California.  If you have a hankering for Chinese food, there is no place like home."

That seemed to pique everyone's interest...the hungry group was ready to go as soon as I had mentioned it.   We managed to cram 8 people in the backseats of the Jeep Commander. Luckily, as the driver, I didn't have to feel like a sardine.  We headed toward Chinatown Plaza and reached our destination and piled out like clowns at the circus.  Sam Woo's was a blessing to many who thought they'd only be eating at the casino's the whole trip.\n\nI've been to Sam Woo's many times and have not been disappointed with the food.  It's typical HK/Cantonese food and reasonable for an individual or group.  They have Chinese BBQ, which includes roasted duck, roasted pork, BBQ pork, salted chicken, and soy sauce chicken, as well as other staples such as chow mein, chow fun, porridge, won ton, and other meat, vegetable, and seafood creations.  For this particular feast, we decided on a beef chow fun, chicken chow mein, honey walnut prawns, roast duck, bbq pork, spicy tofu, salted pork chops, Chinese broccoli, and Westlake soup.  Everything tasted good and seemed to satisfy everyone's palate.  \n\nThe Asian restaurant row along Spring Mountain Road has grown over the years, and there are probably similar restaurants that can deliver the same or better quality than Sam Woo.  But it's nice to have a goto place that you can rely on when you're craving Chinese food in Vegas."

This should have been a red flag but we stayed, regardless.\n\nWhile looking at the menu I realized it was a cash only restaurant (and the menu items are all fully priced). This relegated me to the cash that I had in my wallet -- bummer.\n\nThey have an excessively long menu and after a great deal of reading decided I'd just get the chicken lo mein since I thought that was un-mess-up-able. I thought wrong! I was presented with a huge dish of the nastiest tasting, ugliest pile of beige. The chicken was little more than tiny pieces of salty poached rib meat and gristle.\n\nSide note: the server had a fungal infection under his fingernails.

But I'll just try to explain how this place seems popular, but still sucks.\n\nThere are 3 ways to get people to eat at a restaurant:\n1. Establish your name. example: In-n-Out\n2. Make your business appear busy. If the place looks busy, it must be good.\n3. Word of mouth. example: Yelp\n\nSam Woo is highly regarded in California. So, when Californians see Sam Woo in Vegas, they must think this place is good as well. The reason this place is busy is because, particularly Chinatown Plaza (where  Sam Woo is located) is because everyday Asian Tour buses stops here, all of which are from California. So naturally, these people are aware of Sam Woo and decide to eat at this Sam Woo. The casual observer sees this place is busy, so it must be good. Don't be mislead! As long as tour buses continue to stop here and Sam Woo has a name in California, the tourist will continue to keep this place a float.\n\nSummary: Tourist trap that uses its name to get people to come, but won't return because of mediocre unflavored food and horrible service. But they're duck and pork is what saves this place.\n\nRecommendation: If you want Chinese food that doesn't suck, check out Food Express on Decataur and Sahara (not in Palace Station). Spend the extra couple of bucks on taxi fare to Food Express to avoid Sam Woo. Yes, the name makes you go WTF, but its a lot better than this place and is NOT fast food."

Be warned people - it's cash only!!\n\nThe food is \"okay\" but really, I've definitely had better Chinese food. And of course, being in Vegas, there's great food everywhere! But why do we keep coming back you say? They can accommodate a large party AND it's cheap!\n\nIf you come for dinner on Thanksgiving (not that many of you would) be prepared for a bit of a wait!\n\nThe honey walnut shrimp had too much mayo, the fried rice is a small portion, the sweet and sour pork was pretty good, the house special chow mein was great... everything else we had was unremarkable."

The service was another story. \n\nI can see what the other reviewer said about how if you're not Chinese (my bf and I are half viet) they totally disregard you. My boyfriend and I waited on our checks and boxes for our food for over 30 minutes! The servers were moving super fast catering to every other table except for ours. \n\nI had to give it only 2 stars because the service was just that bad. Will probably never come back, even if the food was good. Don't recommend this place because it's not worth dealing with the bad service!"

We ordered the Chinese broccoli, the Mapo Tofu, and the Three BBQ Meat trio (duck, chicken and pork). It was all really, really good! Very tasty, not too salty. The food did get cold really fast, because it was not piping hot when it came out, but that's not really a huge deal.\n\nThe biggest issue was just the service, I guess. Not rude, just more of a \"I don't really give a crap\" attitude. My guy was actually more upset about it than I was! But If you are really not bothered by just average, whatever kind of service, then stop in. The food makes it worth putting up with, for the most part.\n\nThey also have a to-go area up front, if you want to take that whole roasted duck home, or maybe that huge BBQ pork rack.\n\nOh yeah......

We ordered:\n\nSalted Pork and Century Old Egg Porridge: This was watery. Not enough pork and egg so I was disappointed with this dish.\n\nBeef Chow Fun: This was better than the porridge. It came out hot but the beef was kind of thick. There was a good balance between bean sprouts, beef and fun.\n\n2 choice meat (BBQ Pork and Duck): The BBQ pork was not cut right. It should be thinner but I've noticed a lot of butchers at all restaurants aren't cutting it right. Duck wasn't meaty at all. They just gave mostly bones. \n\nWonton Noodle Soup: Soup base is light so it seems that they had a broth but added more water to make more.\n\nService was ok. Only one waiter working and a cashier. They were also switching shifts when we came because we came here for an early dinner. \n\nThe restaurant is big enough for large parties. You can also take food to go.\n\nOverall, if quality of food is better, I would come back here again."

It was awful. \n\nThey sat us at a table which had a dirty order ticket on it. This thing was nasty, had what looked like dried meat juices from what must have spilled from another dish. \nThe place was actually quite slow, about 4 tables in total. \n\nAfter we were seated tea actually arrived promptly.\n\nWe waited about 10 minutes and wanted to order. I tried to flag a server who, even after making eye contact and turning his head towards me as I said, \"Excuse me\", completely ignored me and went to another table. I finally walked up to the cashier and asked the hostess if we could order. She brought over the very waiter who ignored us.\n\nOur order: 4 won-ton noodles and a plate of garlic bok choy. BAD!!! \nThe broth was bland and the won-ton had what tasted like nothing more than left over pieces of roast pork as a filling. No shrimp or minced pork or mushroom. Every other won-ton I have eaten consisted of a filling of shrimp and pork minced together. The bok choy was actually okay.\nTotal.... $49.00 + tip.  I should have listened to my intuition when we first pulled up.\n\nFunny enough when the hostess brought our bill she apologized for the dirty ticket they used. Why did they even use it in the first place?!?! That gross, dirty ticket was the first thing we saw when we sat down. \n\nWe were disappointed. \nService... poor. \nFood... almost as bad as the service. \nPrice ... way over priced \nHow do they stay in business?\n\nFor our next meal we landed up the street at KJ Kitchen which is only about 5 blocks away on Spring Mtn. Much, Much better. The Vietnamese Restaurant next door to Sam Woo was actually pretty good as well. \n\nDo yourself a favor, save your time, appetite and money by avoiding Sam Woo BBQ."

My husband had a craving for duck so we decided to have lunch there before heading home to Cali. I ordered the cod with tomato Sauce and he ordered the duck and pork bbq lunch special. When we got our  plates we both looked at each other with disbelief. The kiddie size cod portion with pile of rice, an egg role, and soup were all squished  on the plate as though it was just thrown together. The sauce tasted like sweet and sour rather than tomato sauce so I asked the waiter and he said it was the same thing. His duck portion looked like 1 small piece(small drumstick size) cut into small slices. Same with the pork. So small u could spoon up the slices in a spoon and eat it in one bite. The taste was just as worse as the appearance. Both  duck and pork were dry. It looks as though they just served the left overs. The egg drop soup salty. The bill was $19.36 for both. Such a waste of money. We just wanted a great meal before our long drive home. Instead we left feeling like we got conned and ripped off. NEVER will I ever step foot in that place! Oh, and before we even ordered the table next to us complained about a hair in their food. To make up for it we went to Thai noodle house across the street! Awesome food and geat prices!!"

We gazed in at a family of four dining through the window at Sam Woo like they were a puppy we interested in buying at the pet shop and it looked appetizing enough for us.\n\nWe had no wait to be seated on a Saturday night at 8 PM with the restaurant around 25 percent full. I didn't see the 350+ review, 2-star rating until after I checked in while we were sipping on some hot tea. So I told my wife we better play it safe for our order. We split the 3 item BBQ combination with chicken, roasted duck, and subbed roasted pork ($1) for BBQ pork ($17.95) and a bowl of wonton noodle soup ($8.25). I was actually very pleased with the combo. The meat wasn't overcooked topped with a vinegar based sauce with a herb aroma that I couldn't figure out. The meat went well with an order of steamed rice. My wife had the majority of the soup, which she was happy with, but had a strange odor to me.\n\nService that night was typical of many Chinatown restaurants: greeted, seated, menus dropped off with no other greeting, come back 5 minutes later to take entire order, food is dropped off, maybe see the waiter again, and pay up front.\n\nThe menu is very large with items numbering into the 200s.

And the Lo Mein that my boyfriend ordered was made with wonton noodles, which were tasteless and overcooked.\n\nThe language barrier we had with our waiter was difficult as well. I wish they would state to their customers before they take orders that they only take cash. The sign they have at the cash register wasn't eye-catching enough for us to notice on our own. I would also advise everyone to reevaluate your bill when they bring it to you. They write everything in Chinese so if you have a big order, it's hard to distinguish which item is which and whether they charged you the correct amount. Our large group has multiple separate checks and we found THREE miscalculations where they charged us more than the price that was displayed on the menu.\n\nOverall, this is not a restaurant that really cares about their customers. They find small ways to gyp you and just because my group looked Americanized, doesn't mean we like our Asian food Americanized. Not worth going to unless you're going to order the BBQ Pork and Duck.

If I could give this place 0 stars I would gladly do so. Sam woo used to be good, but their pathetic excuse for service has carried over and left a bad taste in my mouth. Way overpriced, will NEVER return, you couldn't pay me to!"

Immediately upon seating, an angry patron threw a few cents for tip onto the next table over. Not good. The waiter then comes by and starts laying out our plates. I notice one napkin on top of the plate being served to me slightly lifted into the air when the waiter was putting it down, but one corner of it did not. I inspected my napkin to see what could be causing the corner to stick to the plate, well to my surprise it was a booger!! Disgusting! We left shortly after. We didn't even bother to stick around for our drinks to come. Between angry patrons and boogers on my plate, I'd rather try somewhere else. This was over a decade ago and the service hasn't improved, nor their cleanliness, can't imagine how it is now."

What the hell, we just down.   The waiter didn't say anything and walked away and looked unhappy.  The third time he came, we were ready and he took the order . The food was decent except the tofu seafood soup, the fish was so fishy we were thinking returning it.   When we were almost done, the waiter walked by and just threw the bill on the table.  And he added 5 dollars tip on the bill of 45 dollars!!!   How the hell did he deserve that!!!   Well, we just paid and left, just won't go back again."

            "review": "Went here for a Christmas day meal and the menu and atmosphere looked promising. My wife ordered BBQ pork & rice, I had Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings. Waiter brought my wife's dish in about 5 minutes, but not mine. She didn't think it looked like BBQ pork -- I didn't know. She tasted it, said it wasn't and asked me to taste. I wasn't sure, but she called waiter over and asked if it was pork. He said no, that it was duck. My wife said she's ordered pork. Waiter disappears and a minute later appears with manager who tells my wife she can't return the dish b/c she's already eaten half of it (not even close). Manager says she can bring out BBQ pork, but cannot remake the dish. Waiter returns wife small separate plate of just BBQ pork & my wife has to separate the duck (which she doesn't like). Meanwhile, my food arrives about the same time. It was very tasty, but we'd planned on ordering something additional which we didn't do after the duck incident. Bill arrives, and they've charged an extra dollar for the pork replacement, plus added a $3 gratuity to the total. (Menu states gratuity for 6+ people; we were two adults + child.) We point this out to the waiter and he says, \"OK, OK, you don't have to pay that.\" Really, it doesn't matter how good the rest of the menu might be (and judging by my dish, some of it might be really good). What matters is the TERRIBLE customer service and handling of the incident. Will never ever return, especially with so many other options nearby."

Consistent Cha Siu and wonton rice noodle soup. Rice noodle soup was a bit over done and the noodles were breaking apart. Service was off, had to ask for a lot of things and the kitchen delivery guy just dump the dish on the table and ran, we order personal serving sizes not family style sharing. I had to self serve the dishes to my family, nice! Can I jump in the kitchen and cook too?!"

We know there is a Sam Woo in this neighborhood so we decide to check it out.  Of course it is more pricy than its counterpart in Los Angeles since a lot of ingrident had to be shipped from Los Angeles.\nThe service is alright.  They took our order and bring our food in a reasonable time.  Neither fast nor slow.  Typical chinatown service and decoration.  I came to eat not to look at the decor or talk to the waiter.  If you want to look, go to the casino located in the strip.  If you want to talk, talk to your travelling compansion or watch a comedy show.\nWe ordered:\nBeef chow Fun.  Very tasty.\nBBQ pork on steam rice.  Generous portion of pork.  Pork is a little bit on the salty side.\nShrimp Fried Rice.  Good wok Flavor but low in salt to bring up the taste.  Shrimp is small.\nSeafood pan fried noodle.  Could use a little bit of soy sauce.\nOverall, the food is Ok but not very delicious.  Service is OK.  Portion is not as generious as the Los Angeles counterpart and more pricy, however, this is located in the middle of a desert.  Everyone here charge more than Los Angeles."

I ordered wonton roasted duck noodle and the broth was salty. When we went into the restaurant we waited to be seated and no one helped us.  We both seated ourselves.  The waiter gave us the bill while we were eating and I stopped eating to pay for our food.  The waiter didn't even ask if we were done with our food and took away our meal when I wasn't even done with it.  I find that it is very rude of the waiter to not even ask if we were done with our meal before taking it away.  I would never come back and would definitely not refer my friend to this restaurant.  The the price for the food was not worth paying for."
