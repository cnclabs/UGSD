            "review": "The outdoor patio is gorgeous, and if you can manage to make it to this place when the weather is permitting, it's a nice place to sit and share a meal. The interior is nice as well, and has an upscale vibe like the 5-star restaurants on the strip. \n\nAs for the dishes:\n\nCharcuterie- Some notable cheeses with meats. Everyone's got their preferences w/ cheeses and meats, so I think you will find something you like by getting an assortment w/ a group. \n\nBRAISED LAMB BOLOGNESE - 5 stars. Oh my gosh, I was obsessing and thinking about it for a week after, wanting to go back. Well, you know how that works...we always find some other restaurant to try. But this  bolognese had amazing sauce, and it was creamy and fatty in a great way. \n\nCrispy calamari- 3 stars. Wasn't totally digging it. \n\nSeared sea scallops- 5 stars. Cooked to perfection. Scallops were sweet, flavorful, and delicious. \n\nBouillabaisse- 2 stars. Maybe the fact that I've had amazing bouillabaisse in France just sorta ruined it for me, but it tasted nothing like it was supposed to. The broth was overly salty and inedible. \n\nMedallion steaks - 2 stars. The meat was tough, and that already ruined it for me. The flavor was meh as well. \n\nBone-in rib eye- 4 stars. \n\nThere were couple other dishes I got to try, but the most notable that I'd go back for are the scallops and the braised lamb bolognese. Great service and nice ambiance!"

However, the last two times I've been there, I've been disappointed.  For starters, the  server seemed distracted and impatient with our questions.  It took a while to get our bread. My lobster ravioli tasted fishy, and  they took off their most amazing dessert from their menu- English toffee bread pudding.  Bring it back! Not sure this place is worth the drive from GV anymore. Oh, and did I mention it is very pricey?"

            "review": "During my trip to Las Vegas, our friends brought us to Vitner Grill for a lovely dinner.  The location is in a business area and may be easily missed, but find this place...it's worth it. First, the atmosphere is a throwback to a bygone era. I love the seating, the colors, the old movie snippets.  Our waiter, Michael, provided exemplary service.  He was engaging, knew the menu well and was fun!  Our party of four began with wine flights and glasses of wine along with a plate of fromage and carne. The duck was amazing!  I was happy my favorite sauvignon blanc from New Zealand was served here.  I loved how the butter was served molded into two wells filled with herbs.  The bread was tasty especially the cranberry -bacon and olive bread! Next my husband and I shared the Caesar salad wrapped in prosciutto. So good!  Our friends shared a Caesar salad as well. For our entrees, my husband and girlfriend had the sea bass, I had the halibut and my other friend had the scallops.  All the entrees were delicious (yes, I tasted them all!). I think I would order the scallops next time as they were huge and cooked to perfection. For dessert, my friends ordered the Turkish coffee cheesecake. We were too full to order dessert, but did nab a taste of their delightfully rich dessert...yum!  Everything we ate was not only pleasing to the eye in the presentation, but was pleasing to the palate.  I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you are staying close by at the Red Rock Casino Resort."

Waitstaff is great, and decor is lovely, especially outdoors during the summer months, twice the hostess was a little snooty however food, decor and service outweigh her attitude. \n\nMy favorite dish is the scallops, and the butter lettuce with brie salad, simply delightful and or course their pretzel bread is to die for.  In fact their simple butter presentation with olive oil is also so good.\n\nTheir wine offerings are great and cocktails are creative and yummy. I would recommend for date or girls night out."

We all had our phones out trying to read the menu with the light from our phones.  There was another table open with a huge lamp beside it and I would have thought once the server saw our issue, she would have asked us if we would like to move.  When our food arrived, we once again had our phones out using the lights to see.  Food was tasty, but, the bad lighting overshadowed what could have been a very awesome eating experience."

            "review": "Vintner Grill is proof that not all restaurants worth going to are located on the Las Vegas Strip. This hidden gem in Summerlin is perhaps one of the best local restaurants that Las Vegas and Summerlin have to offer.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit hard to find and located in an office building complex that catches you by surprise. Once you find the location, you walk past the most pleasantly decorated patio before you walk into the very metropolitan styled restaurant.\n\nFor starters, the Moroccan spiced lamb spare ribs with apricot glaze and carrot-almond slaw is an absolute must. The lamb is cooked to a perfect medium rare (and you should never ask it to be otherwise) and jammed packed with succulent flavor. \n\nThe risotto here is my go to entr\u00e9e of choice. The pan seared diver scallops with shaved pecorino, heirloom tomato and sweet corn risotto is creamy, smooth, buttery, and everything you could possibly wish for. I found myself dissecting the perfectly cooked scallops into smaller and smaller pieces so I could savor the taste as long as I could.\n\nThe prime beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie potato puree and grilled asparagus is big enough to feed two and the brie potato puree rivals the steak itself as the high light of the dish.\n\nTo finish it off, any restaurant that can make a decent macaroni and cheese is all right in my book, and Vintner Grill offers a macaroni and cheese side dish that is absolutely to die for.\n\nThe tiramisu dessert comes in a giant cup but is never enough to satisfy.\n\nThe restaurant is oddly adaptable. It's a great place to have a business meeting, a great place to take your friends to socialize, and it's also a beautiful restaurant worthy of a date night with a significant other.\n\nThe martinis at the establishment utilize an amazing assortment of fruits and berries and are quite delicious. The blueberry drink they had on their clip board drink list was refreshing."

I gave it three stars for the food only.\n\nThe gal at the podium was a snob. The waitress took forever to take our drink order and even then the bottle of wine took an additional 15 minutes to arrive.\n\nLove the food and I just have issues with the service."

We sat down in the back at a 2 person table.  We wanted to sit together so they let us turn the table sideways so we could both sit on the bench side by side!  Cocktails?  Huge wine selection.  I had a martini and he tossed some blue cheese stuffed olives in it.  It was fantastic.  Then the waiter brought out a bread tray with a good selection of breads.  I had the pretzel bread and the BACON cranberry.  Tasty!  I brought my lady here because she likes lamb.  I had the ravioli which was good and surprise......  She had the lamb appetizer ;) .  The lamb was a huge portion for the money and she took half of it home!  Great place, great atmosphere, good price for the experience.  I would return for sure!"

This particular culinary find is even better for Summerlin residents because it's in their own backyard. Vintner Grill is a hidden gem found in a small, unassuming business park located at 10100 W. Charleston Blvd.\n\nWalking up a few stairs to the outdoor dining patio, which resembles a warm resort beach sans the sand, you will notice the quaint, Old World lanterns hanging from trees. They are surrounded by two large, cabana-styled canopies and illuminated by wrought-iron chandeliers. \n\nUpon entry, I recognized the scent of a mesquite wood-fire oven lingering throughout the establishment. Led by the hostess, we passed a well-stocked, beautiful, wooden bar located to the right. We continued to wind our way through a myriad of white linen-covered tables and white leather booths with plump throw pillows. The ceiling was a shiny white Wayne's coating  that perfectly completed the black and white, checkered floor in this very contemporary setting.\n\nWe were seated at a large, round table near the patio and promptly ordered a cocktail, an Austrian Gruener Veltliner. I was pleased to find several other wines by the glass from the extensive wine list, which includes labels from around the globe. They also offer 30 select beers from around the world.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nFor starters, I had the wood-fired flat breads. One had grilled white asparagus, portabella cream, fontina cheese and shaved black truffles. And another was topped with prosciutto, roasted sweet peppers and micro-arugula in white truffle oil. The first flat bread was a perfect balance between velvety fontina, earthy black truffles, and crunchy white asparagus. The other would have been better if the chef had used Italian as opposed to domestic prosciutto. Even the drizzled white truffle oil could not mask its much too salty taste. \n\nNext, from the appetizer menu, was an unbelievable good tasting  yellow heirloom tomato gazpacho. This is a chilled Spanish tomato soup with an offering of brunoise (finely chopped) tomatoes, fennel, green pepper and onions. The rich texture was created by cleverly blending pita bread into the soup. \n\nNext, was a Caesar salad with a refreshing approach. Romaine leaves, enveloped in prosciutto, contrasted sharply with radicchio leaves and was served with grissini (breadsticks) and a hard-boiled quail egg. The dressing was a fine symphonic creation of delicately and masterfully blending lemon, anchovies, garlic and Parmesan cheese. Only a tableside dressing prepared by the most seasoned waiter could have come even remotely close. \n\nUnfortunately, the steamed Little Neck clams in a broth were overly seasoned with too much of an herby (rosemary/thyme) character.\n\nTraditional pan-seared Dungeness crab cakes with a tarragon cream sauce were better than average due in part because the chef did not use a lot of filler.\n\nThe lamb spare ribs were deliciously tender, rubbed with a Moroccan spice and served with an apricot glaze.\n\nOliver Kern was trained in Vienna, Austria, specializing exclusively in the European culinary arts and has worked in some of the finest dining establishments throughout Europe and the United States. \n\nFor the entire review of Vintner Grill please visit www.freshfoodnews.com"

            "review": "It's a Sunday night, and my parents are in town to visit. My brother had suggested this restaurant since my mom really likes seafood. I honestly never heard of this restaurant even though it was on Food Network or something like that. The restaurant is hidden in some business center, but usually the good restauants are a bit hidden. Once we got inside, we were seated right away. The decor is nice and mellow which is my kind of place.\nWe started off with the spicy chicken flat bread. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. The calamari had a nice mustard sauce that wasn't over powering. The crab cakes were just ok.  \nThough my mom likes seafood, she decided to order the roasted half chicken. She described the chicken as having an amazing crust. It was very crispy while the meat was still juicy.\nI had ordered the halibut with spinch and cous cous. Like the chicken, the fish had a very nice crust while still maintaining its tenderness. The only downside is that the cous cous out shined the main dish. It had the perfect amount of seasoning and softness. The tomato halves added a sweetness and slight tart to the cous cous. You have to eat the halibut with the cous cous for the additional flavor, but the cous cous could be eaten alone. In fact, I ate all the cous cous and left my half of the fish.\nAll in all, the restaurant wasn't bad. Nothing truely wowed me, but I can't say anything bad."

            "review": "This place is super cool as far as decor goes, and the food is pretty tasty as well.  However, I am deducting a star for service.  We felt as though we were not welcomed and actually a bother to our server.\n\nWe arrived 15 minutes early for our 8.30 reservation, and were happy to be seated early.  The hostess and (i'm guessing) the manager were extremely friendly as we walked in the hostess was pleasant and happy as she seated us.  It ended there.\n\nWe sat for another 15 minutes before our waiter actually came by.  Between that time, plenty of wait staff passed by or cleaned off tables, and no acknowledged us.  When he finally arrived, he took our drink orders and dropped off our menus.  It was close to another 10 minutes until our drinks arrived.  At which point we were still deciding on the dinner selections and asked for a couple more minutes to decide.  And we waited.  And waited some more.  A couple of minutes turned into another 10 and when he finally returned, he told us \"we close at 9 so I have to take your order now\".  Excuse me?  I was so taken back by the attitude, I actually forgot what I had decided on.  He didn't show any interest in speedy service, so why I should I be inclined to quickly order? \n\nOur food arrived in a timely manner and was very good.  We ordered the Crispy Half chicken, Butter Lettuce salad, Beet Salad and Barley Short rib soup.  However, with the salads, our server was way behind the curve with the pepper offering, we were halfway done.  But,they also make an excellent Moscow Mule so that makes up for something.\n\nAs we were clearly done with our meal, our server passed us by a few times over as he put out napkins at the surrounding tables and did his work to finish the night.  And after rushing us to order, offered us dessert or coffee to finish the meal.  But we already had decided that we didn't want to stay any longer and be ignored.  He \"hoped we enjoyed our meal\" but I would rather him be more involved with our meal and enhance the experience. Great food, great decor and crappy service? I'm not inspired to come back and would recommend elsewhere first."

Walking in, the dining room is a beautiful vision in white. But not the kind of uncomfortable white you wouldn't want to touch & mess up.  It's the exact opposite, cozy & inviting with white tablecloths, leather booths and worn in black & white wooden floors.  The bar area is done just like the dining room so if you can't get a reservation, a seat in the bar area is just as good.\n\nThe service is good, the food is better.  The flatbread with proscuitto & white truffle oil was delicious.  Loved the calamari was yummy as well. For dinner we ordered the braised beef stroganoff, beef tenderloin with brie potato puree, & the lamb osso bucco.  No vegetarians at our table!

The decor and music was perfect. Nate King Cole style.   We could actually have a conversation,  imagine that.  Parking is close and free!   The food highlights were the octopus appetizer, the cauliflower and crab soup but the Mediterranean Sea bass was the show stopper.  We finished with the mango desert and chocolate pie. I brought 2 bottles of wine and corkage was $30 a bottle.  Total bill for dinner for 4 with starters and appetizers then seafood entree and desert along with a $60 corkage fee came to $300.   Amazing value.   But the service made it so much fun.  Sento was our server and she is so warm and easy to connect with.   Her wine service was professional and she brought the Chardonnay temp down with the ice bucket which I appreciate.   Sento and her team were excellent.   I will be back!"

            "review": "My BF surprised me with NYE dinner here. We had reservations for 8:45pm. We showed up early and weren't seated until almost 30 mins after our reservation. I get that reservations aren't precise, but the wait kind of defeated the point of making a reservation. And we only got updates when we went up and asked. So that was a little bit frustrating.\n\nOnce we were seated, the service was great, especially considering the crowd. The atmosphere is awesome. I loved the decor. Light and open, but still romantic and nice. It felt very NYC to me.\n\nI appreciated that they had both a prix fixe menu as well as the regular menu offerings. We opted to basically create our own shared 3-course meal. We did the calamari, followed by the crabcakes, followed by the beef tenderloin. And they were very nice about splitting the plates for us.\n\nThe calamari was fabulous. Great breading. The lemon curry dipping sauce was phenom! The added curry was so unique and went splendidly with the calamari. Thank you Yelp reviews for the recommendation on the calamari - it most definitely did not disappoint. (5 stars)\n\nThe crabcakes were good, but not memorable. I liked that they were small and extra crispy on top. Aside from that, though, I've had better. (3.5 stars)\n\nThe beef tenderloin was superb. Tender and juicy and cooked just right. And the peppercorn sauce was done just right and was the perfect compliment to the meat. The asparagus was good. The brie mashed potatoes were amazing! (5 stars)\n\nAll in all, it was a great meal. We never felt rushed and we enjoyed each course. I would most definitely eat here again."

Well, this place popped up and I figured I would give it a try because it had some solid Yelp Reviews. Wow.. Wow.. totally amazed by this place. It is in a weird location and makes no sense as I thought my GPS was malfunctioning or something. In a business park like setup. Strange, but this place is a gem. \n\nMake reservations as it was packed on a Friday Night, but I lucked out and a high top opened in the bar. So we ordered the calamari, a NY steak, and salmon on rice. Every one was amazing. \n\nI am a real salmon snot being from Seattle. I was impressed with the flavor of the fish and the perfectly paired vegetables with rice. Amazing.\n\nSteak was done very good and served on a bed of garlic mini potatoes. Very good and it all meshed perfectly. \n\nI will hit this spot again and again and work my way down the menu. A great date spot, dressy and high end, so be prepared for it. I wasn't and felt a under dressed. However, I am lucky that my girl is really attractive so nobody really notices me anyhow. So I just tried not to move much and remained invisible while under dressed."

Yes, that establishment that gains accolades for its food & has been in business for plenty of years now to create one that's readable.  Not only is it a garbled menu with huge print, but there are no prices.  The choices look palatable enough, but why would I dine at a high-end restaurant if it cannot even present its \"package\" to me in a more readable & sophisticated manner, with prices?  I know, the days are gone when menus were stolen by diners because they were works of art, as I reminisce on Chicago's Stockyard Inn and Milwaukee's Frenchy's, but my expectations are lower now and I just need \"readable\" with the price tags.\n\nI called Vintner's a month ago to request they e-mail me a menu.  After a few tries, I was told they were unable to do that.  I explained how it behooves them to create a new menu and the woman on the phone said \"Oh, yes, we know; we're working on that!\"  Seems not."

It makes for nice background visuals.  \n\nIf you reserve on open table I think there is only one table they seat you at and it is next to the server stand.  You might want to call if this annoys you. It does put you in Josh's section so that's the plus side.  \n\nThey also make tasty drinks and stock Laphroaig.  The last waiter (not Josh) put ice in my scotch, since I did not ask for it on the rocks it was annoying.  However it is a cardinal sin to waste scotch.  \n\nI love that it is not in a casino and that it is quite low key. \n\nI wish they hosted a Casablanca night."

They replace the scallop dish with a plain salmon dish.  The salmon was burnt.  That was also returned.  The other diners had the beet salad, o.k., and the sea bass, not taste at all, and a bouillabaisse, most of which was left in the bowl-no taste.\nThe waiter never brought us water and we had to ask five times for bread for the table.  The most disconcerting part was that no one apologized for the poor service or food preparation.  The restaurant has a very attractive setting.

Perfect salad with the right amount of crunch from the toasted hazelnuts.\n\n\nEntrees:\n\nMoroccan braised lamb tagine with couscous. It stood out when the tagine was brought out steaming from the chimney and the lid was lifted. The lamb was rich and tender. It was a bit salty though. I felt like it should've been served with more couscous for at least 2 people to share. (I polished it off, but it took effort). \n\nDessert\n\nBlueberry - Meyer Lemon Cheesecake wasn't dense. It was so creamy. \n\nTiramisu = comes in a large coffee mug. It was fantastic! Instead of the traditional lady fingers. They use layers of chocolate cake. It was more about chocolate, then coffee notes, then the marsala. I personally like it in reverse order when I make tiramisu.

It must be divine intervention! I would have missed out on this amazing journey.\n\nFrom start to finish it was a splendid experience. A friend and I came directly after work. We got there half an hour early for our reservation and sat at the bar. I tried the Capone's Rye. It is one of those cocktails that gets more intense the longer it sits. As it adjusted in temperature, the more I can taste all of the alcohol. It is a true martini in nature. All alcohol and very little filler. Rye whiskeys are making a comeback and I want to get into them. Maybe next time I will take baby steps. One cocktail was more than enough for me. \n\nWhen our third person came, we were sat promptly. We decided to all do the special menu. The online version made it seem like the diner had to choose between three set menus. When looking at the paper, it is all presented as a mix and match of your liking. We decided to skip the beef barley soup and opted for two pumpkin gnocchis and the wedge salad. Smartest move EVER! The gnocchi was hands down the best dish of the night. Our server was considerate enough to split anything that could be divided. The pumpkin gnocchi tasted like fall. All the traditional spices; cinnamon and nutmeg is present in them. The proscuitto and blue cheese added a nice saltiness. The bitterness from the arugula gave the dish a nice contrast in texture. The same could be said about the roasted hazelnuts. Sweetness came in the form of poached pears. The wedge salad was also very good. Just not as good as the gnocchi. In hindsight, we should have all just got our own plate of that.\n\nWe then ordered one of each entree. The truffle glazed chicken had a beautifully brown and crisp skin. The glaze is slightly sweet and complimented the savory mac and cheese well. I was shocked by how moist the chicken was. The steak over a bed of pureed parsnip was decent. The veggies and parsnip was my favorite part. Why not puree other root vegetables? Especially sweet ones. Potatoes are a thing of the past. The halibut was also another item I was thoroughly impressed with. It was cooked to perfection. The outside seared crispy and the center moist. I devoured my piece and the couscous within minutes of it hitting my plate.\n\nOne of my dining companions and I was not as enthusiastic about the desserts. All of them were not seasonal selections. They had a berry theme to them, They were still decent. We were so stuffed by this point that it did not even matter. The trifle with strawberries was the highlight offering. The lemon blueberry cheesecake was second. The panacotta had too much gelatin in it. It was stiff."

            "review": "Thank the lord there is places like Vintner Grill that I can take my Las Vegas guests too instead of the overpriced restaurants on the Strip.  \n\nI went here for the first time several weeks ago, and I was completely taken by surprise.  It really is unexpected to find a restaurant like this in an office park.  The place was busy (in a good kinda way) on a wednesday evening.  It looks like a hangout for the young professionals in Vegas.  \n\nSo the bar/lounge/waiting area is separated from the dining area of the restaurant with glass screens that play movies on both sides of them.  It was an old Humphrey Bogart movie called To Have and Have Not... \"You know Steve, you're not very hard to figure, only at times. Sometimes I know exactly what you're going to say. Most of the time. The other times... the other times, you're just a stinker.\"  Anyway... so me, My T., Thao N, and Humphrey B., were seated at a table.  \n\nThe bread man came.  And it was served with butter.  By the way, you must go to this restaurant to see how the butter is served, never seen it done in this way.\n\nSo I had never had wild boar before... so we ordered some with cheese in the beginning.  And we also ordered a wild boar bolognese pasta.  I was a little freaked out at first, but my god, that was delicious.  There are a bunch of small plates, I can tell you what I got, but I would suggest just ordering what fits your needs.  I'm a calamari, beet salad kinda guy.  \n\nHave fun!"

These were full on entrees, so we definitely could have passed on the calamari we ordered as an appetizer, which was pretty forgettable. Our entrees tasted amazing.. I honestly think the half chicken is one of the best chicken dishes I've ever tasted in my life. \n\nFor all the wine lovers.. they have a huge selection. After all, the place is called Vintner (wine maker). We did not get any wine, but we tried the pear-tini which was strong but delicious.\n\nI was a bit wary of this place due to recent reviews about the service. Our server was Jeff, and he was pretty stellar. No complaints there. However, we did have some dirty plates and utensils upon being seated, but that was taken care of promptly.\n\nThe decor is also amazing. There were people who were dressed up, there were people who dressed casually. Personally I'd feel a bit out of place if I just donned jeans."

Weather was great so we sat outside. I've always thought they have a great atmosphere inside and out. \n\nTonight the service was excellent (other than when making reservation asking if celebrating an event and totally forgetting once we were there). I think service is the most important thing. The right people and you'll love the place. Last time when we had an issue and management handled it poorly. It was obvious they didn't care to make things right when a server slipped and spilled oil all over me. Accidents happen. How they're handled is what's important. Ignoring the spilled oil, the server last time was awful on top of error.\n\nThey really deserve more than 2 stars, but I'm still annoyed from what happened years ago and from a general feeling of non caring overall. \n\nTo be fair the food was very good. Had ravioli with crabmeat which was very good, an excellent New York strip and generally it's a cut that isn't so great so I was impressed. A very good beet salad as well as a pork rhubarb and watermelon appetizer. Our waiter was excellent. I just like to go to places where the people working seem happy to have your business. If staff reads this and contacts me I'll explain my issue with you. I'm not going to waste tempers time going into it. \n\nThanks otherwise, but there are so many restaurants if I don't hear it's really improved we'll stick with some others."

This place used to be packed and without reservations you couldn't get in.  Prime time Saturday evening and if was a quarter full I would be surprised.\n\n2. The vibe was bad and the employees seemed... well... beaten down.  I'm not sure what's up but unhappy employees make for a poor experience.  My guess is a change of management is in order.\n\n3. The ever present smell of old fish still permeates the air.  Even if the the ventilation system int he kitchen needs improvement... fresh fish doesn't smell that way when cooked.\n\n4.  I ate at the bar and actually had prompt and pleasant service by the only bartender - Char.  She was the saving grace of the evening.\n\n5.  I ordered the crab cake appetizer which I felt was risky based on the old fish smell.  It actually wasn't half bad but then I was into my 2nd martini when it arrived and pretty hungry.  I little too dark on the outside but didn't taste burnt but tasty.\n\nThis is my 2nd not so great review and the last review the manager wrote me privately and asked me to give them a 2nd chance.  My response was \"why should I?\"  but I did it anyway.  I'm sad to say if it hadn't been for Char, the whole experience would have been worse.\n\nIt's a shame such a beautiful restaurant with abundant outdoor seating that's both comfortable and lovely is clearly mismanaged and well past it's prime.  I think they are going to have to work pretty hard to pull themselves out of what seems to be disfavor and probably need to hire a restaurant consultant to get some objectivity and change staff, etc.    Perhaps Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares can help eradicate the horrible odor and fix what ails Vintner Grill."

Patio is reservations only after 8:30pm, (probably earlier in winter, so get there early if you're walking in).\n\nThe service is upscale (they match dinner napkins to the ladies attire in a lovely subtle way), which mean waiters can be snooty occasionally, but most are quite personable and answer questions sans-attitude.\n\nThe frommage course is not to be missed...a delicious assortment with exquisite drizzles.   \n\nBy the time I get to main course, I'm usually buzzed and stuffed w/cheese...and there ends my review.\n\nLovely atmosphere, white furnishings, silent films playing in some of the cubbies, and an accessible bar area with additional bar table seating.  So great for a quick classy drink, or a leisurely 4 course meal.  Enjoy!"

The restaurant is gorgeous and the people are fun to watch but that's not why I go out to eat.\n\nRecently my friend invited me for lunch, telling me about the Classic Cobb Salad with Tenderloin Steak ($14).  That was it for me.  On a scale of 1 to 10, it is a 12.  Add the ambience for lunch, which is more business and \"Summerlin ladies who lunch\" and it's the perfect combination.\n\nI have since been back 5 times in the last month (embarassing, actually) with different friends and clients.  I order the same thing every time - it's that perfect.  Not to mention their breads.  They have a cranberry-bacon roll that is beyond great.\n\nI usually don't drink wine during the day but I had their Sauvingon Blanc Drylands ($9) and now have a new favorite, too.\n\nThis week I went with my wife and I had dessert for the first time.  It was their warm peach cobbler/pound cake with ice cream and caramel sauce.  They give it a very fancy name but that's what it is.  It is crazy delicious.\n\nThey have outdoor seating, which I would only do at night during the summer.  This is a really gorgeous restaurant and you don't feel like you're in Summerlin or a business park.  I highly recommend it."

At expensive restaurants they tend to take their time so you don't feel rushed, but our server was either overbooked or completely unaware I was trying to get his attention so we could order appetizers before our other guests showed up.  He appeared overwhelmed and focused on too many things at once.\n\nAmbiance: (READ BELOW) Upscale yet Tacky at the same time. \n\nWhy this place gets a 2:  This is the first time I've been at an upscale restaurant where they play movies on giant screen TVs during dinner.  It was VERY ODD.  This was also my first time here and we had work guests with us so you'd think when they placed us at a table they'd ask us if we'd be alright with a giant TV to my back (Literally behind me).  No one was even watching the movie so I asked them to turn it off, so the server said he'd take care of it.  It never turned off.  \n\nThen I grabbed him again and asked him if they were going to turn it off, then he \"apologized\" and said we \"always play movies during dinner\" ... So not sure if this guy is dumb or he  just wanted to shut me up by telling me he'd turn it off the first time I asked him.   \n\nLong story short I had decent food but had to watch bright lights repeatedly bounce off my guests faces since they were facing the TV.  This essentially killed the entire dinner mood and we ate as fast as we could and left.  I won't be taking my clients here anymore."

We almost turned around but decided to keep an open mind...and so glad we did!\nSat at the bar and Ryan was our server/bartender. He informed us that he could make any cocktail and on top of that make any cocktail we wanted but better.\nHe was not kidding.\nThis guy was a master mixologist! So happy we didn't have to go Downtown or to the Strip  (and pay ridic prices) to have these kind of amazing cocktails. \nPrices were reasonable ($13-ish for drinks,) considering the high quality of food and drink. I mean, we also love the cocktails at Jaleo but $20 for a drink is just absurd. We also had a charcuterie and chesse plate ($21) as well as a top notch aged NY strip which Ryan had split for us ($40.) \nIt's a shame that as non-Red Rock Country Club types we don't feel totally comfortable here. However, considering the ultra high caliber of food and drink, we'll be back. Sitting at the bar is definitely the way to go to enjoy Ryan's spectacular mixology and bypass the crowd and stuffy vibe.\nThis place really deserves 5 stars for food/drinks/service,  but we took one star off for douchiness."

We had a friend take us for lunch a while back and I really had a bad experience. We came back recently for a group dinner and my experience changed. I always loved the decor, its very different, trendy, bold colors of green, white, black. We started with the calamari and hummus. The calamari came with a curry flavored dip which was very good. I don't like their menu because it's pages on a clipboard and you have 1 page of cheese, 1 page of food, and about 15 pages of wine. We tried a meat and cheese plate which seemed good although I'm not a big fan of that. For my entree, my bf ordered the boar pasta, and it had a very good flavor to it. I debated between the halibut and the bouillabaisse. I've never really had the bouillabaisse but I only wanted to try it because it said it had saffron in it. And it looked good with baby lobster, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari. The waitress said that dish was featured in wine magazine so of course I had to go with that dish. It was delicious, very light, and the seafood was all delicious. \n\nMy only complaint was the service was a tad bit slow when we were ordering but maybe that is because we kept ordering appetizers, the wine took awhile to order, (so the waitress and sommelier were busy taking these orders and setting our table with wine glasses and such). \n\nWe also had dessert and the portions were HUGE! It's enough for maybe 3 people to share. So we tried the strawberry shortcake, the chocolate eclairs which were soft, but i thought eclairs were crunchy, and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was my favorite although everyone else thought it was too sweet."

I absolutely loved many things about this place, but there are definitely some aspects I think they could improve upon.\n\nThe decor, the lighting, the free valet parking, the comfortable seating all scream luxury, yet with an air of comfort and homie-ness. The staff matched that with their warmth and friendliness. Our server did a good job. Not fantastic, but good. The service seemed to get a little lazy at the end.\n\nThe first two courses were terrific. We started with cheese (faux pas!). The sheep's milk petite basque was sharp and mildly pungent. The truffled ricotta was creamy and luxurious. Both were delightful with the homemade strawberry and apricot mustard jams they were served beside. We also had the venison salami which was good but nothing special.\n\nI judge crab cakes based on what they are garnished with (since they all taste about the same to me). This variation has a beautiful, creamy tarragon vinaigrette, some peppery greens and a tangy,  sweet roasted bell pepper relish. The combination was divine.\n\nThe baby gem \"wedge\" salad was also a refreshing combination of flavors: tender baby gem lettuce, with large chunks of piquant blue cheese, salty and crispy pancetta, sweet poached pears, tomatoes and a blue cheese-bacon dressing.\n\nThe main courses were decent. Jen got the saut\u00e9ed salmon. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite fresh tasting, though overly salted. The lobster sauce was decadent and creamy. The mashed potatoes were a little cold and had a strange tasting spice in them (maybe cardamom?).\n\nI had the roasted, boneless half chicken with truffle glaze and cavatelli served \"Mac and cheese\" style. The skin was perfectly crispy and the glaze was sweet and luxurious. Unfortunately, the chicken itself was a little dry (as it tends to be if not brined). The cavatelli, though creamy and cheesy needed some salt. It was also served with some broccolini that was still very crunchy.\n\nDespite its minor faults to an otherwise lovely dining experience, I enjoyed this place and will be back."

We sat outside on the patio and had a fantastic meal. We made a reservation to celebrate our three year anniversary on Sat, 7/23.\n\nOur reservation was for 7pm. We arrived about 6:40 and had a cocktail at the bar (our bartender Mark was fantastic). We went back to the hostess at 7:10 to be seated on the patio as we had requested when we made the reservation, only to be told it was closed for a private party. It would have been nice if they had contacted us to let us know but okay, not a huge deal. The hostess wanted to seat us at a two top but we asked for something where we could sit next to each other (that was a big part of the reason why we requested patio seating). She said she'd have to check with the manager. We went to sit on a couch by the hostess stand while we waited and she told us that we could not sit there because it was reserved (even though there was no one around). After ~5 minutes, the manager said he'd have something ready for us in 20 minutes. At this point, my boyfriend wanted to leave but I convinced him to stay. Since we could not sit on the couches, we went back to the one open seat at the bar and Mark asked what happened. We explained and he offered to comp a round of drinks (thank you Mark!) We were about to order the lamb meatballs when the hostess told us our table was ready. We took our drinks to our table and immediately asked our server Michael for the lamb meatballs. He said they can't serve bar menu items in the dining room. I understand that but we were only at the bar because our reservation was messed up. He said he could check with his manager and we asked him to. He came back - the manager said no. \n\nLuckily, things went nowhere but up from there - the cheese plate was fantastic, the wine pairings were decent, the lamb bolognese was delicious and they wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate (our server grabbed the first dessert they brought out and promptly returned with the decorated plate). \n\nAll that being said, we were seriously considering hosting our engagement party here and while the food is fantastic,\nI really hesitate to go back based on the way our evening started off."

The greeting from the hostess was warm and friendly and we were seated right away. The white modernistic decor was very soothing, the music was appropriate and at a comfortable volume, the Woody Allen movie scenes playing on the few televisions was fun, and our waitress (I'm so sorry I've forgotten her name. Young lady, slightly pregnant.) was very prompt, knowledgeable and courteous.\n\nWith over 400 wines on the list, we chose the Bouchard Pere & Fils \"Beaune du Chateau\" 1er Cru Burgundian Pinot Noir. Great choice to be able to pair with most menu items. Light notes of cherry and strawberry, light spice, medium body, light hints of oak. Very much a standard example of old world pinot noir. Tasty.\n\nA large selection of fun breads to choose from was presented by the very cordial bus staff and the butter presentation was really fun also.\n\nWe started with V.G.'s version of Calamari. Fried lemon wheels and fried haricot vert accompanied the well cooked and seasoned delicacy. The sauce however, was the star of the show. Cilantro, salt, pepper, and a light curry was a welcome change from the standard marinara that usually accompanies this dish. Well done Chef.\n\nMy wife ordered the Salmon Tajine. The sauce was flavorful, and the vegetables were well done. The salmon seemed to lack the \"sear\" that we normally enjoy but overall a good dish. It was a little cumbersome to eat though.\n\nI ordered the braised lamb bolognese. Incredibly flavorful braised lamb over slightly over cooked pasta in a VERY rich bolognese.  The most fun part of the dish was the cold Mascarpone cheese topping the dish that was an incredibly exciting juxtaposition to the hot, thick bolognese. Again, well done Chef. I was halfway through the dish when I found myself overwhelmed by the richness. Very good, but quickly filling and rich.\n\nThe only reason that I can't give 5 stars on this visit is that our entrees arrived before our appetizer was cleared and there was no attempt to crumb the table. But I must reiterate that we had a wonderful time with our server and she was outgoing, hospitable, knowledgeable and helped us have a great time. Thank you Vintner Grill, we needed that."

I certainly am not one that is afraid, ashamed, or even bat an eye twice at the idea of dining alone, so I made a last minute reservation to check it out.\n\nWhat I immediately noticed was that I loved the overall design of the restaurant.  It is posh yet casual... almost like it doesn't take itself too seriously.  I also noticed the clientele.  Many people seemed to be out on a date-- or in one case I swear the guy was out with a mistress.  Others were discussing business.  It also was a nice touch to have from Here to Eternity playing in the background.\n\nWhen i walked in the hostess asked me if I was there to eat my favorite dish.  I told her that I hadn't eaten there before and figured there was no time like the present.  She smiled and said that I would enjoy it and took me to a table in the back corner.  My waitress was very thrown by the fact that I was dining alone.  It took her about 1/2 of my dining experience to adjust.  Everyone else on staff didn't mention it at all. In fact, they seemed unphased.  When I asked her what did she suggest as one of their best dishes on the menu, she couldn't give me an answer.  \n\nI started with a salad, which had artichoke and corn-- amongst other vegetables.  It was so fresh, and the corn was so sweet. The bread was better than average.  This definitely was one of the better salads that I have had in a long time.  For my main course I had beef stroganoff.  It was definitely the best version of this dish that I have eaten.  The hot tea was excellent, but my initial choice was not available and hadn't been for a bit according to the waitress.  If you are going to put your menu on a clipboard, can't you update it more frequently?\n\nAs at Rosemary's, my bottled water was kept on ice a stone's throw away from my table.  Here, however, they were on top of keeping it filled.  I still can't give this place 5 stars.  The service out of the main waitress was at best a 3.  Everything and everyone else was a 5.  I'd go back to grab some food and tea and relax.  I don't mind paying for a relaxing dining experience."

The crab cake appetizer was absolutely amazing... so good I ate mine and then my date's...\n\nThe seafood stew-ish entree I got (of which I do not recall the name) was amazing. The flavor was extremely fragrant and refreshing. The fish, shrimps, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari were fresh, juicy and the broth brought out their natural sweetness and complimented instead of overpowering.\n\nFor dessert, I had the trio of creme burlee, and wow... what a perfect finish to a great meal. I recall there was banana, vanilla beans, and original, three little cups of creamy goodness :) \n\nThe mojito was also very delicious, and I love the decor and the ambiance. What a refreshing change from the rest of the vegas scene."

It is nestled away in Summerlin and you'd never guess its there, hidden in the business park. Ambience is wonderful. The service is outstanding. But the food, my god the food. If you're in town visiting it is a drive- nowhere near the strip. But if you live in Vegas, head west. It's worth it. Oh and make sure you get Otash as your server. He is outstanding. \nPS: best tiramisu in the world. And I've been to Italy."

The restaurant and bar area were crowded but we were seated right away in their outdoor area, which was also quite full. The weather was gorgeous and the outside setting was very cute. Lots of white decor and the little lighted lanterns helped the ambience tremendously. Service was very good.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n(I'll upload some pics I took of the food)\n-prosecco\n-Moscow Mule\n-proscuitto flatbread\n-spring salad\n-intermezzo pasta course (a special that night) which was ricotta filled pasta pouches with black truffle shavings\n-lamb bolognese\n-lamb tagine\n\nEverything tasted so delicious! I love that the spring salad had a lot of components (beans, corn etc) so that it created different textures and flavors in each bite. The flatbread had a very nice crust, crispy yet chewy. The special intermezzo pasta course was very rich and flavorful. The outstanding dish for me was the lamb bolognese. The shreds of lamb were very tender and paired perfectly with the pasta.\n\nAs we had several boxes of left over food, needless to say we did not have room for dessert. I will definitely be coming back to Vintner."

I am generally looking for something a little more adventurous/creative when I dine at this price-range, but I'd come back to Vintner for a consistently good meal.\n\nI enjoyed the pumpkin gnocchi, the parsnip puree, and the halibut.

It was super crowded, they didn't have it together, and we avoided it ever since.\n\nWe finally decided to give it another try.  We didn't have reservations, which apparently are necessary.  But they do have bar tables which are first come, first served.  So that worked out well.\n\nService was horrendously slow.  This had a lot to do with the fact that the bar area was serviced by cocktail servers in tiny black dresses and impossible high heels.  These poor women could only move in tiny little steps.  I was seriously concerned for their safety.  Also, there were some single diners, who seemed to be regulars, who were getting a lot more attention.  We never got bread service, which kind of sucked.  Everyone else in the bar seemed to. The bussers took our bread plates away after the first course anyway. The servers and bussers seemed frazzled for some reason. Finally, the bar was slow as hell and just strange.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine.  We saw them getting poured into tiny carafes.  Then they sat on the bar for a few minutes.  Then one of the carafes got poured out into the sink.  Another carafe was filled.  Then the carafes sat on the bar again for a minute or two. Then finally the whole carafes were poured into glasses and served to us.  Huh? Our second glasses of wine did not go through this process.  So I don't know what the hell was going on.  And the bartenders need to realize that they aren't invisible.  Stop screwing around. Especially when we want our damn drinks. If they were trying to get the wine to breathe, that ain't gonna do it.  \n\nFood was hit or miss.  The highlights were the vegetable chopped salad and the black truffle salami on the carne menu.  The vegetable chopped salad was really unique with lots of tasty vegetables and a nice parmesan cheese.  The black truffle salami was so creamy and truffley.  Gotta track that sucker down at Whole Foods!  We also tried proscuitto and another salami which were just ok.  But it is nice that they offer a make-your-own characuterie plate option.  They offered a variety of cheeses, too.\n\nThe risotto was meh.  Not very flavorful.  And the lamb terrine was searing hot so it took a while to even be edible.  Once it cooled down, it was ok.  Nothing great.\n\nThe north side of the bar had video poker machines, which I don't recall seeing on my first visit here.  No one was playing and, from what I observed, the machines just annoyed the people who wanted to eat and drink.  Video poker kind of makes sense given that this is owned by the same group as the Roadrunner taverns.  It kind of ruins the ambience, though.  Then again, most of the furniture and decorations seems IKEAish to me.\n\nSomething I could try again, maybe with a reservation and servers wearing proper footwear, but I won't be chomping at the bit to come here either."

We started with bread service and everyone recommended the pretzel bread but I can never turn down olive bread so I went with that. \n\nI ordered the lunch portion of halibut and it was delicious. Superbly cooked and I could have easily devoured the full portion if I had ordered it. \n\nWhile I had attempted to eat relatively healthy for lunch, we decided to splurge for dessert and I couldn't say no trying all the options we ordered. We ordered the Turkish coffee cheesecake with pistachio gelato and honey, lemon & raspberry panna cotta and banana strudel. The cheesecake and panna cotta were the stars of the show. They were both so delicious and silky, I had to try my best to resist taking too many samples. \n\nOur lunch was great and the service lived up to our expectations as well. I look forward to coming back again soon for lunch and possibly to try their dinner options as well."

I got the flat-iron steak, absolutely tender. My wife got the chicken with a honey mustard glaze, very tender and the skin was cooked perfect. My mother in law got the halibut and the skin was cooked so it was crispy and the fish had so much flavor. I've never enjoyed white fish as much as the halibut here. \n\nThe atmosphere is of course sophisticated and classy while also being (intentionally) whimsical, as if to say \"hey we're fancy but we don't take ourselves too seriously\".

The design is simple with a gorgeous patio for outdoor dining and interior that boasts secluded booths with TVs playing old black and white motion pictures.\nWe arrived on a Thursday night assuming it would be pretty mellow. WRONG. It was some company's appreciation party so the place was pretty packed. We were able to snag a table without having reservations. I would strongly recommend reservations just to be on the safe side. We were seated and shortly after the server came by and took our drink order. We started off with a bottle of Fiji and I had their G&T and my husband one of their martinis. The cocktail prices range from $10-$15, but are masterfully prepared.\nWe started off with a 3 cheese plate and went solely based on our server's recommendations. We opted for a soft cheese, blue cheese, and a firm cheese selection. All of them were phenomenal. There is also a 5 cheese selection option for $25 if you'd like to sample more. The 3 cheese selection was plenty for the two of us to share. The platter is accompanied by warm brioche along with raisins and marmalade. \nI chose their roasted pepper with crab soup as my starter dish. The flavor was extremely unique, but once my taste buds adjusted I thought it was wonderful. It was creamy, rich, and had a generous portion of crab.\nI opted for the lamb bolognese as my entree, husband went with the Mediterranean Sea Bass with heirloom potatoes. I appreciated the bolognese, but found the flavor to be a little too rich for my personal taste. The lamb and ricotta combination just made it overpowering and quickly filled me up. The sea bass was perfectly cooked. It was flaky and flavorful. \nThe service was to the point, offering some great suggestions. Initially i thought the server appeared aloof, but I think he was just swamped. He was happy to help with our cheese selections, and our water was constantly refilled. Their pacing and scheduling was on point.\nI'd like to come back here for lunch and try the cobb salad that my husband keeps raving about.  Overall, I think this is a great date spot that's sure to impress."

The bread assortment is delicious once you get it, and that quailed us down a bit.  We ordered a nice French Burgundy to go with dinner.\nAppetizers:\nBurrata Insalata and the seared crab cakes- both very good.\nEntree:\nI had a seared fish which was perfectly executed, maybe halibut or branzino, can't recall.\nDessert consisted of a panna cotta and a trifle. Each one was excellent.\nOnce we got over the initial service hi cup, we did enjoy our meal at Vintner's.\nIf they could raise the service level a notch, they would be 4 stars. Still, I would return if the opportunity does arise."

Everything from the complimentary valet to the decor was warm and inviting. We started with the White Bean Hummus w/ Pita Chips. For our entrees we ordered the Roast Chicken, Crab Ravioli and Salmon. The food was exceptional!!! Our waitress was a bit blah but I would definitely return based on the food and atmosphere.\n\n-Ivan"

Since I am a new yelper, I figured I'd wait until my next visit to brag about how great this place is. A belated Fathers Day dinner seemed about right. \n\nIf I was talking to my wife, I would say that this place is \"fancy\" like that rap song you all listen to. It's a classy joint. The bar is well stocked, the seating comfortable, and there's always a cool jazz tune playing overhead. When you walk in there are two frosted panes of glass that appear to be for decoration. Time your dinner reservation right, and those panes of glass turn into an old timey black and white movie. A cool touch and great conversation piece if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThe menu is well stocked with some seemingly grill-esque favorites. You've got your steaks, your fish, your pasta dishes, etc. Everything is well done though. They also have a fresh menu what seems like weekly with new cocktails and drinks to try as well. I'm usually a beer guy, but ever since I've been going here, I've been hooked on the cocktails. Try the one with blackberries, mint, rum, and cane sugar. So I'm a guy drinking a fruity drink. What are you going to do about it? \n\nLast night I had the beef tenderloin with brie mashed potatoes and asparagus. The star of the dish (beyond the amazing piece of meat) is the reduction sauce poured around the steak. It has whole peppercorns and is addicting. When I asked if they could serve me a drink with this sauce, they laughed at me like I was joking. I wish I was. Anyway, the steak is cooked perfectly (I go medium rare +), and the potatoes were delicious. \n\nMy father in law ordered the same thing, and raved about it. My wife ordered the crab stuffed ravioli and loved it. Awesome that she took what she couldn't finish home so I could swipe one from the fridge (shhh). \n\nThe ambiance is great, the service is superb and obviously the food is top notch. It's just a little random that it's in what seemed like a condo parking lot. It's all good though. Just like a book, don't judge the place by the exterior, it's what's inside that counts."

I have to believe their success has been entirely word of mouth, and that should really say something as this place does not seem to be lacking in customers!\n\n5 star atmosphere\n3.5 star food\n3 star service\n=3.5 star review\n\nI had been dying to try out Vintner Grill after hearing raving reviews. I just needed a good excuse to get dressed up and go out for a nice dinner - so when I got a new job offer, I decided it was time to celebrate, and what better place?\n\nThe decor of VG is very fresh, mostly white. White floors, tables, table cloths, walls, etc. The ceiling is white wainscot, which gives the place almost a country club, or Newport California sort of feel. Inside they have TV's playing Black and White old movies which adds a sense of class to the place. There were a few people in jeans, but no one in a t-shirt, and most everyone was fairly well dressed.\n\nI love nothing more than wine, cheese and charcuterie so I was delighted to see a Formage and Carne menu with 3, 4 or 5 options. We opted for 5 selections ($25) and selected 3 cheeses and 2 meats. None of which were a let down. The cheese portions seemed small at first but went a long way with the accompanying bread and preserves! The best part of my meal here by far!\n\nThe menu had several wonderful sounding options - I had a hard time deciding on just one but went with the Halibut and Cous Cous because I hadn't had seafood in a while. I have to admit it was just ok... I was hoping to be blown away and I wasn't. The tomatoes were fresh and full of flavor, everything else was not. The lemon crust on the halibut left if feeling dry. I was disappointed, I will not be ordering that again. I don't recall the name of my date's meal, but it was some sort of shrimp pasta dish and he too said it was decent, but he too was wishing he'd order something else. Overall the food was good, but not great.\n\nOur waiter was the biggest let down. He was nice at first, but then seemed put off when my date asked for a recommendation for a nice \"cheap bottle of red wine\". He pointed out a $60 bottle and my date said, \"I was thinking a little cheaper.\" From this point on our waiter acted like we weren't worth his time. He rarely checked in on us, we once had to flag him down first to order our entrees and then again to ask for salt for the shrimp dish, and it was other staff who came by to refill our glasses of wine. I don't know what the average tab runs here, but all in all our bill was $130+ before tip so I felt we deserved a little better service experience.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere and the Formage and Cheese so much that I will give Vintner Grill another shot, and hope for better service. I would actually really love to try out what looks like wonderful patio seating, once spring is here."

The vibe at Vintner Grill is old glam Hollywood where white leather sofas, dark Old English bar, art deco chandeliers, and dimly lit candles meets crystal floor lamps. white linens, black and white classic movies and a wine list and menu featuring fabulous picks what more can I ask for?  Phew-I'm outa breath! Ambiance Ambiance! However, with that being said, it did lack some jazzy background music which would have been the perfect touch.\n\nI recommend you dress to impress and request a table in the main dining room so you get the whole experience and people watch.  We were tucked away near the cozy wine cellar where it was quiet but I did miss the table candle and some movie watching. There is some outdoor seating complete with fire-pit and twinkling lights too.  If you don't want a table the bar section is also a roomy option to sit and have dinner or a cocktail.\n\nOn this night we were out celebrating Kate's birthday so we started off with some refreshing libations that were featured on the menu. I chose my usual Lemon Drop Martini.  I always request it a bit more sweeter that sour. Pear martini, grapefruit vodka and a fresh ginger vodka concoction was served up in a copper mug for our party of four.\n\nThe menu changes a bit with the seasons and that's always a good thing. For starters we chose a fabulous Charcuterie.  The wonderful thing about this choice selection is that you pick out your favorite meats/cheeses/dried fruits/spreads.  Can you say Nom Nom Nom? Served up in a traditional wood board our selection of Lavender Goat Cheese, Manchego, Dried Salami, Prosciutto, Dates, Dried Apricots, Honey and Berry Jam and a basket of bread-BUT I do wish portions were a bit bigger and more bread was in the basket-BUT then I wouldn't have had room for our incredible Calamari Misto complete with battered lemon wedges and a yummy aioli dipping sauce. Everything was delicious. \n\nChoosing our entree for dinner was a hard choice because the surf and turf Mediterranean choices all sounded mouth-watering. Hmmm, Halibut? Sea Bass, Scallops? Butternut Squash Risotto? Salmon? Braised Short Rib Ravioli? Bouillabaisse? Decisions, Decisions! The food was all so elegantly served with so much love. I enjoyed every bite of my scallops and my hubby's ravioli.  MMMM.\n\nService was a bit on the super slow side but I don't like to feel rushed especially on a special occasion and your reservation here seems like its yours all night-because were here for about three hours drinking, eating, laughing, drinking, eating, laughing.  The nice thing was that I did see a few well-behaved children-so I'm always liking a place where you're not looked at cross-eyed for bringing in family.\n\nThe Sommelier helped to pick out a good wine and nice smooth Cabernet was delivered. Appropriate stemware was brought out too. Ginormous crystal wine glasses that allowed you to sniff, swirl and see the \"legs\" of the wine were much appreciated.\n\nDessert was not left out and we shared a fresh gourmet strawberry \"shortcake\" type of dessert which was delightful. A candle was placed on Kate's dessert so that was nice. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vintner-grill-las-vegas?userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#_4NDGgI_Y1ckFS1jz9v_tQ\n\nOverall a fun evening with friendly helpful staff. I will be telling all of my friends about this place and I do plan coming back."

We had wanted to try this place for a long time, and it certainly didn't disappoint! \n\nThe quality of food for the price is simply unbelievable.  The food was just as good as any place on the Strip, and much less expensive!  Here's the skinny:\n\nCOCKTAILS: Martinis were nicely made, and the blue cheese stuffed olives are TO DIE FOR. \n\nAPPETIZER: I'm not much of a \"fish\" fan (though I love sushi/shellfish), but the ahi tuna appetizer was ah-may-zing.  Very fresh, seasoned well, and I could've literally licked the plate clean.\n\nENTREES: We decided to split two entrees: the crab stuffed ravioli and the veal scallopini.  As another yelper stated, the crab-stuffed ravioli was generously stuffed with crab.  I think, of the two entrees, this was probably my favorite, though the veal scallopini was pretty excellent as well.  \n\nWINE LIST: Simply out of this world!  There were so many options; you can definitely tell their sommelier knows his stuff.  There are options for smaller budgets, up to really large budgets.  We had a prosecco which was rather moderately priced, and it was delicious.  \n\nDECOR: Old Hollywood glam.  Reminds me of the Cosmo's decor in a lot of ways.  I loved the sleek white feel.\n\nSERVICE: The service here has gotten some lackluster reviews.  Our service was great; the server was extremely attentive.  We weren't rushed in any way, and every time we needed something, he was right there to help.\n\nThe one complaint - which is why I gave this place four stars - is that other than a \"Happy Anniversary\" as we were leaving the place, our special occasion wasn't even acknowledged."

Being a Friday night and beautiful out, I thought it might be crowded but when I got there it was a nice crowd and not overly busy. \n\nI was quickly greeted when I walked in the door and found my date. We were seated in a corner and our server promptly arrived to ask for our choice of flat or sparkling water. As we settled in I noticed that Casablanca was playing on a screen in the middle of the room and the ambiance was contemporary yet very comfortable. \n\nOur server was friendly, knowledgeable, and over all a great server. We took our time with our meal as we wanted to chat and visit but it never seemed to phase the server and he knew how to let us have time while still keeping the dinner moving along. We started off with wine and a cheeseboard. Both being pretty open to most foods, we just let the server pick the cheese and were happy with everything he brought. \n\nAs with what is their staple, while we waited for our appetizer another person came around and offered us a selection of breads from his tray. We took a few selections and enjoyed the accompanying honey and butter. I can say that my low carb lifestyle was killed this night but I wasn't upset. \n\nAfter we finished off the first bottle and were well into our second we decided that after all the cheese and bread we'd just share the salmon tandori entree. Once again we were quite pleased with the food and service. \n\nThis was definitely a great experience and I can't wait until I go back to try more of their selections. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal, great service, and great atmosphere."

That feeling was quickly quashed as soon as I saw the video poker machines embedded into a portion of the bar. Never can seem to escape the gambling!!\n\nThe setting has a South Beach feel to it, removing you from the fact that you're in an office Park. Sitting at the bar you can very well see there was some thought put into the space. There is a beautiful outdoor space with a lounge type of feel. A private dining area with a beautiful wine display, and comfortable banquet seating with pillows. I'm a sucker for a place that plays black & white movies on the tv screen too. It's tablecloth dining with sharp dressed waiter and bartenders. And an nice open kitchen to let you peak into the heart of the cooking. Sounds nice right?\n\nBut then the disaster started. Service was so disappointing. They sat us at a table right next to the server computer station, why would you even have a table there in the first place? We made the best of it, there were pillows so I thought-can't be that bad?! \n\nWell it was. I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus but its easy to see this place lacks any management. I don't think I could even see one around. Water was poured into our old iced tea glass and throughout the dining experience glasses were left empty right until we got the bill. I requested water without ice and repeatedly had ice in my glass. Mistakes happen yes, but then the waiter berated the busboy so close to our table. It made us feel so uncomfortable.\n\nPositive: The food! Portions are manageable and priced well. The meat is cooked to the perfect temprature and all the fixings were seasoned so well. They have a pleasant winelist with familiar choices and I feel all the prices are relflective to the setting. I think it makes a great date spot. Just make them seat you far away from the waiter's computer station.\n\nI'm not inclined to return anytime soon as the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. But I would have to say its worth a look-see for anyone venturing to this part of Summerlin and looking for a nice setting to dine in with well executed cuisine. Hopefully service will be better for you!"

Also had prosciutto wrapped Ceasar. Also very good. Wife had half chicken and I had the new York. Both prepared perfectly. My only complaint was the size of the drinks. Small buckets for a big bucket price. Wife told me they have poker machines at the bar. Can't wait to go back."

This place really delivered and I'd venture to say on a Monday it's one of the best lunches one can buy in the Summerlin area. \n\nWe wanted to try a couple of things and decided on the steak cobb salad and the chicken. I've eaten a ton of cobb salads (having done low carb on and off for nearly a year now!), and this is my pick for the best one in Las Vegas. They split it up for us without even asking, and my half portion was very substatial. Warm delicious steak. Asparagus. Fresh soft bleu cheese crumbles. Ever so lightly dressed. YUM. This is what the salad on the lunch menu at Simon is trying to be - exact at Simon they charge you $5 more for it, give you half as much food, and serve you sad little steak crumbles that are cold and dry. I love it when a place promises steak on a salad and delivers WARM steak. So important!!\n\nWe split the chicken for our main course. It was so delicious! Light honey flavor on the skin, and moist amazing chicken. I'm not the world's biggest chicken fan, but this won me over!! It was served with broccolini and what my coworked called \"spetzel mac and cheese\". So delicious!! \n\nThe atmosphere is light and airy and beautiful. Great for everything from a ladies lunch to a birthday lunch to a power lunch. Service was awesome. We were in and out of there in 45 minutes (even with 2 courses!) - so important on a lunch break. Our bill was around $22 a person with tax/tip - more than worth it for the quality of the experience."

Our service was impeccable from the time we walked in  the door. For apps, we had the hummus, a must for the vegetarian at the table, the crab cakes and the calamari.  For an entree, I had the mushroom  risotto.  The server suggested it as a side but there is plenty to eat as a meal. It was wonderful! By the way, they make an amazing raspberry Arnold Palmer.  We were so full, we could not indulge the desserts, so save room because it looked amazing!  The next time, I am in Vegas, I am going to skip all the chef named restaurants on the Strip and head further out to the suburbs (9 miles) for fine dining, a relaxing atmosphere and no sounds of slot machines outside the door. \n\nNote: It is located in a office area, so look for the big \"V\" sign off the road on the right and then turn right at the next street and then another right and drive through the parking lot to the back area for the entrance. ( of course the locals want to keep this gem a secret!)"

However, it was an amazing hour well spent because we got to try all the DELICIOUS drinks the bartenders made and enjoyed the beautiful scenery outside. I LOVED the whole romantic ambiance set up, with the numerous lanterns hanging from the branches and christmas lights strung all around. It really felt like I was in a fairy tale and I was getting happier every minute with each sip of deliciously-made martinis that I was drinking ;)\n\nAnd then to go on to the FOOD....... My mouth is already salivating thinking about the yumminess that was brought out by our very friendly waitress. I remember falling in love with the butternut squash ravioli, braised lamb, and even the bread they brought out! Every single bread in the basket was unique and delicious, just like a box of chocolates! :D For the main entree, I ordered the bouillabaisse, which was filled with fresh seafood and the broth was super flavorful. \n\nI loved loved this place. If I could give you an extra star, I definitely would! I noticed it definitely got crowded around dinner time, so I recommend making a reservation!"

I first spotted the outside patio area, it was very Miami, white curtains flowing, comfy patio furniture, there was a wedding party there and it looked so fashionable, like out of a magazine. The inside decor was a mixture of contemporary/modern Pottery Barn-esque with a splash of beach feel, I liked the little nooks built into the wall, it was like just a little bit of Morocco thrown in as well. Ok onto the food, the first time I went there I did a cheese board and some wine, they have a great cheese selection and I really enjoyed my order. Second time I had split 2 entrees with my friend so we could try both, we ordered the halibut with cous cous, spinach, toasted orzo, lemon gremolata and sweet tomatoes, I politely asked if they could hold the butter, and the server was very nice, didn't give me a hard time, this dish was wonderful, halibut was cooked to perfection, definitely recommend, the show stopper though was the bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth. This was so delicious, comparable to cioppino, but the saffron broth gave it a different twist. The calamari was outstanding. Service was outstanding, our server was very attentive, my water glass was never empty, they continually came around to give you more bread, oh the bread....awesome bread basket....carb addicts dream. The is a place I wouldn't hesitate to take out of towners or recommend to locals."

The dining room was filled with a diverse crowd and all seemed to be happy with the elegant dishes being presented and the expanded wine and signature drinks being poured.\n\nEach time I come here with a new guest, the same reaction is witnessed...\"Wow!\"  And Vintner continues to impress as the wait staff offers their assortment of dinner rolls and oil/butter and the main waiter welcomes you by informing you of the specials of the evening.  \n\nOur particular waiter was Greg who had only been with VG for a year yet his knowledge of the menu, executive Chef's bio, wine pairing recommendations  and history of the restaurant would make you think he  enjoyed senior status.  Greg constantly checked on us without being over bearing and ensured our cocktails/wine were always filled. \n\nWhile some of the seating arrangements appeared to be close to one another, the conversation you have with your guest weren't interrupted with neighboring guests.\n\nThere are so many items to select off the menu and each is delicious depending on what you happen to be in the mood for. I have enjoyed the halibut, the free-range chicken, the prime beef tenderloin and the lobster cannelloni on various visits and I look forward to expanding my cravings to the other items featured.\n\nThe price you pay for an incredible evening here is substantially less than a place on The Strip, and the service is so far above most dining establishments.\n\nIf you want to impress your guest or just pamper yourself with food, drink and attentive service then visit Vintner Grill....and often!"

We asked the waiter why it wasn't served in a brandy glass (this happened twice by the way). The first time the waiter said that they are very fragile glasses and most are broken, and the ones that weren't broken were being used. The second time the waiter told us that the glasses were expensive, most had been broken, and the owner didn't want to buy more of them. These two times were the last two times we've been, and I'm very dissapointed. It's a simple thing - BUY SOME BRANDY GLASSES PLEASE. This seems like a small thing to comment on, but it is just so out of the ordinary for what we expect when going to Vintner Grill."

Then the bread guy stopped by with a half dozen to choose from- We had Olive Bread, pretzel bread, bacon cranberry and brioche- we had seconds!! \n\nEric ordered the Halibut- moist and tender.

The purple haze was my favorite, absolutely delicious. My boyfriend chose a flatbread for his entree, and I had the honey-mustard glazed half chicken with the \"mac and cheese.\" His flatbread was bigger than expected and he said it was delicious. My favorite food on the planet is mac and cheese, and theirs was great, but the chicken blew the mac out of the water. It practically melted in my mouth. Beyond fantastic. We ordered a salad to share in between our appetizer and entree, but it somehow got forgotten in the shuffle. We weren't worried about it since what we ordered was more than enough. However, our server was so apologetic for mistake he threw in a tiramisu for us to take home with our leftovers to make up for it. My only complaint would be that its a long dining experience, so don't come here if you are tight on time.

My husband and I had an excellent dinner here for our anniversary. \n\nWe had no problem getting a table with a 6:00 reservation. We started with drinks, a blackberry mix drink for my husband and a flight of wine for me. I liked that I was able to get a flight of wine that had two whites and two reds for variety. Then the bread basket arrived and I wished I had room to try everything. The green olive bread was my favorite of the two I did try.\n\nThe cheese selection is very impressive so we had to get a cheese board. Since my husband is a picky eater we just went with asiago, smoked cheddar, and chorizo as our options. Wow, far from boring. Everything was delicious and they serve some other fun items with the cheeses that were really good. This is the point at which my husband declared Vintner a winner and said we didn't need anything else.\n\nIt only got better when the entrees arrived. Both of our meals were out of this world. I had the crab ravioli which had great flavor and the portion was perfect. My husband had the scallops with corn risotto. The whole dish was bursting with amazing flavors. Everything was cooked to perfection. \n\nAt this point we knew we had to have dessert. So, we wrapped up with the lemon meyer cheesecake. I'm not usually a cheesecake fan, but the lemon gave the cheesecake a nice flavor. The berry topping and whipped cream were delicious as well.\n\nWe have already decided that we need to make the trip across town for this restaurant again. I can't wait to go back!"

The NY steak was excellent, perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavor and melting butter on top.  The crushed Yukon Gold potatoes were great and I appreciate our waitress telling me how good they were when I tried to sub them out. My daughter enjoyed her Dungeoness Crab Ravioli and some of my steak.  The portions were large and the main course price was high but not outrageous.

We ordered a cheese platter right away and I love the cheese options including the vintner grill made cheeses. However, the tray arrived with the smallest slices of cheese I have ever seen and only three small slices of crustini.  We didn't even see a waitress to ask for more of the bread.  While we are on the subject of the bread, I remember last year having a large board of different breads brought out to the table to select from. Included on the board was a pretzel bread.  While waiting for our table I saw many diners enjoying the pretzel bread and was looking forward to it.  When we finally got to order at 8:00 and the bread still hadn't arrived we asked and the waitress brought us a small basket of raisin and nut breads.  When we inquired about the pretzel bread we were told they sold out a while ago (not true since people still were enjoying them at their table within plain view.) Now, I understand economics of restaurants and you can't always anticipate the demand and you have to err on the side of ordering or making too little rather than too many but really, Vintner Grill has been around long enough to know how many to make for Saturday night esepecially when they had a wedding taking up half the room.  And they weren't even at full capacity.\n\nI do like the butter which comes spread around a ramikin with two wells each containing a different herb or spice to flavor the butter.\n\nAfter the waitress made several minor but annoying errors on our drinks and appetizer orders, everyhthing settled in.  The wait for our food was very long and we were forced to listen to the longest best man toast at a wedding reception ever.  Even the guests looked bored to tears and the waiter with the cake was waiting over 10 minutes for him to finish.\n\nI still love this place but I seriously recommend going midweek when it will be less crowded and you can get 1000 point tables on opentable.  Saturdays they usually only give 100 points.\n\nIf anyone from Vintner reads this, my tip is give slightly more cheese and bread to put it on, have more pretzel bread, and give us a different waitress when we return next time.\n\nAs an aside, Andre Aggasi was there and is a frequent guest. We didn't talk to him because we didn't know he was there until the end but he does have a nice car!  Other celbs also dine here so have your cell phones ready if you are a celeb stalker."

The hostess was professional and very fast to seat us for our reservation. The waiter was prompt with service in the beginning but then kind of disappeared for long periods in between meals. When bringing out the soup for the appetizer they forgot the key necessity which was the spoon and then it took a few minutes just to get a hold of someone to bring us one. The waiter continued to disappear for minutes again and we found ourselves looking at empty plates at our table. The food was good; nose level was acceptable; the desserts were Ok."

There is something special about the indoor and outdoor patio sitting with fresh garden aroma wafting on top of freshly prepared dishes. \n\nThere is a $25 power lunch menu, including choice of starter, entree and dessert...but I am not much a dessert person,especially for lunch, so I stick to my a la cart with glass of vino from their rather attractive selections on their wine menu. They also offer a half-size wine option, which is still plenty for lunch....leaving room to try a yummy soup or salad. One of my favorites at VG is their seasonal soup selection. Today I had \"fire roasted red pepper soup with smoked chicken\".....this flavor is already welcoming Autumn to my palate....a half size order was plenty to indulge in before the entree.\n\nI have my go-to waiter or waitress at any restaurant I regularly dine at....they can help elevate the experience to another level by providing exceptional service time and time again....and at Vintners Grill, I have Ray....always welcoming and ready with the perfect recommendations."

The best part for me was the ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant itself. It was like being on the strip without being in a casino. It's really cool.  The only thing is that it has the snooty Summerlin vibe to it.  As for the food, the only stand out items to me were the wine and cheese. Everything else on the menu was pretty standard including their \"specials\" that are existing items on their menus.  For the bad. Well you guessed it, the SERVICE.  From the hostess to server. And we spent over $500 for dinner?!  In fairness, we went on a Friday night.  Then again, if you're going to charge $33 for a pork chop, then step up. Our waiter actually snapped at us when we asked him if we could order dinner. And this was after we had patiently waited for 30 minutes. Really? Even the staff have snooty attitudes?  So in conclusion, it wasn't the best or worst. I'd be willing to go again if I was forced (like a group dinner). But didn't make my \"can't wait to go again list\""

I felt like a wedding crasher so we were going to leave and come back some other time. When we told the hostess that we were going to come back when they weren't so busy she assured us that she will have us seated in a few moments. I thought she was really nice because a lot of places would be like \"okay bye\"! We started the meal with the white bean hummus with olive relish and spicy pita chips. I'm usually critical when it comes to hummus because I was brought up on it. This past my test because it had enough \"zing \" in it for me . I think they should serve this with more pita chips though. The olive relish was good because it had just the right amount of salt in it. I also had the crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli. I really liked the sauce ...I ate almost all the Calamari. I left the ones that looked like mini Octopus behind...I know what I'm eating but I just don't want to be reminded of it. My crab ravioli with fresh English peas, crimini was good. I liked the sweetness of the crab.. it doesn't look like a big portion but it is filling. I had to take the other half home. My husband had the mesquite grilled new york with tarragon-mustard butter, crushed yukon gold potatoes, and port reduction. I tried some of his dish and it was delicious I kind of wish I ordered that instead. Even though the meat was well done it was still nice and tender. The potatoes went perfect with the meal. I paired my meal with a Pear Martini it was yummy! I'm glad I asked the waiter's opinion on drinks because I would have ordered the Black Dragon (like a blueberry Mojito). I told him I preferred my drinks to taste like candy so he made sure they made it extra sweet. My husband had the Black Dragon he didn't like it though. We ended our meal with a Banana Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie which was really decadent and worth every bite! The service was great and I liked the eclectic choices of food. I would love to come back when it's not hotter than Hades and dine it one of their tents outside!"

The decor on the show looked amazing, and it did not disappoint in person. Really beautiful interior as well as patio. That is what the 3 stars are for..everything else was a big disappointment. We asked to be seated outside, and the hostess led us to a table that was completely in the dark..no candle, no nothing...I don't normally pay $25 for an entree that I can't even see. We asked to be moved to a different table and waited a few minutes while they set it up. Little bit better, but still needed a flashlight in order to read the menu. My husband and I shared a 3 cheese plate & Moroccan spare ribs to start...both were just average..nothing special. While we were still eating the cheese plate, the food runner brought out our main courses..seriously?? We had them sent back to the kitchen, but then started to worry that they would just be sitting under a heat lamp, so we asked that they be brought out again. Our server did let us know that the entrees were being remade, and that did appear to be true when they were eventually brought back out again.  That helped the situation a bit, but no apologies were ever made about the terrible timing. My husband had the scallops with risotto and I had the crab ravioli...we both enjoyed the scallops, but the crab ravioli was very average...what was really irritating about this dish was that it was featured on the Rachael Ray show and it had crab meat on top as well as inside the ravioli...not on mine, however. Ugh. If you are going to feature a dish, shouldn't you try to make it the same every time, not just when it's shown on tv?? All in all, decor is fabulous, food ok, and service terrible. I would maybe go here again for a drink, but that's about it."

My wife's salad wasn't even seasoned, unfortunately there was no salt or pepper on the table to use. When the bread service came around after receiving the appetizers we were both disappointed in picking up bread that felt like it just came out of cold storage. Unfortunately it doesn't get  much better, the Sea Bass that I ordered was very dry, the fish skin was crispy black which doesn't taste very good. Too me the crispy( not burnt) skin is the best part of the fish. The vegetables were a mixed bag of yes and no. The tomatoes were hot and tasty, the potatoes were barely warm and needed some seasoning. The sauce was interesting with a nice warm spice mix. Green beans could've been hot as well. Did I eat the food? Yes, every bit of it , because I was starving and worked all freaking day, and so did my wife! No I didnt complain at all, it was Christmas, but I should've.

The restaurant was LOUD. Not loud with music, rather conversation. Since much of the restaurant is fitted in wood, the sound really carries; Vintner Grill is not a great date spot, though it does suit groups very well. It resembles many innocuous bistros you might find on the streets of Chicago, Manhattan, or any other large metropolitan area. \n\n\nTHE FOOD: \nI was a bit let down by the food. Vintner Grill is generally received well by guests, and came highly regarded to me by a coworker. \n\nI had a few selections from the cheese and Charcuterie menu which were good. The Petit Basque is a deliciously balanced, semi-soft cheese I highly recommend. \n\nI also had the calamari with a curried aioli, the Moroccan spiced lamb spareribs, and the honey truffled half-chicken. The calamari was flash fried, but a little too flashy. It was undercooked, and chewy. Calamari is a super easy dish to cook; it was disheartening to have such bad calamari at what some would call a fine dining establishment. The spare ribs were perfectly charred on the outside and seasoned well. Be aware that lamb spare ribs are a fatty cut before ordering. This is a good thing for people in the know. \n\nThe chicken was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! The skin was perfectly crispy without being overcooked. The meat was succulent and tender, but the flavor is what makes this literally THE BEST CHICKEN I HAVE EVER EATEN. The flavors married to form a symphony of pleasure. This chicken will put a smile on your face once the first nuance of flavor is detected by your taste buds. \n\nI can't agree with most reviewers on Vintner Grill, but I can tell you that the 1/2 chicken is a 5 Star dish, and reason enough to give this spot a go."

I was a bit concerned, as several yelpers had commented on the poor service.  I have to agree with them.  Although we were seated promptly, we had to wait a good while before a server came with a drink menu.  We then had to wait a good while to get our bottle of wine.  Although everyone was friendly, it's like they needed a few more servers on the floor.\n\nWe got a 5 piece charcuterie plate to start.  The 10 year aged cheddar was great, but only had 2 small pieces.  Our table had 4 people, and it was not enough for everyone to really get a good taste.  Some other cheeses (the blue for example) came with a lot more on the plate.  I understand that different cheeses have different prices, but I would have appreciated it had the server told us this cheddar is a small serving, so we could have ordered more or another selection.\n\nI had the porterhouses, which was okay, not great.  The star of the show in my estimation was the chicken and mac n cheese that one in our party had.  \n\nI will say the wine list was reasonable and diverse.\n\nI will not return unless someone else is paying.

I'm not a fan of valet parking, but I get it, it's Summerlin. You don't have to valet, just be prepared to walk 100 feet to the entrance. \n\nVG has solid menu options ranging from pasta to filet and even octopus. They're open for lunch M-F & dinner every day. The cocktail and wine menus have been changing regularly and that is a plus. Their popular cocktail offerings vary from a blueberry crush to a champagne cocktail. The variety of wines is extensive, so they live up to their name. I can usually find something new to try even after being here too many times to remember. \n\nI recommend trying their cheese & meat boards (known to some as charcuterie). I've tried the boar salami and smoked duck with Stilton blue cheese. Tasty! They also have some pizza (flatbread) options such as Italian sausage with burrata cheese. Thursday has been live music night and the place can be quite busy for that. \n\nThe patio is nice, with a firepit to add ambiance. They have gaming (smoke free) at the bar and this is my favorite place to play video poker. One downside to gaming here is no player's club. Another is they close long before midnight, so no late night gaming here! The benefit is top notch beverages with no worry about having smoke in your face at any time."

Thursday nights are a little more upbeat as they have a DJ playing music. It is hidden in a business park but they offer valet parking. The wait staff is excellent. Very friendly. Will be back on my visits to Vegas."

That being said, it falls short on several levels.  Went with a couple of friends and we all tried each other's dishes.  We had skirt steak, bouillabaisse and veal scallopine.  All the dishes were ok.  The steak was cooked properly but could have used a chimi churi or something to brighten it up.  The bouillabaisse was too safroni.  It made it taste a little soapy.  The veal was tender and the sauce flavorful.  We also shared dessert but I can't remember what it was.  Service was good although a bit pretentious."

Coffee was made in a French press which gave you about 2.5 cups to sip on.  Our helpful server was very busy when we were ready for the check, but we didn't mind waiting and sipping the last of the coffee. VG is a very comfortable place.  I'd recommend it to anyone."

We ordered the crab cake, lettuce wrap and the tomato heirloom salad for appetizers. All 3 were delicious, made with fresh ingredients and beautifully presented. For our entrees, we got the Lamb Bolganese and the goat cheese flatbread. The flat bread was just ok, but the Lamb Bolganese was absolutely delicious! The lamb was seasoned well, and cooked just right. For dessert, we got the apple upsidedown cake which was ok, and the house made pistachio gelato. \n\nService was very attentive, and to be expected at such a high end restaurant. The whole restaurant feels very clean but contemporary. Bathrooms are very clean and nice. Parking is super easy."

The decor is REALLY impressive (especially for an office park). Prices were a little cheaper than expected which was appreciated. \n\nI do have to say that the service was exeptional though, our drinks were always refilled and we never noticed anyone do it.

I decided to give the place a try with its Restaurant Week menu and I was not disappointed.\n\nCourse 1 was crispy calamari with a lemon and curry aioli and some haricot verts.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I liked that besides rings they had tentacles mixed in.  The lemon and curry aioli was a very tasty dipping sauce.  5/5\n\nCourse 2 was veal scaloppini with crimini mushrooms, lemon, marsala and capellini with olive oil.  The marsala sauce was superb in its richness and the crimini mushrooms added god flavor.  The capellini was a bit bland.  It needed some salt and for my taste a bit of grated cheese to bring out the richness of the olive oil.  4.5/5\n\nCourse 3 was a dessert of a gorgonzola panna cotta with a cherry compote and some sesame tuile.  The panna cotta was very light as it should be and had a mild flavor.  The cherry compote paired well with the lightness of the panna cotta.  The tuile was placed across the plate in the panna cotta.  Presentation was quite nice.\n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated.  I appreciate the fact that they start dinner service at 4.  I had a reservation for 4:30 as I needed to eat, run home and put my shorts back on, and head to a play at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.  Service was excellent.  My server was polite and efficient.  The music loop was more for gray hairs like me.  The place was quiet, but it was early and there weren't many diners yet.  I do wish we could dispense with the TVs at the bar, but this is Las Vegas and almost any bar needs one or more TVs."

The restaurant is a little off the road, but it was so worth looking for! It was so romantic! We were seated on the bench with nice decorative pillows and in front of big flat screen TVs. We  watched romantic old movies while dining. We shared a wonderful bottle of chardonnay, and then were presented with a scrumptious bread selection. I always judge the restaurant by its bread. This bread bucket was out of this world - olive bread, white chocolate bread, cranberry pecan bread. So flavourful, so fresh, so delicious! Excellent! Then we ordered a Caesar salad for sharing, and they split it for us and served it on two plates elegantly presented. Then we had fresh fish for main course and it was excellent. Superb. We ended our meal with maple creme brulee - I never tasted a cream brulee that tasted this good.  This restaurant is one of the very best restaurants in Las Vegas area and I bet in the whole state of Nevada. Kudos, Vintner Grill! You made our night very special. We highly recommend."

Now, my friend takes forever to get ready and never can get anywhere on time- I think her moving around the reservations TWICE cuz she's not done with her hours long grooming ritual made the hostess upset. When we got there, the original was for outside and I was not feeling well so we were trying to sit inside instead. Hostess was definitely not friendly when she told us no. Given its probably annoying that we moved our reservation, but still you don't need to look so gravely annoyed. \n\nSo outside we went and I just hope for the best out of dinner. Thankfully it started to cool down as we sat there but I still had to go to the bathroom and make a cold compress.  Bread basket is good, but wtf is up with cold, just taken out of the fridge bread? They had a loaf that I loved, cranberry and bacon, but they really should ask people if they want it or not. We had someone in our table that cannot eat pork- a Muslim and also a vegetarian and they both bit into it thinking it's just cranberries and had to spit it out. (More for me!!) There was also a pretzel roll and a few slices of different wheat, sour, etc with two kinds of seasoned butter with a bit of oil on top: herb& oil and chili flakes&oil.\n\nMy friend grabbed some calamari for the table. It came with a few fried green beans and fried lemon slices (eat them- its actually good and not too tart) with a creamy curry sauce. The calamari was fresh though I would like more seasoning in the batter, it needed sauce. Maybe I'm just setting myself up to be disappointed since I love/crave the calamari at Herbs&Rye that is so flavor packed. \n\nBF and I wanted to share two things- a lamb bolognese tagliatelle with truffled riccota and a crab ravioli with cream sauce, peas, grape tomatoes and crimini mushrooms. Bolognese was very rich, but delicious. Definitely glad we chose to share so it can break up the flavor. I would normally love this thoroughly, but I'm sick (throat&ear infection, severe congestion, fever and nausea caused by the ear infection) so I needed something to lighten it. The flavorings and the use of pieces of lamb shank reminds me of osso bucco or a lamb tagine so great for fans of those dishes. The crab ravioli was generously stuffed with crab and was very fresh. we loved the combo of the flavors of this- good balance of some sweetness from a wine base and peas, some creaminess, richness of crimini and some fresh flavors with the herbs and fresh cut cherry tomatoes. My friend had a Mediterranean sea bass with a mix of squash and other veggies and her BF had skirt steak with sweet potato fries. They seemed to be very satisfied with their meal. We skipped dessert since we needed to drop them off to the strip, but looked good. \n\nIt was rather busy as our dinner went on. Service was okay, but not very attentive....we had to wait a while for a refill and sat a while to be noticed that our plates are done and we need the check.  We weren't neglected, but it wasn't the best. To me, it seemed that the guy was so busy though seeing him bustling about so maybe it means the establishment is spreading their staff too thin by giving them too many tables. \n\nOverall, we had a satisfying meal. I don't know if I'd come often because of the dinner prices isn't the most affordable to someone with piles of bills, but I think it's more of a place I'd come for drinks&appetizers or lunch. I do enjoy the atmosphere and maybe coming earlier would be a quieter, more attentive experience."

However, when we pay those prices, we don't expect to be seated next to screaming children. If we wanted to eat with screaming children, we would have gone to a fast food restaurant. People with small children need to hire a babysitter, especially on a Saturday night. If they can afford to eat at VG, they can afford to hire a babysitter. VG also needs to be aware of this issue and tactfully tell customers with small children that they cannot accommodate them. I'm sorry, this may sound heartless, but that's the way we feel.\n\nIn other areas, the food was good, no doubt about that. The ambience was a bit noisy (aside from the screaming children), no doubt due to the fact that the floors are not carpeted. I'm sure carpeting would absorb a lot of the noise. We've gone to many other restaurants at this price point and never experienced the noise level we did last night. Of course, in all fairness, it was a Saturday night. In addition, the tables are very close together causing both the staff and other patrons to unavoidably jostle my husband.\n\nOn the plus side (yes, there was a plus side), the food was very tasty and well presented. The service was adequate although we've had better service at other restaurants.\n\nAll in all, we'll have to think long and hard about returning to VG despite its \"awesome\" reputation in Summerlin."

It has a secret feel because it is a bit difficult to find, but just go into the corner on the left in the parking lot and you will see it. Such an unusual gem to see in Summerlin; there were checkered floors and an old movie playing from a projector. Definitely a chic atmosphere and a variety of meals (basic starters, wood-fired flatbreads, pasta&risotto, entrees, prime wood-grill).  \n\nFood was delicious, but more importantly: they claim to have one of the largest selections of cheeses in Las Vegas. Along with hand-selected and house cured meats. Need I say more? *wiping drool off* Since it's not \"acceptable\" to bathe in a tub of cheese, this might be the next best thing. Order a bunch of fancy smelly cheese that will make you feel like you're in France. Since I was with a party of people I tried an assortment of dishes, all being flavorful. \n\nThe only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the service was slow and they took a long time to accommodate extra people that joined, despite it being a quick and easy fix.  \n\nGood news for those farther from Summerlin, they opened one on the Strip! They are also open for lunch."

What a find in an office park.\n\nWe asked the server (Paige) to make our 5-cheese selections for us and she delivered.  Goat cheese, blue cheeses, and two salamis.  I am  not even sure what they  were but they were great.\n\nTried the Italian sausage and burrata flatbread pizza and the scallops.  The pizza was super tasty but the crust could have been a little crisper.  The scallops were well seasoned, maybe a little salty, but were slightly more undercooked than I would have liked.  Still great, but not absolutely perfect.  I would definitely here again.  It was great!"

We stopped by for drinks and CHEESE only this time, so we sat at the bar.  The Moscow Mule served in the traditional copper cup was tasty.  The cheese and meat selection is beyond amazing.  The female at the door needs a reality check as she is only a hostess.  Maybe she is a millennial and doesn't know any better but her attitude sucks.  Her job is to smile and make me feel welcome not like an inconvenience.  The female bartender was extremely friendly and made us a few unique cocktails that were very good.  I did find it odd that during our conversations she mentioned that even with bad service its common to tip 25%.  Was this a subtle hint?   Oh and next time don't try and convince me that the Affordable Care Act is a good thing let alone how happy you would be with an increase in minimum wage.  Politics and drinking don't mix:)  We will be back soon as the food, drink and ambiance are second to none."

            "review": "Located in an inconspicuous office park in Summerlin, Vintner Grill has been a favorite dinner spot of mine for a few years now. Looking at the address and being familiar with most restaurant locations in Vegas off of the strip, one would assume the entrance is facing directly onto Charleston Blvd, but you would be mistaken. Once you finally locate the entry amongst your standard setup of covered office parking spaces in the back, you enter a space rich with modern design and accessories. It might be a tad cluttered, but I really like the space and have always loved everything I've eaten for dinner. This is the first time I've been there for lunch, and jumped on the chance when I saw a burger on the menu. But did it stand up as well as the dinners I've eaten?\n\nThe short answer is no. As I said I've really never had any complaints about anything I've had for dinner, but I found several things wrong with this burger. First off, the bun to meat ratio was a bit too high, just more bun than I needed. It didn't help that it was quite dry and really distracted me from the meat...which in turn is a good thing, because even though I ordered it medium-rare as I always do, it was way over cooked. The burger was still surprisingly juicy even with it being more cooked than I'd like, yet by the time I got to the last few bites it was very dry. Overall the meat had little flavor to it, but the char flavor it did have on the outside was quite good. The bacon had a really great smoky flavor, and was cooked properly to have a nice crunch to it. The 'homemade' pickles also had great flavor, but were a bit lost in this burger.\n\nThe fries were another disappointment. Typically everything included with my meals at Vintner down to the sides are always great, yet these fries had very little flavor and just seemed a bit too uninspired. I would have expected a black truffle touch or something to them, but no such luck.\n\nOverall the burger did have good flavor, but the dry bun and boring fries didn't help the overall experience too much. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend going here for the burger, I would definitely recommend Vintner Grill any time as a great date spot or just to have a nice dinner."

Both inside the restaurant and the outdoor seating looked very nice, but since it was a nice day we sat outside. I loved sitting on the couch area with lots of pillows. Our waiter was very nice and patient with us (we were very indecisive with our food!) and gave us good recommendations when we asked. \n\nI tried the chicken dish and it was probably the best chicken ever! It was so tasty and fell apart so easily so it was easy to pickup. There was also some sort of macaroni and cheese sorta dish, which was okay. I wasn't too crazy about the macaroni and cheese though the chicken changed my life! After our lunch, we had three cheeses which were extremely yummy as well.\n\nOverall, the service was great (I never had an empty glass), the food was amazing (everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and had leftovers to bring home), and ambiance was relaxing. I definitely would like to return on my next trip back to Vegas. \n\nOh, and the women's bathrooms were very clean as well!!!"

We live in the SF Bay area and went to Vegas for the weekend my husband stayed a few days longer for business.  The hotel (Red Rock) concierge recommended this restaurant and it was nearby. The setting is very nice and we were seated promptly.  I had a Moscow Mule and my husband had a glass of red wine.  We tried  to get some assistance with the cheese and meat choices but the waiter seemed too busy to help (I had read that this was one of their specialties)  So my husband and I each settled on a salad that came with brie.  A bus boy came around with a platter of bread choices and a butter/olive oil combo for dipping/spreading.\nI ordered the Vegan Portobello mushroom with spaghetti squash and loved it!  My husband had a flatbread (pizza anywhere else) that he enjoyed.\nWe were too full for dessert.  \nOur waiter was nice but not very friendly when we first arrived.  He didn't help or make suggestions for the cheese and meat when we ordered our drinks but he seemed to be nicer as the dinner progressed so maybe he was just too busy when we first arrived.  So 4 star instead of 5.  When a diner is looking for guidance with the menu it is worth taking the extra few minutes to help them.  \n\nI would recommend this restaurant."

This establishment is definitely overrated but a nice meal can be found here. \n\nTwo stars lost for lack of service and overall experience our server Jim was  inattentive and left us asking for water, bread, and the check from other waiters, busboys whomever we could find. While seated outside we saw a rat in the bushes behind one of their covered seating areas within the walls of the patio it was a bit alarming but I told myself we were outdoors and that can happen. (Wishful thinking) Really I didn't want to ruin our meal. It was there the entire time. When we were leaving I went to put my hand on the railing and there was a roach on it yuck!\nThe food was ok nothing to rave about. \n\nOne star- very pretty indoor space however the outdoor space is where you want to sit. Lanterns hung from trees and candlelight it's very inviting. Cons they have one tree that isn't lit according to the server it hasn't been for a while, while sitting by this tree it became extremely difficult to see even the servers made comments as they brought our food about how dark it was. \nNevertheless it felt romantic. \n\nOne Star- Food. We started out with a cheese and meat pairing. I went safe with the cheese as the waiter really had no suggestions to offer us. We chose the Fontina with prosciutto and venison salami this was pretty good the meats were the star of the show I wish I chose a sharper cheese but I was still happy. My husband really liked the accompanying jams that came with the plate that was his favorite part of the meal. The calamari was well cooked  however the curry aioli was a little overwhelming and took away the freshness of the dish. I ordered the veal scaloppine and he ordered the NY strip. My veal was mediocre nothing really outstanding about the dish and the pasta was similar to a dish a make at home nothing special. My husband ordered his steak medium rare, it came out medium/medium well. He was not happy. For dessert we ordered two espressos and the Turkish cheesecake. This was my favorite part of the meal mainly because of the honey they served  with the cake was a small piece of a honeycomb. The honey and the blueberry jam were the best parts of the entire meal. \n\nOne star- Overall it was a nice meal, we would probably go back for the ambiance drinks and appetizers."

The fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauces also weren't over powering the salmon and lobster. I was a big fan of the corn. I just love corn in my food. It made it perfect!\n\nWe ended with the strawberry shortcake dessert. It wasn't too sweet, and it came in a cute little glass. \n\nService wasn't amazing and extravagant, but the waiter was very knowledgeable and knew what he was talking about! Definitely will go back."

Sometimes, I'll stop just for cocktails and enjoy the service at the bar. But the real treat is the food....and of course, the wine. The staff is very wine knowledgable and eagerly assist with pairings. And if you are looking for a good pairing, start with a fromage platter. Occasionally, the staff is slow when it's particularly busy, but that is rare and you shouldn't let that dampen your opinion of the food and the wine. Be prepared to be wowed!"

But appearances aside, the lunch menu offered the usual lunch flatbreads, sandwiches, entrees, appetizers, and salads for around $10-$25 depending on size and menu location (Half portions offered as well which were big enough for a typical lunch). There was also a $25 lunch menu that came with an entree and appetizer, but limited selections of each.\n\nI opted for some salmon and wasn't blown away, but nothing to complain about - it was a very good piece of fish.  Cut and cooked well, with great skin flavor.  It came with a pretty solid sized farm side salad as well.\n\nService was nice up front but slow at the tables.  They come around with fresh bread a la carte too.  I also hear this is the place to come for a high-end Happy Hour meetup in the area.  Price-wise is comparable to a lower strip restaurant, and food quality is on par with that.  I recommend coming for lunch rather than dinner to give the place a try, then splurge if you enjoy your meal out."

They have a nice patio for nice evenings or afternoons as well.  \n\nThe bad, well not terrible but not that good, was the food.  I don't remember what I had except for some fancy burger for lunch that I didn't enjoy much.  I went with good friends and tried a few different things and just wasn't impressed, unmemorable I guess and I was just there about a month ago.  Actually I do remember the cheese platter we had and they have a large selection to choose from, the portions were real small, even for a cheese platter.  My girlfriend had a flatbread for lunch and is wasn't that remarkable either.   \n\nThe service we had both times was not so good, lunch being pretty bad, no where near the service of rosemary's, not even close.\n\nI guess if I am going to spend over a 150 bucks on dinner for two I want incredible food with excellent service, anything less and I am just disappointed.  I don't know whats up but both meals I had here just fell flat.  \n\nIt seems like the owners set out to make the coolest restaurant off the strip, they did.  The place is real cool and they put effort into having a cool menu with elaborate descriptions.  Perhaps I just prefer having food that taste great, satisfies, and speaks for itself, I don't know."

Place is nice, more upscale than I had thought... But that's okay. We sat. Our waiter came over and I was immediately turned off of the place. No welcome, no introduction, nothing. Just what can I get you to drink. Because we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, I feel the waiter put us on the back burner. I ordered an orange juice that was never refilled throughout my meal. My grandma ordered coffee that was also not refilled. We all ordered off of the pre fixed Mother's Day special menu. We all got three different appetizers and entrees. I wasn't expecting to wait as long as I did for the courses. Seemed that the kitchen wasn't prepared to put out the menu they had running. The dishes arrived at all different times for each course.. Leaving the family waiting once again to eat. The halibut had no sauce, leaving it dry. The lamb was chewy and almost tough on the outside. Chicken was good, except the Mac n cheese needs some help. Desserts were the best part. The busser or back waiter (whichever) was very nice and accommodating to us. I give him 5 stars. Other than the initial hello and dropping the check, I didn't see the waiter at all. All in all, service needs help.. Kitchen needs preparation. I will return, only because this may have been just an off day for the establishment."

Delicious! \n\nTo start they brought out bread that was completely cold I'm not sure if this is normal or not. We had some hummus and pita which was ok. Cesar salad was ok but not very flavorful. I had the corn ravioli which I thought was oddly thick in terms of the pasta itself almost as if it wasn't cooked properly. The sauce and inside of the ravioli was also not impressive. My boyfriend had the halibut which was pretty dry and fishy and the couscous underneath wasn't great either. For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake which oddly didn't taste very strongly of chocolate. \n\nI don't really want to come back and try this place without a set menu just because this experience was pretty disappointing and I know this place is pricey."

When you walk into patio area, the ambiance is chic and romantic.  The inside of the restaurant reminds me a little of Mix at THEHotel with the white decor but much more subdued with the lighting.  Patio has beautiful atmosphere, soft music, gas fire pit and sofa seating.  On the weekends or on certain nights a dj will start to play music later in the evening but keeping with the atmosphere the music is not loud or wild - very soft techno-ish dance music - a nice touch in my opinion.  This is definitely a trendy see and be seen venue.  Beautiful people in the bar area and the bar staff will remember you when you come back.  \nGood bartenders who actually chat with you are hard to find.  These guys/gals are great!  The pizzas are amazing as well if you don't want a full blown meal.  I have never been disappointed with this place.  A great date night place, or a place to go with the girls afterwork or girls night out (starting place anyway!). One of my favorite places on the westside!"

I really liked the d\u00e9cor and you didn't feel at all like you were in a business park. \n\nWe were quickly seated by the hostess when we arrived (she could have been friendlier) and ended up between two larger, and louder, tables. I don't blame the restaurant - it just got really loud being by these tables. Eventually they both left and it calmed down a bit.\n\nThe food was very good. We shared a meat and cheese platter, which was delicious. We followed with a Italian sausage flatbread and the braised lamb Bolognese. Both were very good. The meal was finished with a birthday dessert, which did not disappoint.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving this visit a higher rating is because of the service. Our server was very friendly, but he seemed to go missing at times. He was always apologetic when he returned, but it just happened a little too much. We only had two courses, but we were there for three hours.  Don't get me wrong, I like to linger for a fine meal, but this was a little too long."

It seemed like the pasta had been sitting around and when I ordered, they mixed in the sauce and stuck it in the microwave.  The truffle ricotta was great.  If they had cooked some fresh tagliatelle, tossed it with the lamb sauce just before serving, and topped it with the ricotta, this would have been great.

If the criteria for five stars is \"as good as it gets\" then I'd say without reservation that Vintner Grill is as good as Vegas gets. \n\nHere's the breakdown\n\nAMBIANCE: 5\nFOOD TASTE/QUALITY: 5\nFOOD CREATIVITY: 4\nSERVICE: 4.5\n\nOverall, what I like about Vintner Grill was that it delivered on providing an experience. And there are are not many places in this town (off-strip) that even attempt to do that. The overall aesthetic is a modern take on a light Art Deco/1930s decor. Everything from the black and white checkered floor to the white and pastel green color scheme worked to set a mood from the moment you walk in. If you're reading other reviews, you already know the restaurant is located inside a business center--and it's that very juxtaposition between the bland stucco sameness of the business center and soft, light and glossy interior of the restaurant that left me feeling transported. The contrast of the business center location totally works in Vintner Grill's favor by creating an immediate expectation of luxury and quality. And Vintner delivers on both fronts.\n\nOur party ordered and shared:\nTwo of their signature cocktails\nCheese and meat platter\nLamb bolognese\nNY strip\nHalibut on couscous and orzo\nWhite bean hummus\nTiramisu\nCarmel upside down cake\nTurkish coffee cheesecake\n\nWe were thoroughly pleased with all but one dish-and even that dish (cheesecake)  was fine. The dishes were not overly creative and clever, but they were all seasoned well,  made with high quality ingredients, and prepared with skill.  The food was delicious. The seafood was fresh and buttery while the steaks were tender and cooked perfectly. This was one of the two best NY strip steaks I've had in this town. The bolognese was heavy and the truffle oil threatened to over power the flavor of the sauce, but the richness of the lamb and sauce made for a dish that most people at our table called the best of the night.\n\nThe service was considered, the food was delicious, and the decor / atmosphere was luxurious.  I will definitely return to Vintner Grill."

There were four of us, one underage for drinking.\nThis restaurant is truly a gift to the summerlin part of Vegas, only wish they could more consistently pull it off.\nAtmosphere: the appearance of the grill may be one of its greatest strengths. It's located in an office park but offers valet parking. Once you leave the parking lot ou enter what appears to be a green and black oasis with outside seating in three sided tents that make even 90 degree days possible outside. Inside, is the appearance of a lounge with sofa like booths and pillows scattered among them. The reality is that sitting in those booths is uncomfortable, pick a chair.  There is a large bar and bar table seating area when you enter.\nService: We were greeted and seated quickly and our waiter quickly introduced himself. Immediately he was very familiar, wanting to call us by our first names and acting like we were buddies. This is not a style of service we desired, so this was an irritating factor that got increasingly irritating. When the waiter said to our underage diner, \"go ahead and order a drink, I won't tell.\" we were less than happy, but he thought it was funny.\nFood:  we started with a combination cheese charcuterie platter and some cocktails. You select as many cheeses as you desire from a long and very interesting list divided by type of milk. This list is truly a strength. Then there is a selection of charcuterie including boar and elk. We tried both and they were good. The cheeses were all good. They are served with some dried fruit, crackers and honey.  The mains were all fine but way too much going on.  It was hard to decipher any particular flavor. I had the ravioli, which is a very small serving of several raviolis that are a bit hard in the edges. One of us had a dish with apricots where the apricots were clearly not ripe and had no flavor. In fact, we didn't believe they were apricots except that is what the menu said. They have several distinct cocktails but some good old fashioned cocktails would have been appreciated.\nWhen we left the waiter said, \"can I call you bob\" when he saw the credit card. Just too much familiarity. This is a restaurant with hits and misses. Stick to the simpler things for better chance of getting the hits."

For one there are no capitol letters and the font can't be any bigger than size 10 so I sort of found it difficult to read. Secondly, nothing really sounded that good, maybe they switch it up often. \n\nGirlfriend had some sort of girly pear drink in a martini glass, this probably stood out the most. It almost tasted like drinking a fresh pear but with a little booze, quite good. On the other hand, my Coors Light tasted like beer. \n\nSeveral different artisan type breads were offered, we tried a couple, I like the pretzel one the best. \n\nFor dinner I had the mushroom risotto and GF had a steak. Risotto was fine, GF's steak came pre-cut up into little pieces. Is this supposed to be for the dog? We both thought that was pretty odd and basically cheating if they're trying to see how well they cooked it. \n\nTo wrap it up, we had the tiramisu. Our waiter said it was the best ever (I hate it when wait staff say that). It was good, I mean it's not like I'm not going to eat a big cup of tiramisu but it was by no means the best ever.

Ambiance, furnishings were done to T and even the music was a nice mix of Sinatra, modern and classic.\n\nWine list - According to our friend, most impressive and fair, we have been many places together and he rated this one of the best he has seen in some time.\n\nFood - The meat and cheese selection was perfect with many choices, steak, scallops and one other dish (can't remember sorry) all achieved the highest of marks and there wasn't anything left on the plates. We skipped dessert so can't comment.\n\nIn closing - We will be back and if you live here in Vegas or are visiting I strongly urge you to give this place a try...you will not be sorry.\n\nSmall warning - Not cheap, but not Strip expensive either, if you order right.\n\nNice job Vintner!!!!"

Off strip in the Summerlin, you won't see it from the main streets, just off Charleston & everyone's favorite to say street, Hualapai (\"Wall-a-pie\").  You'll be surprised how they've sandwiched a fine dining place within a corporate plaza and offices.\n\nThe food and service is top notch.  I've been a handful of times, catching happy hour to dining first class all-the-while mainly with Summerlin locals.  White leather, browns, greens, chandeliers sets the ambiance ablaze.  Plus, their is a blaze of fire with outdoor firepits in luxurious outdoor patio seating.\n\nRecommended\n============\n1.  Roasted Beet salad with lavender goat cheese, mango, hazelnuts and mustard vinaigrette dressing (5.0 stars, $10)\n\n2.  Italian Sausage Flatbread with burrata cheese, roasted peppers, pesto sauce ($12, 4.5 stars)\n\n3.  Wild Mushroom Risotto with preserved lemon, pepper, and shaved pecorino ($24, 4.5 stars)\n\n4.  Braised Lamb Osso Bucco with couscous, shallots, and swiss chard ($32, 4.5 stars)\n\nConclusion\n=========\nWith service always pro, food great, this is a great off-strip place to save a few dollars without skimping on experience.  Shhhh...hidden secret.  \n\nParking Tip: you can valet, or park a ten spots over and not have a problem in the lot."

These are the reasons we sat for two and a half hours. Completely unnecessary for a work lunch. \n\nI enjoyed the the decor as it was clean, simple and beautiful. The food was all served in impressive artistic forms and the menu had a wide variety of wonderful dishes, comfort food and unique dishes."

It is fairly pricey, but it's totally worth it, especially if you're looking for somewhere to celebrate a special occasion.\n\nOver our honeymoon in October 2015, my husband and I made a reservation at Vintner for dinner.  When we got there, the restaurant overbooked and didn't have enough tables to seat us during our reservation time.  The manager came out to personally apologize for our extra wait, gave us each a drink on the house, and then we were seated about 30 minutes after our reservation time.  I was really impressed with the way that they handled it, and I've never gotten such incredible service like that for a mistake on the restaurants part.\n\nThe food is AMAZING! The octopus appetizer is out of this world!  After our meals, we ordered dessert, asked for the check, and the waiter noticed that my husband was in the military. When the waiter brought the check back, the manager had given us our dessert on the house to thank my husband for his service.  \n\nAmazing staff, food, and all around a fantastic restaurant.  My husband and I visit Las Vegas about once a year, and we will always make sure to stop by Vintner."

The bartender exhibited a VERY bad attitude. She was busy cleaning something and I seemed to be a distraction. She could not have made a mistake we had to be wrong. The waiter was apologetic but seemed incompetent and failed to follow up to be sure we got our drinks. We spoke with the manager who came across like a total idiot.

We both got different times available to us. Made the planning a bit awkward. So, if someone at OpenTable see's this review, get your act together.\n\nOk, now on to the important stuff.\n\nFood, very good. I had the hummus, and then a flatbread (pizza type). They have a guy who comes around with about 10 different styles of bread. At the table, the butter is actually shaped as a dish, and has two indents. One contains olive oil, the other...I forgot, but it was good. It's hard to describe. And no, I didn't take a picture. The butter dish thing is also covered in sea salt and pepper for added goodness.\n\nThe menu is a bit uncomfortable. The first two pages are just meats and cheeses. The menu is a bit confusing and overwhelming.\n\nOur server seemed to give us a little attitude when we asked questions about how the first two pages of the menu worked. He then went into a routine about the menu, specials, etc. It was very rehearsed and the conversation didn't really feel natural. It didn't feel like he was offering or sharing any useful info. This is the only reason why I say it was a 3.5 star experience.\n\nAlso, when I had some leftovers, I asked for a box. The look on the servers face was as if I had offended him.\n\nI'm making this review sound way more negative than it should be. \n\nI had a very nice meal here, and overall, I'd come back for a nice occasion.\n\nP.S.

When I did tell the waitress she looked at me like she had never heard of the word vegan and said she didn't know what that meant.  Great.  So, I explained it to her and she said she would ask the kitchen.  Long story short the chef took some pizza dough and some noodles and made a marinara sauce with some veggies, put half on the pizza and half on the noodles and gave it to us.  So little care and thought from a place so highly rated.  I will not go back."

If you can find it, leave a trail of bread crumbs on your way home because you WILL want to go back!\n\nFrom the Blood Orange Cable Car (pre-dinner cocktail) to the Tiramisu, every course was outstanding. Though I had heard good things about the cheese course here, it was the only part of the meal that didn't knock my socks off. But the cheese list is so extensive I'd be willing to give it another shot next time around. Maybe we will find something better suited to our taste. Next we had crab cakes and white bean hummus with pita. ROOKIE MISTAKE! This being a higher end eatery, we were expecting \"Iron Chef\" sized courses. But portions are generous so don't let your eyes get ahead of your tummy like we did. \n\nOur entrees came after a short wait (just enough time to let the first two courses settle). My girlfriend had chicken with mac and cheese. No kidding! Simple fare for a nice restaurant, huh? But they really made it pop. That pretty much describes the whole menu here. Nothing too cutting edge but top notch ingredients and preparation make every dish \"to die for.\" I had the lamb tagine and it was perfect. As I told my girlfriend, this is my new favorite dish! Like the appetizers, entree portions were pretty huge. Every customer in the place left with a doggie bag. We left with two.\n\nDespite the fact that we were both STUFFED at this point, we could not pass up dessert. She had the banana, peanut butter, chocolate pie and I had the tiramisu. Both were light as a feather and richer than Scrooge McDuck! I don't know how they pulled that off, but SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!!\n\nI've read reviews from others complaining of slow service, but that certainly was not our experience. We arrived 15 minutes before our reserved time (we heard it was hard to find so we started out early) but we were seated immediately. This is on the Sunday night before Valentine's. Granted our reservations were for 7 pm and there were several empty tables. Our server, Jeff, was a on top of things from the moment we sat down until the check was paid. We never felt rushed or neglected and he helped us with some wonderful suggestions. Even the bread server came around three times during the meal. The atmosphere was elegant but relaxed and very romantic. Overall, it was one of the best dining experiences we've had in Las Vegas. I'm patting myself on the back for finding Vintner Grill this Valentines! It might just become an annual tradition. Although I doubt we will go just once a year."

Tucked into the back of an office park (really) one comes through the back parking lot into..... \"Voila!\"  Valet parking, white linen table cloths, outdoor fire pits in a tiered outdoor dining landscape, white tented private dining areas - and then a beautiful long bar inside with more great seating, white leather booths, more.  If you were dropped into this spot with no clue where you were, you would guess Miami Beach.  \n\nUpscale, fantastic wines, good service and an interesting crowd that is mostly 40-60-ish early in the evening and then becomes the hip spot for the upscale younger crowd until the last hour of the evening when it again calms down and people stop for a nightcap or dessert on the way home from a show, the Strip, whatever.  \n\nBut great people-watching and always good conversation with some fascinating person/people when I go there to eat at the bar, and I often do go alone.  Food is quite good, although I would say there are places in Summerlin where the food is just as good, perhaps even better, and it would cost you 25-50% less. So you're paying for extraordinary ambiance (relatively speaking).  However, if you are out at the Red Rock Resort (or the JW Marriott) in Summerlin and want to do something fun and different one night - or if you're a local - this is something a little different, and in my opinion, worth it."

He didn't introduce himself, just stopped in to take our drink order, and I'm not sure he smiled once while interacting with us our entire meal. It didn't help that the server at the next table seemed to go out of his way for his customers. I've honestly had better service at the Wendy's. Food was okay, but nothing to write home about."

It's classy decor, beautiful outside patio, service and quality of food is amazing. \n\nI love when the staff comes by with the tray of bread and I get to pick my favorites: brioche, pretzel bread and white chocolate bread. The butter tray with the oil in it is delicious... I always look forward to the bread. \n\nI always order the calamari, the dipping sauce is so yummy! \n\nAnd I always used to order the Halibut with couscous, but when I went recently I was sad to see that the halibut now comes with leeks and muscles. Not really my cup of tea... I really miss the cous cous recipe with the lemon spinach orzo, so I hope they will consider bringing that back! \n\nHowever, I did order the turkey burger with avocado, cheese and bacon... It was so delicious! Something I normally wouldn't order, but it was so yummy. I skipped the bun, though because it seemed a little big. \n\nFor dessert, their tiramisu is my favorite. It's big enough to share, and when I was pregnant I would kill the whole thing on my own. \n\nWhenever my friends or family is in town and I want to impress them, I bring them here!"

What happened?\n\nWhat was probably my 20th dinner there, last week the Consul of Chile and I met a friend from Spain, whom we felt confident would appreciate the introduction.   We were mistaken.\n\nApart from the 'open during construction' idea which would seem to think you dine out for food alone, the tables in the bar area were no longer clothed.  We immediately noticed that the surface of the table was thick with grease build-up, a sign of lax practices in cleanliness.  This is not the old Vintner!  \n\nTwo salads ordered were quite good, if unimaginative.  Vintner was always had great risotto, but no longer, at least not according to my shrimp risotto.  The shrimp was of a 99-cent shrimp cocktail quality, with tails left on, just laying on top of the risotto, which itself was so salty as to be inedible. \n\nAdd to this the fact that the two gin and tonics I sent back were both flat.  When the waiter told me that was impossible the second time around, I asked for a chardonnay instead.  He asked \"what kind?\"  I replied to ask what they had, to which he said, \"French or Californian.\"  So much for that whole \"vintner\" theme, huh?  His attitude told me I'd better choose one, shut up and return to my salt lick.  We had to flag the waiter several times, or have other waiters go find him.  Not pleasant. \n\nI hope they pull it together.  It was a nice place before.  It won't be back until someone credible insists it has successfully risen again!"

There was a fixed menu consisting of 3 appetizers and a choice among 3 entrees.  \n\nTHE APPETIZERS: Simple yet deliciously satisfying!\n1) curry chicken on baked chips\n2) kobe beef sliders w/ bacon\n3) sauteed mushrooms on top of a crostini with goat cheese\n\nCHOICE OF ENTREES: Please refer to my pictures of the 2 entrees me and the bf chose to get a better idea of how incredibly delicious our food was!  \n1) Pasta with greens, prosciutto, tomatoes, and goat cheese--I chose this dish.\n2) Broiled chicken with mac 'n cheese and broccoli--the bf chose this dish.\n3) Pasta in lamb ragu \n\nBTW, the reception had an open bar and the bar itself was fully stocked :)  The bartender was very generous with our drinks ;)  As for dessert we had a piece of the wedding cake along with an ice cream station that was set up outside in the patio area.  \n\nI'm looking forward to our next Vegas trip to eat and drink here again."

I think that's really the best way to put it, she just didn't care, like she's worked there for too long and she just doesn't care. When we got there she told us that the table was being setup, and the silverware must have been flown in from China while we waited, because we waited for 30min for that setup.\n\nOut server was even worse. After we got seated it took 20min for him to come by and give us the menus, then another 20min until he stopped by again to take out drink orders and we ordered food as well getting the sense of their pace. Then another 20min for HALF our party to get their drink orders.\n\nWe had to chase the waiter down for round x2 drinks that were promised and of course came only after another 20min of waiting.\n\nBeginning of the night the waiter told us that Vintner is Strip quality food off the Strip. Well on the Strip, Strip quality food also tends to come with Strip quality service.\n\nWhat a shame really. The food was good and the ambience was fantastic. But the wait stuff was so bad it's stupid.\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant."

Well, the waiter went in and out of the kitchen at least four times until we were finished with the rest of our meal.  When he took our entree plates away, I asked him what the chef had said.  He said that the chef had told him they had used the cole slaw that they  \"had left\".  \n\nI was never offer a different side dish, and needless to say there was no accommodation on the bill.

The steak was very good considering it was cooked as ordered, well done. \nAnother entr\u00e9e was Grilled Lobster with Mussels, miniature cubed potato's all served in a saffron broth.

Don't be fooled by the terrible office complex setting. Inside is not too formal that it feels stuffy but not too casual to feel \"cheap\" (baseball caps and jeans are definitely a no no here). The decor is inspired but not overwhelming or loud  as to make you feel like ya gotta save this place for somethin special. Basically, if I could decorate my house like Vitner Grill, I'd be happy (love the greens, whites and blacks). \n\nThe food. Amazing. The ever changing menu means you can try and try and try and probably not have the same thing more than once (even tho you'd really want to because IT'S THAT GOOD). Fish dishes, chicken dishes , pasta dishes and even vegetarian dishes all done well.  The Mac & Cheese is incredible!\n\nAnd three...the price. I don't mind paying for a great meal. BUT I can get a great meal, great service and great ambiance at Vitner Grill without my checking account hating me. Love. Sure, it's not Denny's cheap but then again, do you \"really\" like Denny's? \nThe flatbread (pizzas) range from $12-$20 and are definitely enough for 2 people. The entrees all come with sides and believe me, you won't be hungry after cleaning your plate. \n\nMake a reservation as they do tend to fill up on the weekend (and sit on the back patio if the weather is right)!"

I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn't your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. \n\nIf cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.\n\nOut server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the \"Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad\" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn't stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the \"Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad\" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it. \n\nVintner Grill is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate an occasion with family and friends. VG has a private party space and also offers catering."

Our reservation was at 630pm on a Friday night.  This place is west of the strip, so I'm glad I didn't have to run into freeway and Strip traffic, and the casino crowds.  Parking was easy to find and we were seated right away when we went in.  It started to get busy towards 730 or so.\n\nWe had the meats and cheeses selection for appetizers and decided on a combination of 2 meats and 3 types of cheeses.  The sliced duck was surprisingly good and the prosciutto was great.  The cheeses we selected (sorry forgot the specifics) was tasty as well, aside from the goat cheese.\n\nNow, the reason for my first comment above was that this was my night where my food picks were wrong, but everyone else I came with enjoyed their meals.  I got the lobster risotto, which was a special for the day.  Seeing enough Hell's Kitchen, where they offer risotto as a dish, I decided to give it a try. Plus, this was recommended by the waiter.  More often than not, when I rely on the waiter's recommendation, the dish turns out pretty good, but tonight was not the case.   First, I was expecting a lobster tail, maybe even a small one or half a tail.  But, all I got was a small claw and some rice for dinner.  So, I knew I was going to be starving.  Then, the risotti itself was bland and did not have much of a taste.  I bet you predicted I was asking my family to try their dishes during dinner.  haha.\n\nAs mentioned, the rest of my party enjoyed their selections.  My wife had osso buco and she enjoyed it pretty much.  It was a good size portion and she was pleased.  She savored the marrow last, which was still inside the bone.  My mother-in-law had the scallops and they were cooked just right.  My father-in-law had the bone-in ribeye and he enjoyed it very much.  He raved about how it was so good and soft the whole night.  I had a piece and it was pretty good.  He mentioned it was better than Ruth Chris and Flemings.  Hmm...Ruth Chris maybe, but it may be around Flemings caliber or a little under.  Then again, I just had a piece and he had the whole steak.  Next, my sister-in-law had Bouillabaisse.  She tried my risotto and agreed, no flavor.  She felt sorry for me and gave me a scallop, which was tasty.\n\nDessert time...  I had maple sugar creme brulee.  Creme brulee happens to be pretty high up on my dessert favorites.  It was pretty good, but the maple taste was a slight twist.  The maple taste reminded me of pancakes for breakfast.  Overall, I prefer the traditional creme brulee taste than the maple flavor, but would recommend others to try this dessert.  My wife had the lemon cheesecake and she thought it was one of the better cheesecakes she's had in a while.  Father-in-law was happy with his apple pie a-la mode, but we wasn't raving about it like he did with his rib-eye.  Mother and sister-in-law shared a dark chocolate dessert and they were really happy as well.\n\nGiven that we had an appetizer, a bottle of wine, dinner, and dessert, I was thinking at least $100 per head, but it turned out to be way less than that, which is definitely a plus.\n\nSo all-in-all, I got the wrong dish, but everyone else made the right selections.  With that said, I will definitely go back to this place for the service, ambience, and the fact that my family enjoyed their meals.  I just won't select lobster risotto ever."

Cute patio to the left with cabana, string lights, and posh furnishing as you walk towards this randomly placed restaurant. Once you go through the doors, you walk into a cute waiting area with a black and white film playing against the walls. The hostess was on the phone as we entered so we thought we'd enjoy the time to just appreciate the decor. She hangs up, and then the phone rings again and she takes it. Doesn't bother us too much cause we were still fascinated by the casual elegance and continuing on with our conversation. Then she hangs up the phone once more and of course, the phone rings again and she picks it up. Okay now we're mad. HI, DID I FORGET TO TAKE MY INVISIBILITY CLOAK OFF IN THE CAR OR SOMETHING? So lucky us the manager was walking towards the stand and we knew we would soon be sat. NOOOPE. He was watching her talk on the phone and then looked down at the books while I was still standing there with no acknowledgement of me and my guest at all until I said the first hello. OH ALL OF A SUDDEN I APPEARED and he sat us. \n\nIt took awhile for the server to come greet us and I was getting irritated to the point that I was ready to place the total tip on the table and slowly take each dollar away so they can visually see how much they are sucking! Sorry, but it was our anniversary dinner (which they were informed of) so I was really hoping for a special experience! This review has moved down to two stars at this point.  Anyway the server finally noticed us and took our order. My boyfriend ordered a glass of McCallan 18 neat and it took them 20 minutes to get it to him, AFTER I reminded the server at the 15 minute mark. I mean, come on, you literally just open the bottle and pour it in the glass. It takes 10 seconds, probably even less. So we're obviously VERY frustrated at this point. To add to this horrible experience, the server is standing in front of our table and starts making comments about killing some guy in the restaurant and bad mouthing him like crazy to another employee. ARE WE ON MYSTERY DINERS?? Cause this service just seems so dramatically terrible. \n\nLuckily this place offers some tasty looking entrees that are decently priced. We started with salads - the caesar ($10) and the house ($9.50). I know caesar salads are simple, but I absolutely loved it here! It was basically a wedge of romaine lettuce wrapped with prosciutto and stuffed with three long bread sticks. Simple but very delicious. For the main entree, I went with the veal and angel hair pasta dish ($32) and the boyfriend went with the honey glazed chicken ($22). Skip the veal and go for the chicken! \n\nDuring our meal, the server came by and apologized for his manner earlier and that he didn't mean for us to hear all his negative comments. Okay, that's nice, but that doesn't excuse anything honestly. It's not hard to keep your opinions to yourself or at least go into a back room to vent if needed. \n\nBack to 3 stars ONLY because I actually enjoyed the food. Overall I would possibly consider returning because the flatbreads looked worth trying, but I feel like I would really have to grit my teeth on making the effort because the service was extremely lacking..."

Our server was Marcelo and he took amazing care of us. The service was excellent and the presentation was beautiful. Everything we ate from appetizers to desserts was delicious. We will go back every time we visit Las Vegas. If you go to or live in Las Vegas Vintner Grill is a must.  It is not on the strip but it is well worth the drive. Thank you everyone."

They overcooked the steak the first shot, so I sent it back.  The second shot was WAY undercooked, but I didn't send it back again.\n\nThe second time I went for lunch, I ordered the steak sandwich.  I ordered it medium, yet once again it was undercooked.  I didn't send it back because the people I was with kept on telling me how good a restaurant it was, and so I didn't send it back because I didn't want them to look bad..  So instead, I choked down my undercooked steak sandwich.\n\nThis last time I ordered the scallops.  They did not taste fresh at all.  Over $30 for 3 fishy tasting scallops????\n\nThis place has a stuffy atmosphere and horrible food.  I will never go back."

The server did not smile, did not seem happy to be there. It actually seemed like a hassle when we did have to converse during ordering. I tried not to get upset but when we ordered salads before our dinner it took thirty minutes to get our salads and our dinner was brought out before we were even done with our salads. Again, we were not offered a dessert menu and I was given the check before I was able to ask for a box for my left overs. This place has definitely gone down hill and it's upsetting due to it being such a local favorite. It it's definitely not on our restaurant list anymore."

Some of us wanted to order appetizers while others wanted to wait, so our waiter wouldn't let us order at our leisure. He says \"wait until everyone is ready to order their appetizers\" and walked away. WHAT??  I thought it was a joke. He asked my wife if she wanted a drink and when she declined he began walking away - I had to get his attention to place my drink order when I was sitting right next to her. He was just very rude the entire night, didn't take care of us by any means and we were a relaxed group just enjoying conversation with each other throughout the night. We were pretty easy to please, yet this guy fell very short. He never apologized to us and continued to be rude down to the last second of our stay. I was actually looking forward to eating here tonight and it was such a let down. The terrible service made the food extremely forgettable. Not worth it."

Although, there were a few open tables I'm assuming they save for walk ins. Our host was wonderful and very welcoming.\n\nMichael was our server and he was very good. All his recommendations were spot on and he was prompt and attentive without being a helicopter. \n\nHANDS DOWN: FRIED CHICKEN. Try that first. It is the most flavorful and moist chicken I have ever had in my life. Even the breast was so tender and juicy that it didn't taste like white meat. \n\nAlso had the lamb bolognese which was very hearty and tasty. I prefer my bolongese with beef however. \n\nThe mango panna cotta was a great light and refreshing end to our meal. \n\nThe ambiance is lively and the restaurant is beautiful. Definitely not one you'd expect in the middle of an office park. Parking is a little confusing with the signs indicating that you can't park in office spaces.. I'm assuming it doesn't apply on the weekends?\n\nAlso. there seems to be an underlying/unspoken dress code here. Ladies- you can get away with jeans and heels.. Men-- you can get away with a collared polo, shorts and Sperrys (as that seemed to be the common attire of the evening)."

The inside looks very elegant, but the patio is much more quiet and romantic. It is the perfect atmosphere for a date. The inside would be great for a large group.\n\nFor an appetizer we chose the hummus based on the yelp reviews.

My girlfriend had the scallops which were also good.\n\nPrices are around $30-40 per plate which is still cheaper than top restaurants on the strip. \n\nContrary to negative reviews, we did not have any issues with service.\n\nThe only issue we did have was that the fire alarm went off for about 20 minutes about 2/3 into our meal. Luckily we were outside so it wasn't too disruptive. Despite this disruption I would eat here again."

            "review": "My experience at Vintner Grill was truly amazing.  After hearing many great reviews from friends, my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to check it out for ourselves on NYE.  The location is low key and secluded, once you walk in...you're almost transported to an entirely different world.  The decor, the old black and white movies...you almost feel like a part of old world, glam Hollywood.  The hostesses were sweet, very nice...(had to ask guests a few times \"you name again?\") but again...very nice.  \n\nWe got a fabulous table right in the corner....the couch seating along the wall was awesome. I had a great view of the entire dining room and felt very comfortable even though the place was PACKED.  The bread offering was yummy, my favorites were the pretzel bread and bacon cranberry bread.  YES, I said bacon.  YUM.\n\nWhen we sat down, we were introduced to the special NYE menu that was being offered for the night...but we opted to order off the regular menu.\n\nFor our first course, we ordered a trio of \"fromage and carne\".  Cheese and meat.  The menu offers (and thoroughly introduces) all of their cheese offerings and different meats.  We got 2 cheeses recommended by our waiter and prosciutto.  The platter came with homemade blueberry jam, honey mustard, dried apricot, and the most DELICIOUS cheese crusted bread.  I had a pineapple martini with this course...it was good.  A nice sturdy martini with (what tasted like) real pineapple.  It wasn't syrup-y or too sweet.  Just right...a perfect starter for our meal.\n\nFor dinner, my fianc\u00e9 had kobe steak. De-LICIOUS.  and if you've never had kobe beef, may I PLEASE suggest you try it.  Truly, a cut of meat above and beyond all of the other fabulous cuts of meat out there.  I forget what his steak came with...but I do remember the plate being completely empty and him saying that it was \"very very good\".  I on the other hand was intrigued and oohing over every thing on the menu. I settled for the half chicken with lobster mac and cheese with broccolini.  Sounds good right?  It was okay.  I typically never order chicken...I wish I had ordered the scallops (which I spied on someone else's table...LOOKED YUMMY!!)...but I ordered it because I'm a sucker for mac and cheese...and LOBSTER mac and cheese?  Forget it.  I was sold.  It was good..but again, I plan on returning to Vintner Grill to try MORE!  I had a caipirinha with my dinner...it was one of the best I've had.  Even our waiter, who was from Brazil, said that theirs was one of the most authentic.  Sugarcane rum...can't beat it.\n\nWe finished off our meal with seriously the bet tiramisu I've had.  I've been \"deserting\" with tiramisu since a very young age.  And truly...I was and am impressed.  \n\nSo, in short...we are definitely going back.  There's also an amazing patio with a fire pit and twinkling lights that I want to enjoy once the weather warms.  And I urge you, my fellow yelpers, to check it out.  \n\nVintner Grill...you're pretty awesome."

            "review": "First heard of Vintner Grill during my real estate group's cocktail party launch of Diamond Cake magazine. Finally made it around to having dinner here last Saturday. It is tucked away in an office complex off Charleston. The entry is unassuming and easy to miss.\nThe decor is upscale chic modern. We were seated right away as we made reservations from Open Table off Yelp.\nThe clientele that night seemed to be predominantly retiree age with a few scattered specks of youth. Our observation was that most of the women in there looked miserable. (You can marry for money but it doesn't buy happiness). You must come dressed up here or feel dramatically out of place amidst the money crowd. Luckily we came prepared.\nIt took a while for someone to finally come over to bring us a menu and take drink orders. The cocktail menu consisted of old timer favorites with modern ingredients. For such a fancy place, they could have utilized a classier menu holder, rather than a plain clipboard.\nThe selections seemed standard when comparing to previous posts of the menu with some slight changes. One of our favorite things was the butter dish with wells of infused olive oil...a welcomed forbidden treat after a week of \"clean eating\". The bread selection was very nice as well...get the brioche and try the cranberry bacon loaf. We each ordered the butter lettuce salad with warm Brie. The salad was a little difficult to eat because of large leaves but the encrusted Brie was good.\nI ordered the Mediterranean sea bass with haricot vert (French baby green beans), potatoes and chopped olives. The fish was fresh and light just like a sea bass should be, the veges were a nice accompaniment and retained their crispness. My wife ordered the veal scallopini with angel hair pasta. I tried some and it was delicious. Lean, thin veal cutlets in a wonderful marsala sauce. I would order that the next time. The wine was a Malbec that was smooth and light. They bring the bottle to the table to pour. The waiter seemed a bit too touchy feely for our comfort but not too creepy lol. Service was slow at some points. The prices are Strip prices without the Strip feel. As a local, I would rather spend my money on a restaurant on the Strip next time for the same quality of food with a little better service and much better ambiance."

They had a booth at the Taco's and Tequila Festival in Lake Las Vegas over Memorial day weekend and in my opinion had the best food. The buffalo ribs were fantastic. Well I planned a stay-cation at Red Rock and decided I would go with my friend and finally try Vintners Grill.  I made a reservation through Open Table which was very easy and when we arrived we were immediately seated.\n\nVintners is a little dark for my liking and some people were having trouble reading the menu, so flashlights were provided. Now elder people who are not accustom to reading by flashlight aren't exactly careful with where they shine the light and my friend and I kept getting hit in the eyes with flashlights.\n\nI ordered one of their signature cocktails called the Black Dragon, which was a Blackberry mojito. I forgot how much I disliked drinks with unstrained berries. The seed were rather distracting.\n\nI had the Veal scaloppini with crimmini mushrooms and it was fantastic. For dessert we shared the meyers lemon cheese cake, which was also perfect, along with some 20 year Tawny port.\n\nService was great. Atmosphere was nice other than the flashlights, and it being Thursday there was a DJ playing contemporary club music. The food was fantastic."

Plus you pay 10 times the price of Baja Fresh to eat next to the angriest, saddest people you have ever seen.  And the poor servers are angry, too: I can't think of another reason why they would be so indifferent (at best) and hostile.  The service here is about the worst I've had, anywhere. (Twice now.)  At least at TGI Friday, I imagine the servers care whether you enjoyed your disgusting, chewy calamari.\n\nIf you are forced to stay in Summerlin, either eat at In-N-Out or do yourself a favor and take a taxi in to the strip.

I had prepared myself for the stark realization that the place may be just a victim of huge hype....BUT I WAS PROVED INCREDIBLY WRONG\n\nThe exterior of Vintner Grill makes that place unassuming. In fact, I thought I had the wrong directions until I could see a white gazebo peeking over the wall.\n\nI, as a male, will NEVER use this word to describe anything ever again but the interior was absolutely LUXURIOUS: plush white, accents or red here and there, straight up beautiful. Usually, one would feel uncomfortable but for some reason the decor made me feel...home-y.\n\nThe service was great for having a full house. I got a table to myself at 7:30pm, awesome right? My drink was never left unattended. And my waitress was talkative considering the dinner rush crowd.\n\nLastly, *drumroll* THE FOOD!! *TA-DAH!!*\nTo start things off, I had the margherita flatbread and finished with dry aged ribeye. It was truly a religious experience, the tomatoes and avocado oil made my palate want more instantly. The ribeye could easily rival Craftsteak or Del Frisco, it had a medium/med-high earthiness but not overpowering. I have to admit that I am very partial to blue cheese so the polenta made me extremely happy.\n\nEveryone MUST try Vintner Grille. Another jewel tucked off strip in Summerlin."

This evening we wanted to share the restaurant with our friends who were in town for her 50th birthday. In fact earlier in the week she had rented a cabana and had a wonderful birthday so for that I give them five stars. \n\nThis evening was probably one of the worst experiences we have had at this restaurant ever. I would probably give them one star for rudeness and lack of courtesy but I am giving them three stars because as usual the food was fantastic. \n\nWe made a reservation for 9:45 which is an option on OpenTable. We arrived at the restaurant at 9:40. The minute we were seated, we were told,  by the curt waiter, that we had less than 10 minutes to order our food. We rushed and ordered our food and our bottle of wine. After we received our food we figured that we could take our time and eat and enjoy our dinner and our company at our leisure. Shortly after we received our food the waitstaff started cleaning up the restaurant around us and others hovered giving us the stair down. Our waiter was a bit rigid but did not appear to pressure us. \n\nThe most appalling behavior was by the bartender. Approximately five minutes after we received our food he cranked the music up so offensively loud that we could not hear each other speak. He did this for a few minutes as if to announce \"okay you've been here long enough it's time to go\". \nA few minutes later he did it again. A gentleman from the other table in the restaurant openly voiced his disgust at the behavior. I yelled across the restaurant and announced \"okay we get the message were getting out\".  Most of us still had the majority of food on our plates and half full glasses of wine. My husband was so angry he ordered dessert menus all around the table and ordered another bottle of wine just to let them know that we were there to dine and enjoy our evening regardless of their abhorrent behavior. \n\nI would like to make a suggestion that they not offer a 9:45  reservation as an option if they are going to rush their guests the minute they sit down. The restaurant of this caliber comes with an expectation of a fine dining experience, not 15 minutes at Taco Bell.\n\nThis is the second time we have made a late dinner reservation and the second time we were rushed through our meal. We will think twice before making a late dinner reservation again that is for sure. There are plenty of restaurants in town who are more than happy to take your business and your money at 9:45 PM."

There was no problem getting a reservation a few days before and the service throughout the night was on point.\n\nFirst up for me was the ahi tuna carpaccio. I always expect small portions during restaurant week, but this was pretty large. It was a whole plate of thinly sliced, delicate tuna with a preserved lemon aioli and capers.  Absolutely delicious.\n\nI was all set to order the halibut for my entree but switched to the NY strip after our waiter went on about how amazing it was. The seasoning and flavor of the steak was good but the meat itself was tough. Not prime grade beef at all. But the accompanying potatoes and arugula and port reduction made up for it. Still, if I could go back, I'd order the halibut instead.\n\nThey had three tempting options for dessert but I went with the carrot cake. The presentation was beautiful and the icing was perfectly balanced and the flavor of the cake was excellent. My only complaint was that it was a touch too dense for my liking.

            "review": "Came here for a dinner for a special event.  Overall, Vintner Grill has a sophisticated food menu, with great options for a traditional multi-course meal, or more of a sharing and sampling approach to dining if desired.  I particularly enjoyed the charcuterie and cheese course, with the variety of options in this area of the menu.  Also, the lamb Bolognese pasta course was excellent.\n\nFor a restaurant of this caliber, there were some service missteps, such as:\n*No bread course was offered to our table, even though it appeared to be standard service to all the tables around us.\n*Follow-up was inconsistent from the wait staff, including instances such as:  For long periods in the evening, the wait staff disappeared altogether and we had no service for our table.  We were offered follow-up service for crostini for our charcuterie and cheese course, which never came.  We had cocktails throughout the evening, but our water glasses were empty and not refilled for the duration of the evening.\n\nI like to enjoy dining at a restaurant like this at a comfortable pace, which we were able to do so at Vintner Grill.  There was no pressure to turn over the table, which I appreciated.  However, service for a fairly simple limited course meal ran about 3 hours, much of this attributed to the disappearance of the wait staff.\n\nAll in all, Vintner Grill holds promise if they can address some fundamental service issues."

Our waiter and assistants were very attentive. I ordered the duck ravioli and my brother ordered the portabella turkey burger. The mushroom was ground into the burger and my brother said it was very tasty and fresh. They gave him a side of vegetables since the fries are fried in a fryer with other breaded products (cross contamination). He said the veggies were delicious. I liked my ravioli, the filling of duck was yummy, but the pasta edges of the ravioli seemed a bit hard or undercooked. I also love the bread they serve. I got the pretzel roll and the brioche. My only complaint is they were cold (I think made earlier (or the day before) and then placed in the fridge). I think room temperature or warm would have been much better. And I think at dinner or later lunch, I wouldn't have noticed the coldness. I gave this place a four for my brother's experience on his birthday, and my past visits for dinner."

We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and decided on an appetizer.  In the past, we have ordered cheese plates but we decided to order:\n\n*Crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli ($12)\n\nI wish we didn't order it.  It was rubbery and the aioli had a very strange flavor.  After eating two rings of calamari, I had enough of the rubber.  Surprisingly enough, the waiter never asked how the appetizer was. \n\nBut he did come over to ask what we wanted as a main course.  I'm guessing there weren't any specials of the night, since it was never offered.\n\nI ordered:\n*Seared sea scallops with saffron risotto, english peas, fennel, pea sprouts and roasted pepper relish ($31)\n-The scallops were MASSIVE and very good.  But the risotto tasted like a box of rice-a-roni (yuck!)  The roasted pepper relish that was on top of each scallop was unnecessary as it caused the inside of the scallops to turn pink, which then makes you think, \"could this be raw inside?\"\n\nMy husband ordered:\n*Durham ranch wagyu sirloin with parsnip puree, baby vegetables and balsamic-port reduction ($27)\n-He said it was good, but the wagyu at T-Bones at Red Rock (if you can believe it!) was MUCH better.  In fact any wagyu that he has had anywhere else was better than this.\n\nWe ordered our dessert to go:\nWhich was a trifle with granola, strawberries and pound cake.  It was yummy!\n\nThere are restaurants in the area that have better food; the ambiance at Vintner Grill is terrific- but that is what you are paying for.\n\nUnfortunately, I am no longer a fan and will not be visiting anymore.  Such a shame since I live about five minutes away."

The truffle cheese is to die for, I even considered asking them if I was able to purchase some haha. My favorite entree to get is the prime beef tenderloin with potato pur\u00e9e. It's so juicy and fulfilling. Their lamb bolognese is also delicious, very rich and flavorful. It's also a beautiful restaurant. I definitely look forward to coming back."

It is in a location that can best be sumarized by saying...\"where in the hell?\"  That being said the place was doing just fine, biz wise, on a tuesday night.\n\nI really like this place: it is funky without being weird. I love the distressed floors and the uniuqe decor. That being said it was really dark in there.\n\nWhat really shines at this restaurant is the food. We started with a wonderful bottle of reisling( Dr Loosen?) which was very reasonably priced. We paired that with cheeses( their cheese selection is really really good...think purple haze( mild goats milk cheese with fennel and lavender from my neck of the woods Nor Cal), wonderufl blue cheese, cheedar, and other stinky cheeses. We had with this some wonderful proscutio, sliced duck breast(omg), crustini and some spreads that combined in an amazing way.\n\nWe also had a pizza/ flat bread for our appetizer that was just out of this world: carmelized onions, bits of proscutio, goat cheese that was a symphony of flavor.\n\nEntrees were even better: I had the honey truffle glazed organic chicken that was one of the best I have ever had. I subbed out the mac and cheese for the tuscan potatoes and these mothers were just amazing. \n\nMy dining partners had the petite file which looked and tasted great, and the salmon tangine...which also looked and smelled divine.\n\nThis was all paired with a simple mondavi pinot noir which cost $30...what a bargain.\n\nDesserts were also spot on. The tiramasu was a large portion of chocolate lady fingers( not traditional but very very good) soaked in a wonderful liquour with the usual additions. The apple crisp was also just a smash.\n\nI highly recommend this out of the way jem.Service was also very attentive.\nOh I forgot to mention their bread selections at the beggining were just drop dead amazing. chocolate walnut, etc..and the butter was very very creative.\n\nCheck it out!"

Hostess sent us outside to \"wait\" and it was freaking cold. I came back in 10 min later to ask if we could wait inside or if we can sit where a bar server could take our drink order. She said to go outside. Another 15 minutes...Another inquiry and 15 minutes...Still nobody.  She's like huh? What's your name? As we stood at the front door (because we were cold) with no drink a group of 8 came in asking about the place and if they could eat there etc. or get a reservation to be seated. The hostess said no reservation needed and she could seat them in 5 minutes. Um, hello?  After overhearing this I said that we were still waiting we had a reservation - She goes, \"What's your name again?\"  When I asked how long she said she didn't know.  Observation - LIttle girls who have no people skills shouldn't be working at an establishment without proper supervision.  She then was super confused (why? there was nobody else waiting - she kept seating everyone immediately that came in....)  then said she didn't know if we could get a table yet.. When asked why the party of 6 was able to get seat when they walked in she said they had reservations. LIAR. ...Liar panties on FIRE. I am not sure why the game playing or unorganized servers. But, we sat at the table in the bar area. Food was okay. It was so dark even with my phone light I couldn't read the menu. I observed how this place was working and it seems like those who knew her and she knew their names were getting seated asap. If this is a local \"cheers\" type place that's fine but you have to know I have told over 30 people this story and I haven't told you how bad our waitress was yet....Don't bother wit this place it's just not worth the hassel or your energy fighting to get a popularity button of approval from Miss Thing at the Hostess With the Mostess Station.

It was about a $10 cab ride from the resort. \n\nWe checked in and were seated promptly. It seemed to be a quiet evening which was nice because it was so busy during my last visit. As we were seated our server came by to greet us and get us started on drinks. Our server was so helpful with making recommendations. Always a plus. At that time I informed our server that I am gluten intolerant and then suggested that they would be able to make some modifications and pointed out some menu items that did not have gluten. One of the modifications were the calamari starter sauteed without the breading. It was so flavorful with the right amount of lemon/acid. Gluten intolerant or not, I would have preferred it that way anyway. My BF took full advantage of the bread basket. It was all about the pretzel bread. For our main course, I had the salmon and my BF had the steak. Both of us enjoyed our entrees and my plate did not have one spec left. For dessert, I had cheese and my BF had the tiramisu. As were closing out or bill we informed our server that we would need a cab. As we were walking out the hostess and manager informed us that they had called a cab and we were more than welcomed to wait inside. We waited about 5 minutes for our cab. It was such an nice experience and loved that we really felt the customer service was above average."

We made a reservation, which obviously wasn't necessary because the place was half empty, but that's besides the point. We waited for a good while at the host stand ungreeted (how do you not have a hostess?) until a server came up to seat us. He didn't ask about our reservation but took us to a nice table. Took a while to get water service and the server wasn't super educated on the menu. I had questions about the cocktails and all he could say was \"ya they're good, you'll like it\" and things like that. Don't get me wrong he was very friendly but when cocktails are 15$ and entrees start at 40$ you should have an idea of what you're talking about! other than that the food was delicious and came out in a timely manner. The ambiance was nice and quiet, definitely a great place for a date! Will definitely visit again and hope that their service is a little more on point this time!"

We were celebrating a birthday and I put a note in the message box for Vintners to see so I wouldn't have to do it at the restaurant. I asked twice before we were seated to make sure they checked me in. \n\nWhen we were seated the waiter seemed nice enough. We placed our order which included a cheese plate, hummus and he calamari to start. Right away the waiter was trying to up sell us on every item. I felt like I was at a fast food restaurant. It was very strange. They have never done this here before. All apps were brought out at the same time. So much for enjoying the cheese plate with my nice bottle of Opus One. While we were eating the apps I asked the waiter to please check and make sure they had checked me in on my reservation. He assured me they had.\n\nWe then placed our order for dinner and the BF and I both ordered the bouillabaisse which has been amazing every time we have been here. Of course the waiter did his up sell and offered us a chance to add pasta to it. Sounded okay so we did it. When the bouillabaisse came out I could tell right away something was wrong. The scallops were raw, shrimp was raw and when I took a bite of a mussel it was cold and had the worst metal taste to it. That was it for me, I could not finish it. I could also not get that metal taste out of my mouth. The manager was at my table within seconds and asked me if everything was okay. I told him the problem and he took the dish away. The BF continued to pick at his. But eventually had to give up as his was raw too. Before we could tell the manager, the bus boy came by and took it away.\n\nThe waiter came by to let me know he had removed the entire dish from my bill. I would expect him to remove the entire dish since it was raw. He acted put out like he was dong me a favor. After he cleaned the table, I could tell that they did not see my note about the birthday so I asked for the check. They did not remove the BF's meal which I found to be rude. We paid the check and left. On my way out, I asked the hostess again if she had checked me in, she said yes. This really angered me, if they had checked me in, they would have noticed the birthday note.\n\nWhen I got home I received an email from Open Table that Vintners had cancelled my reservation. You have got to be kidding me!! What a joke. I called the manager and basically he said all he could do was apologize. Apology not excepted.\n\nWithin an hour of getting home we both became very sick with food poisoning. All night long we were very sick and still not feeling well tonight. Vintners should be ashamed of themselves! We will never be returning. This place has really gone downhill."

It wasn't bad enough that I'm never going back but it definitely didn't live up to the dining experience I was expecting.  \n\nPlusses:  Great bar menu, drinks and service.  I'm definitely going back there for drinks.  (Awesome people watching)\n\nMinuses:  Dinner was so-so.  My biggest complaint was the pace of service.  I love a well paced meal but I also like a little attention.  We'd go for 30 minutes at a time without even so much as water top off.  When your water class sits empty (and you've paid for the Voss), that's a sign that they aren't interested.  BTW, I would have pored it myself but they keep the bottles off the table.\n\nThey have DJ on Thursday evenings.  Which actually is kind of cool but I wasn't prepared for it and it got a little loader than I was expecting for a \"romantic\" dining experience."

I have experienced rude and generally poor service from the wait staff here the past two times I've eaten here. The service at this place ruins the dining experience completely, thus the one star rating.\n\nBoth times I ate there with my girlfriend, who happens to be very attractive. (Forgive me for having good taste, not only when it comes to food). The first time we went, we sat down and waited about 10 minutes for a menu. Our supposed waiter was nowhere to be found by the hostess until we pointed him out to her- he was attending to a large party, taking his time, making jokes and completely ignoring us- he would periodically walk by our table, checking out my girlfriend and not saying anything. Just walking by silently staring. I noticed this at least 3 times- it was creepy and annoying.\n\nOur order was taken by a 'temp server' who promised the actual server would take over- he didn't. Our food was placed on the table by two different servers/bussers. Out 'server' came by at the last minute to 'check' on us, as if he had been waiting on us the entire time, but that was toward the end of the meal- evidently to ensure we tipped him well as we were almost finished dining. \n\nAt the time he stopped by my girlfriend, an avid instagrammer was taking a picture of her food. (I don't partake in such activities but who am I to judge?) He made some corny joke about her taking a picture of him and framing it on her wall to which I replied 'I think we're good'. The whole experience was very confusing, awkward, and unprofessional. \n\nWe decided to try this place out one more time yesterday, went in with an open mind, hoping for a better dining experience with a different waiter. Even though our waiter was different, the experience was even worse. I don't know if our waiter had something going on personally, or maybe we didn't 'fit in' because we were wearing casual clothing and were younger than everyone else in the place, (it was about 95  degrees on a Monday afternoon- no way I'm not wearing shorts) but he was very rude as he approached us, didn't smile once, and took our order as if he would've rather been anywhere in the world but in front of us doing what he is being paid to do- mumbling and generally half-assing his way through taking our order. \n\nWhen I asked if I could substitute brown rice instead of mac and cheese he snapped at me saying that 'we don't have brown rice', and didn't offer any suggestions, until I asked him to suggest what other alternatives they had.  I should also mention that both me and my girlfriend are very polite people and both greeted him nicely and were polite the entire time.\n\nOnly after I sternly told him that we were in a hurry and to put a rush on the order, did he start acting more polite. \n\nOnce again, great food, horrible service. But maybe you'll be fine if you're older and wearing a collared shirt."

He told me to remove my phone off the table as he gave me my plate of food. I thought it was rude to speak to a customer that way. I should give a 1 star for that. The food was great especially the lamb so that added one more star. Just don't get Jeff as your server."

It is the strangest location for some of the best food in Las Vegas.  Pleasant interior and wonderful service -- so friendly and helpful.  The crab cake appetizer has been described as perfect -- and it is.  We had wonderful salads and flatbread.  Now for the desserts.  The carmelized apple tart was topped with granola and oatmeal, caramel sauce and vanilla bean gelato.  Delicious!  The maple brulee with lavender cookies and berries was also amazing.  We will be returning there during our visit because there are so many dishes we want to try.  Our server was Wendy.  Such an asset to the place.  She actually walked us to the door as we visited."

It is tucked away in a business center and from the outside looks pretty normal... then, upon walking inside it turns into a decadent world with beautiful decor and a pristine ambiance of light color and mellow serendipity.  The menu feature a fresh cheese, app/dinner, and wine page.... simple, yet copious flavors from every dish, attentive waiter and great atmosphere made this place a 5 of 5.  Dinner for two with a good bottle for about $100 isn't too bad at all."

The service was lovely and although my boss is a regular there, I really do believe the service would be excellent all the time. The assortment of breads was lovely while we sipped our wine and I loved the unique options on the menu. I had scallops and corn risotto and my mouth waters just remembering it. The presentation was clean and the dish was memorably flavorful. \n\nWhat I loved and hope to take advantage of next time is the outdoor cabanas. There are wonderful areas to enjoy happy hour with friends or evening drinks when it's nice out. While we sat inside, the ambiance is still nice with low lighting, but a nice atmosphere, not stuffy, that still makes you feel like you can enjoy yourself."

Our requests were reasonable and have been accommodated by other fine dining establishments with no issues - but it was problematic for the staff at this venue to have 20 folks coming in to to buy drinks all at once. This is the first bar I've encountered where having separate tabs open for a medium number of  patrons is considered too difficult a task. I thought the purpose of bars was to sell drinks - but this, for the folks at Vintner, is apparently too much work. \n\nAs a result I will not be patronizing this establishment further. Crazy that a place would turn down business because there is work involved in serving customers."

The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.

It's the perfect balance between feminine & masculine touches. I've been here many times & the only complaint I have is that sometimes the service can lack (when there's large parties). This has happened to us several times. What's great about the service here is that usually the waiter knows things are backed up & that's when a complimentary starter or dessert will pop up. It's always appreciated. \n\nLet's get to the food. I've tried nearly everything & I love it, especially my mans NY strip that comes with crispy potatoes (crispy perfection) and balsamic reduction drizzled over everything. Hands down one of the best items on the menu. The portion is massive so ladies just have a few bites from your partner. I typically order the scallops which always change a little depending on what is in season (it's always delicious). And we never skip starting with the cheese. They have a wide selection and it always comes with a side of jam (this one happened to be apple cinnamon) amazing! Don't skip the cheese...\n\nThere's also a beautiful outdoor space that you should take advantage of when the evening weather is nice. It feels like you're in another world and its the perfect sunset dining moment. \n\nIf you haven't been here yet it's an absolute must. Make a reservation because evenings are always busy here."

The manager took our jacket and offered to find a reputable leather dry cleaner to clean the jacket.  We did not hear anything back for more than 3 weeks, so my husband called, and was told by the same manager that he was going to call the dry cleaners that day after 2 pm to see if the jacket was ready, and he would call my husband back after that to come and pick it up.  Needless to say, we heard nothing, so my husband called late afternoon the next day, and the manager told him the jacket was there to pick up, but yet never called to let my husband know he had the jacket.  He told my husband he could come and get it that day or the next day which was Sunday after 4 pm.  I was very sick that day, so my husband went the next day after 4 pm and the manager was not there, but the jacket was not dry cleaned properly, and in fact was ruined by some sort of agent put on it to clean it, it hardened the the leather.  My husband refused to take it, and said he wanted to speak to the owner.  the owner never called so I went to see the manager, after I spoke to someone else who told me they would take care of me, if we gave the restaurant another chance, and that the manager was his boss, and he told him about this.  When I got to the restaurant the manager told me he had never heard anything from this other person, and when I confronted the person, he lied saying he never told me such a thing.  Needless to say, that the manager said he would speak to the owner and get back to me first thing the next morning, and they could possible go and buy another jacket, or give me the money to buy another one.  I did not hear back from the manager nor the owner, therefore I called late that evening, and was told the manager would call me back in 10 mins.  The manager called me back in approximately 2 hours, and said they could not do anything, they have already done all they are going to do, and I could either come and pick up the jacket or they can mail it to me.  I told them I never want to step in their restaurant again, after being a good customer for so many years, referring so many people there, having office parties there, birthday parties there, and being treated so badly, to just go ahead an mail it to me."

What an awesome restaurant, I feel it really gives competition to some of the on strip's restaurants that I've been to such as Nine, Fix, Stacked, etc.  \nThe overall d\u00e9cor is modern & clean, lots of whites and turquoise/blues.  It's too bad it was a cold night because they have a really nice patio area with cabanas and fire pits, etc. but just a reason to go back when it warms up.  Our server was Josh and he took care of us!  His recommendations were spot on too.  There were 3 of us and we wanted to try a few things and shared family style.  The bread they bring you is fun: lots of choices like pretzel bread, black & green olive breads, cranberry, etc. and their butter/olive oil dip was yummy.  For appetizers we did their mix of cheese, salumi and fruit/jellies.  We stuck to the ones we knew like fontina, smoked cheddar and tried a goat's cheese purple haze that was quite good and not too strong.  Their Caesar salad is one of a kind, wrapped in prosciutto with the whole romaine heart and the dressing is really good.  I also had their butter lettuce salad with Brie and an orange/balsamic which was very good.   They had a parsnip soup on the menu that was quite good.  Their prosciutto flatbread was good, but we sent it back to get a little crispier.  Their NY Steak with Yukon potatoes and a port reduction was a good portion for all 3 of us to share along with all the other food and was cooked perfectly, only thing I would have asked for was more of a sauce on the side.  The best part was dessert: blueberry meyer lemon cheesecake.  WOW, this cheesecake was so airy and soft with the perfect tartness of blueberry compote and lemon, I had to make room for this!  Overall this place is a must for that special occasion or just to treat yourself!"

People were running around, our waiter forgot to put in our drinks, and our we had to ask another guy to take our order. However, like I said-- the food made it all worth it. \n\nFor apps we had: pork belly, and the cherry tomatoes--- both SUPER!\n\nFor entrees we had: half chicken with Mac and cheese (husband)---so moist and the Mac and cheese wasn't overpowering. I had the flat iron steak and it was delicious with some kind of tomato/chimichurri sauce over it. My friend had the osso bucco and risotto and I think that may have been my favorite. It had this great fall flavor like cinnamon almost (probably from the fennel that made it the perfect fall dish. I kept sneaking bites...:-)"

When the waiter came by, we ordered a bottle of spanish wine (Tempranillo).   Now I don't claim to be a wine connoisseur, but I know what I like to drink but am willing to keep an open mind when a recommendation is made.  So we listened when the waiter recommended a red zinfendel instead, but thought it was strange since he threw out the recommendation without getting a sense of what we planned to order.  We decided against his recommendation, and that's when he began to insult our wine selection claiming it was too earthy (we ordered a tempranillo....ummmm they're supposed to be earthy).  I was not happy with this behavior, but my friend figured there must be a reason, and maybe we should at least give the zin a taste.  So we asked if we could taste the Zin before committing to a bottle.  Our waiter came back with an unopened bottle and 2 glasses, we had only asked for a tasting.  So we made it clear to him again, that we only wanted to taste the wine, and we didn't want him to open the bottle because we weren't sure if we wanted a bottle of Zinfindel.  He assured us that it would be no problem and he was certain we would like the Zinfindel.  Well....we tried it....and I'm sure other people like Zinfindel's, but this one was extremely dry and tart.  My friend and I looked at each other and knew this was not what we wanted.  So we told the waiter, we'd like to stick with the Tempranillo.  Our waiter looked really upset,  after that he brought us our original selection but didn't seem very amicable.  It made the atmosphere and dining experience awkward, which we didn't want.  He seemed a little friendlier later on, but dealing with wine issue was not pleasant.  We were sitting near the register and noticed that they were selling a lot of Zinfindel....so maybe they were trying to get rid of a case.\n\nFood:  \nThe quality of the food was not consistent. Here's the breakdown, out of 5:\nCheese plate - 5 \nGoat cheese/hazelnut salad - 5 - paired different flavors that worked really well together\nscallops -  2  - too salty and there was some sand on the scallops so it ended up having a grainy taste; I couldn't finish it\nBeef Tenderloin - 2 - my friend ordered this and he didn't seem too enthusiastic about his plate either, he also didn't finish his plate.\nBlueberry Lemon cheesecake - 5\n\n\nThis isn't a restaurant on the Strip, but it's not cheap either.  We paid $165 for 2 with tip, and overall the level of service and food quality were not on par to what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber."

I must have driven by this place a hundred times and never knew it was there until a friend recommended it to me. It was a last minute decision to eat there when my date said I could pick anywhere, so I did.  Reservations were made on the Yelp site (easy as pie) 2 hours before our arrival last Saturday with no problem. There's a nice ambiance to the place.  There's an outdoor area complete with heaters and a large fire pit.  Inside, there are comfortable chairs and ottomans for the diners waiting for a table. A classic James (Sean Connery) Bond movie was playing on the flat screens with the sound off in the dining area-I thought it was kinda cool.  For starters, we had the chevre goat cheese.  Good stuff!  My only complaint would be that we needed more of the toast that was served with the cheese because we only got three pieces.  The bread service was interesting with a server coming to the table with a platter of different selections for you to choose from and doling out pieces as requested.  I didn't realize the butter for the bread was on the table because of the dim lighting; it looked like a rectangular plate with two different kinds of olive oil.  In actuality, it was a slab of butter with two scoops created for the olive oil.  Of the bread selections, I went with a pretzel-like one and the wheat rolls; I'd rather have the bread warm, but no big deal.  We had the crab cakes appetizer, one for each of us and they were good.  By the time my actual entree came, the Free Range Half Chicken with Mac n Cheese, I was kind of full.  I only ate a quarter of the chicken, but all of the mac n cheese, which was just okay.  Our waiter was fairly attentive throughout the meal and then he disappeared at the end.  Overall, it was a nice dining experience in a cool space.  I'd definitely recommend it for a special occasion."

In the last year, everything has changed for the worst. I most recently went in for a light drink and a meal at the bar. Yvette treated me very well. Cue to the end of my meal. Patrick the manager was at the bar drinking and decided to butt into a conversation I was having with another patron at the bar. Patrick was rude. Insulted me. And made me feel ashamed of myself. I spent $150 on my meal for myself but he decided to berate me on my female opinion because he disagreed on something in a conversation between me and another patron unrelated to him. I have never felt so disrespected in my life. As a young professional Vegas female, I will ensure all professional women know that only men are respected at this restaurant or women who are taken care of by their men. Do not come here if you are an independent woman who just wants a nice meal. I am so disappointed. Especially because everything was great until the drunken manager came around. Sorry I will be taking my $150 elsewhere next time. I'm sure you all really don't care about that though. Thank you Patrick, for making me feel stuck in the 1950s despite my hard work. You have definitely lost me and I will continue to report this behavior to everyone I know. And by the way he said \"bye Felicia\" to me which may be effective for a 12 year old but definitely ensures this professional woman will never come back."

It's always fun to try new flavors and wow your taste buds. My wife had the stroganoff.  It was ok.  The problem is, if you're going to put stroganoff on your menu, it better be fantastic!  Meat was ok, noddles were overdone, sauce was \"just like mama makes.\"  \n\nI had the lamb, which was incredible.  Someone will have to explain to me the culinary technique of cooking Brussels sprouts so they are warm but really hard to chew... To me that says under cooked.  No room for dessert this time.  \n\nOverall good visit, but I think next time it will be cheese tray and dessert.

We both also thoroughly enjoyed our desserts. \n\nI've seen a few people complain about service here which comes off a little.... pretentious. If you want to be waited on hand and foot and treated like a snoody tourist, then go have dinner on the strip. But if you want to be treated like a local and gather a sense of belonging to the Summerlin community, go to Vintner and treat your wait staff with the same friendly attitude that you would your neighbor. If you don't get that same down to earth, familiar attitude back, then leave your 'vindicating' 1 star review and don't return. The rest of us will enjoy it."

Some of the sitting areas are close to the fire pit, while others are more secluded and would provide some privacy if that's what you are looking for. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is also really elegant and nice. It reminds me of an upscale restaurant in Miami because of the predominately white furnishings. \n\nFood here is fresh and made with care. The standouts I can recall are: \n-The bread and butter for the table is amazing. \n-Cheese and cured meat platter - You choose from a list of meats and cheeses, including their in-house homemade cheeses (if available), and they serve it with dried fruits and jams. \n-Lamb ribs appetizer is delicious quite a large portion for an appetizer.\n-Octopus - Perfectly grilled and seasoned as a salad. \n-Pork Belly - who doesn't like thick cut bacon?\n-Beets with Lavender Goat Cheese - Love floral in food! \n\nI would certainly come back anytime for a glass of wine and appetizers with good friends."

Vitner's Grill is soooo pretty, the kind of pretty that calls one hither while simultaneuosly arousing rebellion. Like the need to stare at the cutest girl in class, only to pull her braids when she's not looking. So too should Vintner's be admired and dissed simultaneously.      \n \nSo don't let the swank deter you, have fun with it. Enjoy the crisp and well-thought out decor that gives a nouveu nod to Nantucket. Dress well, but do expose a few of your tattoo's to let em know the counter-culture has arrived and wants a damn good table.There's that yank of the braids I was talking about.  FYI, The Summerlin set responds quickly to any threat that there neighborhood may be infultrated by upstarts. For great service, it pays to walk in with a little edgyness. Like hanging some golden nunchuks from your designer bag, etc  \n\nNow, back to food \n\nVG boasts a balanced wine list, with many good Napa Valley choices, albeit small pours. Wood fired pizza with artisanal cheese was on point. We also enjoyed the butter and olive oil chilled on a marble slab to accompany the bread service and a dynamite salad. I tend toward the subject matter found in a renaissance still life; cheese, wine, bread, fruit, olives~ cannot  speak to meat options on menu, but what veg we had was quite good and very fresh.\n\nVT is a nice option if you wish to avoid the strip, but are seeking some Luxe ambiance for business or pleasure. Nice place for plen-air dining on torch-lit patio. Salut!"

It is connected to an office building inside a professional park, not where you'd typically find a restaurant.  However, if you work in one of the many office buildings nearby, it is probably very convenienct.   The food was ok - not bad by any stretch but a little overpriced.   The atmosphere is very upscale and we saw a few local Vegas celebrities eating lunch at the same time."

However, don't worry, you won't be confronted with office cubicles and fluorescent lights once inside. Inside reminds me a bit of Encore-style, although not quite as exquisitely executed. French Country meets South Beach was the verdict my gal pal and I issued. The floor is a beautiful faded painted wood. The predominant color is white, so the feeling is very airy and clean. It gets my vibe stamp of approval, especially the outdoor area with lanterns and a fire pit which I had my eyes on. They also have a private room. \n\nLots of men in suits eat lunch at Vintner, so I am going to say that it is a respectable choice for a \"power\" lunch. My friend and I were there for more of an intricate lunch, the kind where girls order a lot of food, a couple of drinks and eat really slow while pondering. We should do this more often. \n\nI found their clipboard menus odd, but I guess that showcases their commitment to changing it often. The menu has salads, flatbreads, focaccias, sandwiches, a couple of fish entrees and then some usual suspects. If you like cheese, this would be a good place for you, as they have an extensive selection for a custom cheese plate. I wouldn't say service was the most attentive, but it was pleasant. When my friend accidentally threw her drink across the table, our server was quick on her feet, and she graciously brought a replacement. Lost vodka would have been a tear-jerker for sure. \n\nThe bread basket is a nice selection, including a pretzel roll, but I was surprised that all of the bread was cold. Is that a new thing? Am I unsophisticated expecting warm bread? I am asking in seriousness because I have noticed it at a couple of places. \n\nWe started with a flavorfun crab cake. There was a lot going on in the crab cake, but that is what made it both flavorful and fun. It wasn't jumbo lump meat, but I still ate it in under a minute. I had a turkey burger, which was a little dry even for turkey, but filled with herbs. The bun was wholesome. It came with little, thin French fries. I appreciated them because they allowed me to eat numerous fries without feeling like a complete glutton. My friend's Cobb salad looked nice, but it wasn't a showstopper. \n\nWe finished with the strawberry shortcake, and this is a sleeper. It is not a real decadent dessert, but the flavors are scrumptious. The strawberries were just a bit tart; the whipped cream was not heavy; the biscuit tasted like cake, and the balsamic reduction was not overpowering.\n\nI would say the food is hovering between 3 and 4 stars, but the atmosphere and culinary effort bumps it up to a 4 star for now. I will be back just to make sure. Maybe I will wear a suit."

In fact it's literally hidden among office buildings and I would never have been able to find it if it wasn't for the reviews.\n\nI made reservations for Christmas dinner and was surprised to find the place was happening that night. I've never gone out for Christmas dinner before, so I was worried that it was going to be super dead. As soon as we were seated, a server came around with a tray full of bread. There were a bunch of different kinds, pretzel, brioche, olive, wheat and my favorite cranberry bacon. The breads were served with rosemary and sun dried tomato infused oils and salted butter. My only complaint was that the breads were not warm and the server only came around once. Not that I needed any more bread, but had they come again, I probably would have taken one (or many) more of the bacon cranberry.\n\nMy mom and I decided to make a meal out of several apps. We started out with the butter lettuce salad and calamari. The butter lettuce salad was very good with a triangle of gooey fried brie. I thought the calamari was okay - not the best I've ever had, but I liked the curry aioli. Next up was the pumpkin gnocchi. The gnocchi itself was a bit sweet, but was offset nicely by the salty prosciutto and crunchy hazelnuts. We managed to only eat half of our flatbread with caramelized leeks, roasted garlic and chili. It made nice left overs for the next day. My grandma had the bouillabaisse which was full of mussels, shrimps, and scallops. I'm not a big seafood eater, but I this was delicious and the broth was so good sopped up with the pesto toasts.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed, but had to try dessert. The 3 of us split a huge tiramisu served in a mug. It was probably one of the best tiramisus I've ever had - not too sweet. We barely managed to make a dent in it!\n\nThe service was excellent and we were well taken care of all night. Prices were pretty reasonable too.  It's nice to find a great restaurant away from the craziness of the strip."

            "review": "I heard rave reviews of this restaurant and being a culinary student I thought it would be fun to go check it out. \n\nI'll start with the good, because it's very limited. The ambiance was lovely. The restaurant is beautifully designed. It screams elegance and luxury. Our main waiter was very attentive and the service flowed smoothly apart from the water catastrophe of 2013... \n\nFor some reason the assisting waiter boggled the water 10+ times. We ordered a bottle of sparkling and a bottle of still. He poured people the wrong kind of water over and over again, even at times mixing two types of water. Of course, it was just water, but it distracted from the experience. \n\nOn to the food.. what a nightmare! \n\nRookie mistakes were prevalent from the moment I ordered my salad. I ordered the Treviso Caesar Salad wrapped in Prosciutto with egg and regianno. It was 5-6 awkwardly wrapped, soggy pieces of romaine so soaked in dressing it could have been comparable to a soup. Taking any basic Garde Manger class will teach you that if there's salad dressing left on the plate, or in the bowl, there is too much. I also don't appreciate being served huge, awkward to eat pieces of food. There is nothing elegant about trying to slice up soggy lettuce and scoop it into your mouth. Food should be easy to eat, bottom line. I also have a sneaking suspicion the eggs were canned, hard boiled quail eggs. They had that rubbery feel that's unique to canned eggs. In a fine dining establishment that is just unacceptable. \n\nOn to the entrees.. \n\nBefore I rip my entree apart I want to point something out. It's St. Patrick's day and the restaurant was running a special.. Kobe Corned Beef.. there are so many things wrong with that I don't even know where to begin. Kobe beef is appealing because of the smooth texture and heavy marbling. That's what makes Kobe beef special! Corned beef is generally made from brisket, which has a low fat content and requires long, slow cooking to break the meat down and make it tender. It is boiled, in water so all of the fat cooks out of the meat. Why would someone ever take Kobe beef, and completely ruin it? Think about what you're paying for people! I've seen this done on menus several times, people see \"Kobe beef\" and immediately go to \"expensive\" in their head. Well, it is VERY expensive, and you're paying for someone to complete ruin everything that makes it great. My father ordered it and it was extremely dry and unpleasant. \n\nI ordered the beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie mashed potatoes, and asparagus. When I got my plate the first thing I noticed is that the plate was cold, when you plate sauce underneath a protein on a cold plate, the sauce gets cold. Hot meat, cold sauce. Horrible mouth feel. The tenderloin itself was unimpressive and a little on the dry side. The seasoning was off and I found myself needing salt. The worst foul on the plate however had to be the mashed potatoes. They we lumpy, not creamy, clearly the potatoes did not cook long enough or you wouldn't get that \"chunky\" feel in your mouth. They also should have been strained. This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment. At $40 a portion, they need to take the extra time to elevate every aspect of a dish! \n\nMy brother ordered the sirloin, it was topped with some sort of compound butter. I didn't taste it, but I saw the plate. The massive glob of butter was sitting on top of the meat completely solid. The point of topping meat with any sort of butter is for it to melt and create almost a sauce and a flavoring element to enrich the beef. \n\nAll in all I have to say this is one of the worst fine dining experiences I've ever had. The food is mediocre and tries to hard to be \"special\" by using ingredients and cuts that are expensive. It doesn't matter how expensive the cut of meat was if you ruin it, and it certainly doesn't matter if you top a salad with truffle oil that lends nothing to the dish. I would not eat at this restaurant again. It is a complete joke and I'm sure it will still do just fine. The fancy atmosphere and menu ingredients will always lure in the yuppies who think they're some sort of culinary authority. Think about what you're paying for and demand better."

My GF and I have a very lengthy list of quality off the strip restaurant...just this weekend we took out her mom for dinner. Her mom's choice was Vintner Grill in Summerlin, definitely not a restaurant of our liking.\nWe made reservations for 7:30, when we got there the place was a quarter occupied.  That should have been our sign to walk out.  Here's the summary of our night:\n* It took almost 15 mins for someone to finally come over our table and offer drink\n* Typically restaurants will have off the menu specials when we asked the waiter was very short and rude\n* Drinks took another 15 mins and while the waiter took our order he spilled half of my cocktail on the table.  Did he offer to move us to a difference table or change the table cloth??? NO WAY, instead he quickly said \"sorry\" and took off to the kitchen.  \n* I thought he would return with a new drink, to my surprise he returned with the appetizers we had order. \n* Appetizers really sucked, my Italian wedding soup was very salty.  \n* My GF got a burnt steak for dinner, her mom's raviolis were OK\n* The Tiramisu basically had a giant thick hard/old brownie in the middle\nBetween drinks and food the bill was about $300, I was so pissed off that my tip to the waiter was \"better service\". \nOn our way out we looked for the manager to let him know of the poor service, but saw that he was too busy chatting up the hostess in a corner.  Probably trying to line up his date/quickie for the night. \nTIP: don't come here.  I wish I had read the reviews.  We all agreed this place is permanently a NO GO"

I don't know why but I feel like the bread sets your first impression of the food. The waiter that served our bread had a stone cold face. He looked like he did not want to be there. Our bread was cold and hard. Tears of disappointment...\nThe butter had crushed peppers and another with basil (I think) with oil. The butter had the consistency of chalk :(\n\n Our waiter who took our order was bright and nice. He was glad to help us with our choices. \n\nFirst off, I ordered the lamb bolognese. It was very heavy. The ratio of lamb to pasta was unbalanced. There was twice the amount of lamb to pasta. I ended up putting some lemon juice and it was a lot better. \n\nThe crab ravioli was cooked very well, but the filling was nehhh.

My husband and I have tried almost every dish on their menu and everything is just excellent!\nI have always had excellent servers. I chose to dine here again for our anniversary. However we did not have a good service this visit and its all because of our server, Scott. He is very serious, no smile, no customer service of any kind. I hope the restaurant can take a note of his terrible manners. I would surely return to dine here but would always put in a request \"please do not keep us on Scott's table\"\nI would give 5 stars to this place for the food and ambiance but I have to rate it 3 for the poor quality of service."

We went here for my wife's bday and it was a blast. We scored the cool patio tent which made for an excellent evening outside with the Vegas heat cooling down (yet after a few glasses of wine you get heated up again) Word on the patio tent is first come first serve, or if you need it guaranteed for your dinner plans, plan to drop $1000 min to secure it. Otherwise anywhere else in the restaurant is still a nice experience. We were here on a sat night and to our surprise we got to enjoy a really cool band set up next to our tent. It was a very nice chillaxin vibe with good food and good company. \nThe food was excellent and expect to pay 25 - 30+ for entrees. The only problem I had was with the initial reservation. I had called and made the reservation on a Tuesday, for a Saturday evening dinner. Luckily I called a few hours ahead to confirm reservations because they had no record of it!!!!! If I remember correctly, the initial girl I spoke with seemed really distracted taking my reservation and answering my questions, almost sounded annoyed. I was really disappointed with this. But luckily the nice girl who I spoke with the day of our reservation assured me she could fit us in and even made sure we scored the tent when we arrived. Much thanks for that. I forgot your name but you were the pretty, sexy, black girl with short hair at the front! The whole staff that night was pretty busy but still accommodating. The food, service and overall experience was great."

I tried several dishes but my favorite is the Mediterranean Sea Bass and the cheese plate.  Any cheese is delicious here...\n\nThe waitstaff and ambiance is great.  Every time I have a visitor come in from out of town this is one of the first place I take them.  They love it!!!"

A sexy, romantic, beautiful atmosphere, with soft music, gas fire pit, sofa seating. Oh and the food is Exceptional! Menu is sessional additions but listed below are always on the menu. \n\nMust try: \n-Cheese and meat boards. (They make their own cheese)\n-Pizza flat breads. The burrata one is bomb\n-The pan seared scallops \n-Braised Lamb Osso bucco (even if you don't like lamb) best dish ever! \n-The Beet salad. YUM!!"

Whether sitting at the bar having a cocktail and an appetizer, or sitting for a meal and a bottle of wine.  I simply love this place.  The atmosphere is fantastic, the menu is great for both food and wine/cocktails.  The bartenders are social and great at their jobs.  I tend to go here at least a few times a month and have for years."

The ambiance of the place is unique with a very cool vibe (you'll just have to see it).  Their extensive cheese and wine selection can make for a long enjoyable dining experience.  We had a party of 5 and ordered two cheese plates with Stilton, Purple Haze, Humbolt Fog, Gruye, and White Cheddar.  All were delicious.  The starter crab cakes and hummus were excellent.  I don't plan to ever visit this restaurant without getting the crab cakes and hummus.  As an entr\u00e9e, I loved the scallops and also got to try the veal which was awesome.  The service was excellent.  Overall, this restaurant is one of the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas."

It's one of the birthday or anniversary spots in the rotation.\n\nFood and service are always on point.  There are some newer places in Summerlin that are as good, if not better now and are definitely more reasonable than Vintner Grill.   \n\nSo I think Vintner needs to step it up some and come strong with some new menu items.  The menu has been pretty consistent since we've been going there for many years.   A change of pace and cost that is more in line with some of the other fine dining establishments in Summerlin would serve them well.\n\nNotice that the review is still 5 stars though, because it is a fine restaurant and there is something to be said about consistency.  I would just like to see them take some chances and spruce up the menu some."
