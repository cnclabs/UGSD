I asked a server (Maki-San) if we have to write our name again, but she squeezed us into the next spot. \n\nTheir ramen and fried rice was pretty good. None of my friends were picky about ramen, and seemed they were pretty much satisfied with the dishes. \n\nI'm deducting a star because toppings were bit overpriced (my friend was fussing over the price of seaweed). However, as an overall experience, I prefer here over Sora."

Get a pork belly bowl for $4 if you're worried about not being full enough and/or you're feeling like an animal."

However, I keep coming back for more since this is pretty much the only legitimate ramen shop that I know of in the Las Vegas Valley area.\n\nI usually order the miso ramen with nitamago, shredded green onions, and corn (sometimes I go wild and order butter too).  The broth is on the fattier side, and is rich and nutty.  Overall, this is a good bowl of ramen.\n\nService is friendly and quick and their streamlined menu captures all the quintessential components of your basic ramen shop."

I was finally able to try this place that has lines every time I had passed by. \n\nTonkotsu ramen - 3 star. It was good, salty, but nothing super extraordinary. I didn't find it to be amazing, and have definitely had better ramen elsewhere...in Cali and Tokyo. \n\nKuro ramen- 3.5 star. This was richer in flavor and had depth that was different compared to the tonkotsu, but I sure wasn't raving about it either. \n\nKimchi fried rice- 2.5. I was looking forward to this since people had mentioned that it's quite amazing. Nah. I shoulda known better ordering kimchi fried rice at a ramen shop for one, and a Japanese restaurant. \n\nOverall it's a 3 star. An A-OK for me. I don't think I'll be back here again. Oh, but I am proud that the food here got me to drink two big glasses of water."

The prices were great. I ordered the Kuro ramen and my friend ordered the Tonkatsu ramen. I think our bill was only $15 and we couldn't split it with our cards because there was a $10 minimum, no big deal though. My ramen was okay, but the broth was little too salty for me.

            "review": "We love us some good ramen and Monta Ramen was that!  A couple of weeks ago we spent the weekend out in Vegas and this was our top destination :)\n\nWe ordered the tradition tonkotsu ramen ($6.95) as well as the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen ($6.95).  Both were good but the tradition tonkotsu was what really caught our attention. The broth was really good. Smooth, creamy and a tad salty.  \n\nThe noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted great.\n\nThe meat was also above average. Tender with a good amount of fat.  \n\nWe also added an egg to our bowls and we were so glad we did. It was cooked correctly with the right amount of creaminess to it.\n\nIt's the best ramen we've had since our trip back from japan.\n\nIn addition to the ramen bowls, we ordered a mini pork belly bowl which was good enough to steal our attention from the ramen. The pork belly was thinly cut, which makes it a lot easier to eat with the rice. It's a great side to order if you visit.\n\nAs for the staff they were friendly, maybe a little bit overwhelmed. The cook didn't look happy at all for some reason but he was still churning out some great food so we can't complain!\n\nOverall we would recommend trying this place out. Even in 110 degree weather, it's was oishii! (delicious in japanese)"

I mean..if you're looking for delicious Asian food in the Chinatown area....get the Ramen.\n\nSo the advantage about being in this line was getting to order first when they opened. Everything good to go! Fresh Fresh!\n\nIt did not disappoint. \n\n[Food]\nSpicy Tonkotsu Ramen. Hit the spot so good.The menu is actually really simple and has 2 main pages. \n\n[Location]\nRamen house. Bar side and few tables. Slightly tight inside but that's what I like. More authentic. I can see it getting packed in the heavier hours.\n\nThis is like Shinsingumi good. The broth is so rich....and the pork melted in my mouth! The egg noodles were firm and plump.

During those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of Japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.\n\nThe ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is FAR from authentic. \n\nThe broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.\n\nThe biggest difference is the price. Here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?\n\nBack in downtown Iwakuni a bowl of ramen, a side of goyza, and a plate of kimchi fried rice was only about 700ish yen back in 2006ish. Who would have figured five years later i'd pay double the cash to have a sixteenth a meal..."

It is tender and flavorful.\n- Their gyoza is pan fried, but I prefer deep fried.\n- The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's too small & claustrophobic.\n- There's almost always a wait for a table unless you go during off-peak hours.\n- Once you get seated, the service is pretty good.\n- I thought it was a little strange that when I ordered ramen to go, I was told that the noodles were not cooked & that I had to boil them myself. This sucked because the whole reason I order take out is because I don't feel like cooking or don't have time to cook. So having to boil the noodles myself kinda defeats the purpose."

We got the last table before a wait line started so we were excited. \nOrdered right away and our food came out promptly. I got the spicy ramen-it was soooo perfect, I almost cried into my broth. I added an egg and roasted seaweed and once mixed all together, the perfect creamy, broth met with my taste buds and my insides screamed with joy. It was perfection. My husband ordered the tonkatsu ramen with butter and that was just as yummy. Daughter ordered the miso broth and she devoured it. We shared an order of the gyozas and they were pan fried pillows of deliciousness. \n\nIt's really cozy in there, as in, get ready to wait.  There's about 6 tables, and bar seating. \nThis place exceeded my expectations. I'm already dreaming about what I'm going to get next when we come back into town. So yum!"

I was a little doubtful when I first came, but this place is legit!\n\nThey have four different broths (Tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu-shoyu)  I've tried three of the four, but I have to say that the tonkotsu is my favorite!\n\nThere's definitely a pork flavor, rich and soothing.  The soup is steaming when it comes out, but it makes it taste even better!  The pork they have is a little thinner than I would've preferred (due to the fragility when picking the meat up with chopsticks) but it's still so delicious.  I had my tonkotsu with the garlic mash that they have and a soft-boiled egg.  Perfect for a winter day!  The soup is great by itself, but every new topping that is added just gives more depth.\n\nI found that the broth gets saltier the longer it sits.  =(  It kind of sucks because by the time I finish the noodles, the broth is too salty for me to drink.  Can't wait to go back!"

We were actually surprised that we were able to be seated right away as a party of 5. When we left there was a line going outside the door, so I'd either come early or expect a wait because this place is super tiny inside (there's a few tables and then bar style seating). \n\nLooking over the menu, I was shocked at how cheap the ramen was. But then I realized that the ramen is very basic -- broth, 2 slices of pork, green onions, ramen and bamboo shoots. If you want extras like egg, extra pork, corn, kimchi, etc. you'll have to pay extra. But even after adding toppings my food still came out to be like $10. \n\nWe started off sharing a pork belly bowl as a table. It was pretty good! As for my meal, I ordered the Miso ramen and asked for spicy paste on the side. I also opted to add the egg and corn.  After adding the spicy paste in my Miso ramen it tasted great and was full of flavor! The miso ramen also had the thick wavy noodles that I love. \n\nService was quick and efficient. I kind of got the vibe that they wanted us to leave quickly after paying the bill, but I can't really blame them with a line out of the door! If you're looking for an inexpensive meal that will fill you up then you should check out Monta Ramen!"

For good reason, as there nothing bad to say about this place.  \n\nRamen is extremely reasonably priced around $7 or $8, portions are not enormous but filling.  Low use of msg, as I'm not thirsty at all after the meal.  Noodles are cooked perfectly.\n\nThe star is the black sesame ramen, very rich flavor, one of the best ones I've tasted.\n\nThis small restaurant can be easily missed on Spring Mountain Road.  Best thing to do is use the GPS for first timers.\n\nHighly recommended!"

No pressure but I did get nervous trying to find parking in the strip mall.\nI guess the wait is long because the place is tiny!

We waited for the only table capable of seating 7 and watched in agony as the current seated party socialized, giggled, and took selfies. Ugh...hurry up guys.\nThe prices are incredibly competitive and the servings are huge. There isn't much selection on the menu but you really shouldn't be coming here to expect anything other than ramen. The one person who did not want ramen in our group had fried rice and said it was pretty good. The ramen itself is decent. It might be a personal preference but I had to tweak mine a bit with condiments to get the broth to my liking. I don't usually have to do this when I go for ramen. The broth was also slightly a bit thicker than I prefer. \nThe service was quick and efficient, bathrooms available and clean. I will be back and recommend you give it a try too."

Lets start with atmosphere, located in china town in a small shopping mall and if your dropped off by a cab good luck trying to get another one unless you call (TIP) The place is small and well its packed all the time i go at least so get here early or try an off night. The inside is exactly how it is in japan SMALL and casual so taking a date here on your first date wouldnt be ideal but you can try raku next door. Now to the good part FOOD, i love the noodles here cooked perfectly not chewy and over cooked like a lot of ramen places (note: ramen is all about the noodles so i give the noodles alone 4 stars) down to the broth which was well a little too salty not a bad broth but def overpowered the noodles and chasu so i had to deduct points. Service here is well my experience was great, server sat us fast and got our order perfect, and key point kept my WATER full which is my biggest thing at any  restaurant; why you ask because its the easiest thing to do and well most places fuck up and thats how i determine tip as well (TIP) Overall this is the ramen spot to go to in vegas so far until something else pops up but however this is still not the best well at least in vegas it is thank you Monta i will return!"

No nonsense of having a hard time trying to figure out what you want to eat. The soup is hearty and filling, the chashu topping is so amazing, nicely sliced. I always get egg with my ramen and a cold beer.

For the locals who think that this place is just aiteeeee, I'm jealous of y'all! The black garlic tonkotsu is just dripping with richness and FLAVOR - one of the best bowls I've ever had. The spicy tonkotsu, while also great, is my second favorite - flavor wise, it is comparable to Ippudo's akamaru modern. My first bite into the perfectly firm al dente noodles put me on cloud nine. It's the little things in life, you know? \n\nWhen you factor in the price of this place, the value is almost no comparison to most ramen joints in the US. Monta's prices are almost similar to ramen shops in Japan, that is to say that it is EXTREMELY affordable. It's a hole in the wall with fast, efficient service - the best kind of ramen joint if you ask me.

Think rich and thick tonkotsu broth with an added black garlic oil that is immaculately fragrant and savory. You know it's been simmering for hours the moment that soup touches your lips and coats your mouth like silk. I tell you, it's delicious beyond words. Give in to the urge of adding that flavored egg for an extra $1.50 and some corn for $.50 more. The option to add butter is there if you think this bowl could use more fat than it already contains. Go ahead, I won't judge. The noodles are chewy with a good bounce to it however, the next time I'm here, I'm asking if they can substitute the thin noodles to the thick wavy ones they use for the miso ramen. It's just something I prefer and definitely not a deal breaker.\n\nI've heard good things about the PORK BELLY BOWL (sm $3.95) and I concur. It's slices of tender pork with a sweet and salty marinade over white rice, and then topped with ginger and green onions. Only, after having the KIMCHI FRIED RICE ($6.95), there was no looking back at that pork bowl. The latter won my heart and palate as soon as a heaping spoonful made it to my mouth. Oh how I wanted to come back that same weekend for more. \n\nWhat's impressive too is the efficiency of the servers and kitchen.

It was as if the ramen gods heard my cravings and made it rain (it's summer) to set the mood. It also cut the line short as people started leaving due to the heavy rain and well... long wait. We, obviously took advantage. T'was meant to be. I ordered miso ramen and added extra chashu pork, flavored egg & shredded green onions for that extra crisp. Mister ordered tonkotsu shoyu ramen with flavored egg. Thank goodness he did because I was very much torn and even thought about getting both for myself. Mine was hands down better than his. I'm sure he thought the same because he had my bowl for a good 10 minutes. On top of all that goodness, we ordered a pork belly bowl & we each had 2 glasses of Asahi beer. Best meal ever!\n\nThe only thing is, this place is quite small."

The whole small hole in the wall love because look where the restaurant located understand.\n\nThe food all the ramen is good. Shoyu Ramen I die for!! The flavor is spot on the depth nice light broth and depending if order additional topping can be hearty noodle dish. I prefer couple extras. Other thing find must really perfect compliment too big bowl of ramen is gyoza. It steamed perfectly then seared off on flat top too perfection and the filling is tasty. The gyoza sauce optional but must only way too have it combine together is divine. \n\nThey other sides I order the kim chee good but stand out is kim chee fried rice. It could ordered big bowl of that if they had it on the menu. =( It not over spicy but just the right amount of balance. They even have one beer offer on tap never think see small the place is never been good one too. I not remember name of it. Sorry.\n\nThe service is excellent.

The noodles are good, but it's the broth that made it. It is not exactly the most healthy as you're pretty much drinking some of that pork fat, but it totally gives the ramen that extra kick. I've been lucky to have come here each time to have to wait only 2-5 minutes, and only to have been seated to be thankful I escape the crowd of line suddenly waiting. The place is very small, not good for a big group, and seating is very limited. Try to eat and go so other hungry ramen eaters can enjoy!"

Got here about 8pm, luckily my cousin snagged a table since the place filled up fast. The menu here is pretty simple, ramen, sides, rice dishes and thats about it. I had the Tonkatsu with the premium green onions and the four of us split orders of Gyoza, Kim Che fried rice, large order of Pork Belly over rice and the Fish Eggs over rice (the name escapes me). Everything was very delicious. About the best I've had in a while including places on Sawtelle Blvd in West LA, known for its large Japanese population. \n\nPros: Ramen was a nice al-dente with good chew, broth was very savory it definitely had that umami kick to it.

And next time, I'll try the extra toppings..but it says a lot about the flavor of the soup when I loved it plain the way it came.\n\nSo why the 4 stars?  We also ordered kimchi fried rice and the dumplings.  The dumplings were ok, nothing special about it.  It came slightly burnt and were all stuck together.

I've definitely had better egg in my time so next time I'd try some other add on.\n\nwhile the food was good, the service was what stuck in our minds that first night. nicest wait staff ever! we also vowed to take my noodle loving 10 year old nephew and my sister when they rolled into town the next day.  \n\nso today we went around lunch time, and longer line so again we hit the snowflake shavery first! while waiting, we saw the flyer that they opened a monta in henderson! we'll definitely try that next. This time the wait was longer and we worked up our post-snow appetites...and score! the nephew and sister loved it! also i tried the takana fried rice this time which I thought was great. Just the right amount of spiciness and with the mustard green, unique from chinese fried rice. my better half had the shoyu ramen this time, which was indeed lighter than the tonkotsu broth. I think I preferred the tonkotsu but it was good to have tried them both.\n\nnext stop will definitely be the one near my parents house on eastern. thanks yelp for the recommendation!"

Either find a job you like or crack a smile and be more welcoming! \n\nBut service is quick like any ramen place should be, and the broth to noodle ratio was perfect! I loved how their noodles were not in a giant ball and it was cooked the right way. You go to crappy places, you get noodles that are over cooked like  olive garden or almost stiff noodles as if ramen is meant to be al dente pasta. Monta's broth was pretty darn good too! I only wish they didn't charge ridiculous amounts for the extra topping....what could be a mind blowing cheap mean turns into a meal where I spent just as much on the toppings as the bowl of ramen itself."

Luckily, service and cook time are quick, so I have never had to wait more than fifteen minutes or so for a table or spot even when it's crowded.  \n\nMonta is a small, hole in the wall ramen place.  There are three kinds of seating: booth, table and bar stools.  If you're eating solo or you have a small party, you'll probably get seated more quickly because the individual bar stools will open up.  Additionally, so they can keep the flow going and keep wait times down, you'll have to sign in on a sheet, and they won't seat you until your entire party is present.  From the bar, you can see the crew in the kitchen cooking the meals.\n\nOn to the food.  I normally order the Tonkot-Shoyu (mixed broth of the Tonkotsu and Shoyu) with corn and nori (dried seaweed), and add in some chili oil and spices from the table set.  The soup itself comes with chashu pork, bamboo shoots, kikarage (black mushrooms) and green onion.  I've tried ramen at two other locations (one in the Galleria mall in Henderson, and the other was Anime Ramen) and this is definitely my favorite spot to go.  The noodles have just the right amount of chewiness, the broth is flavorful but not overpowering, and the chashu is tender, melt in your mouth goodness.  \n\nI have also tried the pork belly bowl and gyoza, and both are pretty good.  I wish they had a different sauce for the gyoza, but soy sauce mixed with vinegar and a little chili oil works just fine.  I've only discovered this place in the last year, but I can honestly say it's become one of my go-to restaurants and it's definitely a comfort food.  Prices are more expensive than your fifty cent package of Top Ramen, but it's still cheap for a restaurant at under ten dollars an entree.  \n\nMy only bone to pick is that their green tea is only chilled and it comes in a can, though as far as canned green tea goes, it's not bad."

I think the bowl of ramen I had was around $7, versus the $9 I spend at other joints.  But do not be deceived by the price, the noodles are good, and so is the broth.  \n\nAfter reading all the reviews we got here before it opened.  Since there was already a couple sitting on the bench, I decided to stand by the pillar near the door.  Within 10 minutes, a crowd began to form and they created their own impromptu line...which I was late to realize.  Still, I decided it would be ridiculous for me to get to the back of the line, which was beyond the front of the restaurant at that point, and so I stuck it out, and just got in line once the doors opened behind the first couple figuring those who came later had to have seen me standing there.  Luckily all went smoothly without any incident.\n\nFood came out quickly, and service was good.  For big eaters, the offer extra noodles for a little more than a buck.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals.    \n\nWith that said, my tip to you is that if you get there before the door opens, beware of the line that quickly forms, as I noticed that I would not have been able to get a seat, had I decided to conform to what everyone else decided to do.  Still I can't fault them for creating a line, as there were truly a lot of people that got there seemingly at the same time, and still more getting there as the restaurant finally opened."

The noodles and pork were fantastic.  The broth was also incredibly flavorful with a smoother, milder taste.  I tried the tonkatsu broth too which is equally wonderful but in a more milky, slightly heavier way.  The gyoza was also great especially paired with some of the sauces. \nThis was definitely one of the best things I have eaten in a long time.  The fact that I was hungover and had spent the morning in the desert only added to the greatness.\n\nThe place had a very nice, and subtle ambiance.  The place was clean, the decorations were very simple but had personality and the place drew a nice crowd that was more than just the tourists that clog the Strip.  The wait staff was also incredibly helpful, efficient, and friendly.  I liked that when my table ordered the gyoza they said it would be ready in seven minutes.  Now that's service!  Oh, and they have A/C now. so your desert heat fears can be alleviated.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip and also want some great Ramen this is the place to go.  I definitely recommend going.  Also, great hangover food."

The place is pretty small and seats about about 30 people, but from what I've heard from people that have been to Japan the look and feel of the place would be your typical ramen house. The first time I visited Monta was with a group of 6 and the wait wasn't that bad considering it was during lunch and the place was pretty packed. I also liked the fact that you can sit at the counter in front of the cooks so you can see all the action going on in the kitchen.\n\nThe food here is awesome, from the ramen to the gyoza to the pork belly bowl all are simple dishes with outstanding flavor. I've tried both the Shoyu and the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen the only difference was the broth where the tonkotsu was a pork bone flavored broth. In both they put slices of pork which have been slowly braised to the point it melts in your mouth. So if you're a pork lover this is the place to come check out. The noodles are cooked to perfection and by watching the cooks they use a fresh noodles in which they cook to order. The texture combination of the soft pork and the chewy noodles makes you want more and more.\n\nI guarantee you will never pick up the package ramen ever again after you've visited Monta. So if your looking for a quick bite and want quality Japanese ramen come check out Monta it will make you say \"cup 'o' what???\""

Ingredients on the ramen are placed on top, but before I mixed everything altogether I tried the broth and it was very good.   Adding the ingredients of the spicy sauce, Mustard Leaf and Chasu in Pork broth made the soup just way too salty for me to eat it.  I really wish the server would had informed me that this would have happened.  Otherwise, the Chasu was really tender and the thin noodles were not too overwhelming.  Everything in the bowl was well portioned. Then I had the gyoza, it just tasted like any frozen gyoza purchased at a super market.  Overall, I would come back here and not make the same mistake by ordering too many salty add ons in my ramen."

My kindergarten aged daughter's new favorite eatery. :)\n\nI've been coming here with my family on and off now since opening, and even though the broths and noodles are still very tasty, the quality of the soups and other items have been hit/miss over the last year or so.  Used to be that we'd always order the takana rice and gyoza, but both of those taste like microwaved foods now (even though freshly made - if you watch the kitchen).\n\nThe broths are still very tasty, but sometimes overly salty, sometimes not enough.  Hit/miss, like I said.  Stay away from the shoyu and miso version if you don't need extra sodium.  Normally I just get the tonkotsu with corn, nitamago, and takana on the side (self-add for saltiness).  If I'm there with my daughter, then I get an extra order of noodles to share - broth is usually enough for two decent sized bowls.  \n\nSeating at the counter is still the most fun - especially with young(er) kids.  But being that the restaurant is tiny (only has five 4-tops I believe and 9 or 10 counter seats), groups larger than 2 usually wait a while.  \n\nStill a great ramen place to sit down and slurp in some noodles on cool Vegas nights though!  Just stick to the basics!"

For one, I didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and I had a hard time finding it. It is inside of a plaza where I had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.\n\nMy friends that have tried Monta beforehand liked it enough where I had some expectations for this place. It didn't have to be rated G-A-F, but it had to be tasty. The first time I came, I just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and I must say, I was one happy guy afterwards. The noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. The broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. Needless to say, I finished the whole bowl, soup and all! I was really happy. \n\nThe next few times I came, I started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. I added more noodles the next few times, got some of their fried rice, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where I was happy! Their fried rice was pretty tasty. The kimchi fried rice may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. Adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better. \n\nIf you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, I highly recommend Monta. The only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. People get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits? It is small, but people keep going back because the food is delicious, it's as simple as that."

I told my PFGT, \"This is Ramen!\" Her Miso Ramen was just as good.  Needless to say, down to the last slurp of the broth, I would definitely go back!  Prices are fantastic!"

The shop isn't particularly big and I guess people heard about the hype so there can be a 20-40 minute wait a lot of the time. \n\nI got the tonkatsu ramen and the base price is such a great deal at just $6.75. I added corn for $1 extra and my friend and I also shared the fried rice. You also have to purchase green tea and it comes hot in a can (so interesting). Still, after all that, our total was $32 after tax which is such a great deal! \n\nIf there's a long wait, there's a boba place next door thats really good so you can kill time there. Since we only waited about 20 minutes, we left the boba for after dinner :)"

Last week we tried another Ramen house down the street from Monta and it was nowhere near as good. We've had ramen in Japan, Hawaii and California and Monta is the closest to what you can find on the streets of Tokyo. \n\nWe started out with Kimchee and the fried rice. They were both amazing! The Kimchee had an amazing taste and the fried rice was probably the best I have had! I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen, my wife had the miso ramen and my kids shared the cold noodles. All had amazing flavor with robust noodles and tender meat. The dishes were bursting with flavor! My kids pounded the cold noodles and the fried rice.\n\nOverall, Monta is a MUST TRY when in Las Vegas. This is going to be a regular spot for us. Oh, the place is really small... So don't expect to have a big party and get in right away. You'll wait 20-30 minutes before you get in. Enjoy!"

I found it while browsing reviews on Yelp, and Yelp was right on target!  \n\nThe place is quite small, seating maybe 30 people, including the bar.  During lunch, there is a wait to get seated.  The cooks are out in the open, similar to the sushi bar trend.  I've always had good service, although sometimes there is a little bit of a communication problem... my English isn't so good sometimes! ;-)  But that's never annoyed me because I love the soups here.\n\nSo far I have only tried the Tonkatsu. I ordered with extra pork, egg, and (I know, shame on me), butter.  you can also order extra noodles if you aren't a big broth eater.  The Tonkatsu is, I believe, a pork based broth.  Its thick (for a broth), a little salty (but not too salty), and very flavorful.  The pork was cut very thinly, and was so juicy, almost buttery.  I barely had to chew it.  Now, I am no expert in homemade noodles or anything, but the noodles for me were quite good... filling and tasty.  \n\nI can't wait to try the other two main ramen dishes they have.  I know now isn't the perfect time for hot ramen, but I'll make an exception to that rule for this place any time!"

Tucked away in the back of a somewhat crowded strip mall (on your right hand side as you pass Decatur going up Spring Mountain) is Monta Ramen.  As with most Japanese Ramen houses, this place is tiny but I think that's what makes it feel so authentic. \n\nWhat sets Monta apart from the others I've tried is the deliciously rich pork bone soup base that you know has been simmering for hours on end.  The noodles are perfect, not too firm but not soggy and the portions are just right.  And if you're crazy enough in thinking about adding that ridiculously priced $1.50 egg, do it.  Even though it costs the same as almost a dozen at the supermarket you won't regret it because it's semi runny/creamy texture blends perfectly with the soup.  Sitting at the bar, digging into my bowl of noodle heaven made me feel like I needed to start loudly slurping to show my appreciation. \n\nIf you're in the area Monta is definitely not to be missed...or actually don't go, it'll be a shorter wait for me.  :)"

You can order a few different kinds of ramen and a few sides if you so wish, as the menu is very small and focused on the main attraction. Still, the Gyoza are exceptional and I also enjoy the pork belly bowl. Forst and foremost however is the ramen, and of those choices I believe the tonkotsu shoyu ramen and miso ramen are the best options. Tonkotsu shoyu is a perfect blend of broths and flavor with thin noodles while the miso is even more complex and comes with slightly thicker, chewier noodles. If you are not full by the end, don't discard your broth and resist drinking it all up. Just ask for more noodles and you can keep the joy going."

If they can make tonkatsu, the shoyu and miso are bound to be good.  Such is the case with Monta.  The tonkatsu is creamy and savory, with just the right amount of salt.

Check.\nHard benches?\nCheck.\nTiny waiting space?\nCheck.\nCompletely open mail slot in the middle of December with a door that didn't close so it was incredibly drafty and wet and miserable?  \nCheck.\n\nAt some point I was actually convinced that this was their plot: Make you so hungry and cold and put-out that you would just find the food euphoric when you finally arrived.\n\nNot to mention that they were OUT of miso so anything that had miso in it was not an option.  Seriously, my favorite thing on the menu?  You're out of it??\n\nSo finally managed to get to our food and the taste was great.  Broth was wonderful, noodles perfectly cooked.

After dining at Monta and though the price is right, my conclusion is either Vegas lacks great ramen spots or Vegas Yelpers have low expectations for ramen...or maybe even both...\n\nWAIT:\nOur party of seven arrived a bit after 1pm on a Friday afternoon.  Monta isn't a big place.  They accommodate approximately about 10 people at the bar and another 20-25 seated.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table which in the end, our party of seven had to split into two separate groups to be seated.\n\nFOOD:\n*Tonkatsu Ramen ($6.95) - Though the broth was tasty and hearty, the noodles totally failed.  The noodles were different from what I am use to and I wasn't a fan of the thin, vermicelli like noodles which made the broth taste starchy the longer they sat there.  Toppings on the noodles were two pieces of chasui, bamboo shoots, green onions, and kikurage mushrooms.  One of our friends ordered the miso ramen and it came with noodles we were more accustomed to.\n\n*Pork Belly Bowl ($3.95 small/$5.75 large) - Delicious!  We ordered a large bowl and shared it with the table.  A generous amount of tasty pork belly is shredded over rice and topped with chopped green onions.\n\nSERVICE:\nTypical Asian restaurant as you basically order, get your food, and get the bill.  Food took about 15 minutes or so to come out.\n\nPARKING:\nPrivate lot"

Monta is my favorite Ramen house in town, and is the best that I have tried.  The broth is deep, full-bodied, creamy, and very meaty.  This broth is what is missing from many Ramen places.  The noodles have very nice texture, which is what I mainly look for in the noodles.  \n\nI usually get the Tonkastu Ramen with a little extra Roasted Pork, but I like the Miso Ramen, too.  The Miso is also very good, but just different.  I would characterize the Miso as sweeter, and I usually prefer the meatier broth to the sweet broth, but that's just me.  I also love that all the Ramen's are below $7, I believe.  I think I usually pay around 6.95 for the Ramen, so it's a great deal.  \nI have also tried the Pork Belly Bowl, which I really like.  I always try to order pork belly wherever I see it, and Monta's did not disappoint.  \nI also like to get their canned, chilled Oolong Tea.  I think they have a couple other types, but I usually just get the Oolong.  \n\nIf you like Ramen, you should definitely check out Monta.  But if you don't like soup, noodles, or any combination of these, I wouldn't come because most of their menu is Ramen."

Monta Ramen was the first thing that popped up in our search, so we headed there.\n\nAs we arrived, there was a small line formed outside the building. Typical for a well known ramen spot. We added our name to the wait list and had about a fifteen minute wait. Once we were called, we sat around the prep area. Our server handed us our menus and gave my cousin some recommendations on their popular dishes. As for myself, I already knew what I was going to get.\n\nI decided to the the miso based ramen, which includes some basic ingredients:\n\n- Green onions \n- Two slices of chashu\n- Bamboo shoots\n- Kikurage\n\nThere are extras you can add to your ramen, pricing varies. I got the following extras:  \n\n- Butter\n- Corn\n- Extra side of noodles\n- Nori\n- Soft boiled egg\n\nOur ramens came out fairly quickly after placing our orders. As quickly as they were served, they remained piping hot! The presentation was nicely put together. I mixed all the ingredients in the bowl and took my first sip of the broth. The broth was very tasty. The addition of the butter gave the broth a creamy taste. The noodles were soft and easy to chew. The hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked to my liking with the runny yolk. The chashu seemed a little dry, but still tasted great.\n\nOverall, a great experience and comparable to some of my favorite ramen spots in the Bay Area."

They focus on ramen with two types of broth and other rice bowl dishes. Unlike their wait, the service is quick and efficient. We ordered the shoyu ramen with corn, large pork belly rice bowl and chashu bowl. The Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen had a deep and thick broth.\nThe pork belly rice bowl was delicious! The thin and tender pieces of pork were cooked to perfection and the fatty components melted in your mouth. The juices from the pork travel down to the rice and leaving enough flavor for you to even eat the rice alone.\nThe Mentaiko bowl was a great contrast to the ramen.

The noodles come out quickly and it is fun to watch your order being made.  I got the Soy Ramen with extra scallions and extra pork.  Get the extra pork.  Each bowl comes with like 2 thin slices of pork.  It was my favorite part of the bowl, it is braised fatty pork that kind of melts in your soup and your mouth.  The flavor is wonderful and noodles are tender and slurpable (is that  a word?).  \n\nIt was 20 bucks without tip and included two beers and two bowls.  It was quick and fun and tasty.  In the past I have had ramen bowls that were tasty, but they usually come with fish cakes and a few other things I don't love.  But this was pretty straight forward and no fish in any of these.

For entertainment purposes though, my group started out with an order of their gyoza, which was made from scratch, and was very tasty. The texture was a bit crispy-like on the outside, and that's all that it took (I think) to make it that much tastier. The inside had that \"it's hot, but just right\" feel to make it warm up the insides.\n\nThough really now, it's all about the ramen. Monta prepares ramen in a Japanese fashion, the importance on the soup base. I had the tonkatsu (pork) base with extras of corn, egg, nori (seaweed for those who don't know), and some extra tonkatsu. The broth was a little bit saltier than I would have liked it, but all in all it was a very good blend of flavors that would make anybody want to come back for more. (b^^)b\n\nIn terms of drinks, you want to avoid pretty much everything on the menu besides water. It's a ramen shop, so you really want to focus more on the awesomeness of ramen, but I'm a bit sad that there isn't hot tea; my group ordered tea thinking it was hot, but it comes in a can that's been sitting in a fridge. Not a big letdown, but on a cold day in Las Vegas (those do exist) it would be nice to have a cup of hot tea to go with the ramen.\n\nAtmosphere wise, everything resembles your typical Japanese ramen shop. The music adds a nice touch, but really it's the small, cramped family-like atmosphere that gives it that ramen shop touch. It's definitely good for those who want to catch up with one another or a small group of people looking for somewhere to eat; that's the atmosphere that was created.\n\nAll in all, a very good experience and if you want to eat some good legitimate Japanese style ramen, Monta is the place you want to go.

You must also pay for additional toppings such as butter, nori, etc. I either get a side of kimchi or the small pork belly bowl which is equally delicious and abundantly layered in a rice bowl.\n\nI applaud the waitresses for their patience and kindness. The place is almost always beyond busy and full, yet they still handle and attend to customers quickly and with a good attitude. \n\nI always recommend to friends, but this is a fairly fairly small venue for such popularity (they have also recently opened another one in Henderson) so either have a treat for adventurous self, or go with a few friends, but not very accommodating for very large parties."

You'll be hungry forever! \n\nBaseline offerings are affordable, but in a way its like an American airline- you get nickeled and dimed for every additional item, including an egg. By the time you've built the bowl of your dreams, you're probably pushing a few bucks extra than what you thought you'd be! \n\nThe meat here is melt-in-your-mouth and fall apart tender. Really good. The egg is quite tasty as well.  I can tell that the food here is cooked meticulously and with pride when watching the guys cooking your noodles. That being said, I don't think it was really that exciting or remarkable. I got the shoyu ramen with less sodium in it, and the noodles and flavor weren't as good as Ramen Sora's.\n\nIf you had to pick one of the two to try, I would try Ramen Sora. The atmosphere at Monta reminds me more of a cold winter day in Japan in a packed ramen house, but I like my American elbow room! Also, the flavors are brighter and portions are bigger at Ramen Sora. ;)"

The tonkotsu LITERALLY melted in my mouth and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The broth was so stinkin' rich that I surrendered after eating only half of the bowl - the girls that I went with did the same. We were all in disbelief at how good it was - really, not being dramatic, though the fact that some of us were mildly hungover might have something to do with it...\n\nAnyway, the ONLY downside is that the place is not suitable for groups larger than 4-5, but the waitresses were still accommodating when I went with a group of 10. Monta will definitely be on my list for my next Vegas trip if I'm not up for a Vegas buffet or I'm not feeling bad enough for some pho down the street."

The broth for both were extremely creamy and delicious. If you like things with a bit more flavor, I suggest the tonkotsu-shoyu. The ramen noodles are the thin, angel-hair type which is a nice change from the usual ones we get in SF. \n\nThe egg..how could I forget to order the soft-boiled egg? I'm actually still bitter about that. So please do me (and yourself) a favor and add a soft-boiled egg to your ramen. \n\nWe also smelled the fried rice aroma from our neighbor and couldn't help but get a small order to share ourselves.

So during the colder months, we make our way as much as possible to Monta for Ramen\n\nIt's tiny noodle shop, the counter seats ten and five table tops that seats twelve total.  It's open until late at night and it cranks out people like no one's business-prety much there's always a waiting list to get into this place!\n\nAnd it is well worth it,  the Ramen is some of the best that we have had, (and that includes Japan!  Gasp! Horror! Blasphemy!) but it's true-we went to Hide Chan Ramen in Fukuoka and the broth wasn't as good as Monta's!\n\nAs we always do, there's a couple of things that we order and not much else, (it's hard to venture out when you know a dish is that good).  We start the Japanese journey with an order of the Gyoza; these pork dumplings are perfectly cooked, a crunchy charred exterior that holds in the moist juices of the pork.  Add Sujoyu, (a mixture of Vinegar and Soy Sauce) Rayu (Chili Oil) and some raw garlic, dip these little moon shaped suckers in it and pop' em in your pie hole! \n\nAfter you've wet your appetite, it's time move onto the Main Event; the Ramen.  As is, we're partial to the Tonkotsu (Pork Bone) Ramen- the broth is made from simmered Pork Bone, Fat and Collagen which gives it its super rich, almost creamy soup that can easily fill you up and warm your body.  It's most definitely the most satisfying noodle soup on this planet.  And especially since this is a Kyushu dish, (Fukuoka is on the  island of Kyushu) I'm particular to the flavor.  (Japan based on its regions have different tastes and styles to the same dish).  \n\nMonta's Tonkotsu Ramen recipe is from Kurume, (not far from Fukuoka) so it's really close to my heart.  Which is why you won't see me ordering the other Ramen, (there's Shoyu, Miso and Tonkotsu-Shoyu).  One of these days, We'll get to them......\n\nThere's a couple of add ons and I would definitely go and order an extra Chashu, (Roasted Pork) these tender slices of heaven are as much as a main character as the Noodles and Broth.  Getting to the Noodles, have you ever had anything better than Ramen Noodles? They're just so unique; chewy and Monta really cooks them right.  We also get the Nitamago, (cooked egg) Takana, (Mustard Leaf) and sometimes Nori, (Seaweed) -the egg for extra protein, the Takana for the vegetable and crunch and Nori for the contrast in texture.  You can also order an extra helping of Ramen Noodles (Kaedama) if you have extra broth, but there's no way I have ever had enough room for that!!!\n\nIn the Summertime, they serve Hiyashi-Chuka (Cold Chinese Noodles). It's refreshing and cold perfect for the summer with bits of Ham, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Takana, Nori and Sesame Seeds over Ramen noodles in a light Soy; it's the best on a hot day!!!\n\nI forgot to mention the Rice bowls that they serve as well; I'm not the biggest fan of these bowls but that just me- a lot of people rave about them!  I know what I like and I'm happy staying on my side of the menu if you know what I mean...The service here is excellent, the waitresses are terribly polite and the the food comes outs really fast! (They need too, cuz they have to get people in and out of there)!\n\n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\n\nFood          4.75\nAmbience  4\nService      4.5"

I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu with nori and egg and the flavor combos were ah-mazing! We also got an order of the gyoza which were pretty tasty as well.

My favorite is the shoyu, but I find myself ordering the miso every now and again.  Whichever broth you choose, I would definitely get an egg added.  Their spiced eggs are simply delicious.  I have not had any of their other menu items so I cannot comment on those.  \n\nThe best thing about this place, other than the food, is the atmosphere.  The waitstaff  is friendly and quick and even all of the customers are in good spirits (it is hard not to be with ramen like theirs).\n\nAll in all, this is a fun place for any occasion.  Off work and don't want to cook? Monta Ramen.  Date night? Monta Ramen.  Just plain hungry? Monta Ramen."

The quality of their noodles are really good. The noodles are not over or under cooked. The tonkotsu is my favorite! The menu is very simple with not a lot of options. But, everything on the menu is great! \n\nThe service here is also very good. The food comes to you very quickly. The establishment is relatively small so if it gets busy it could take a while for seating. If you have been to Japan, it has a typical hole in the wall ramen place to it. I like this place a lot more because it feels exactly like you are in Japan. Even the workers speak Japanese. But other than that, Monta Noodle House is one of the best tonkotsu ramen I have had. I have been going there for some time now and will definitely continue going there."

Definitely a busy place at around 7ish on a weekday night. Lucked out for a table as there are only 5/6 depending how they're arranged for size. Wood benches, chairs, stools, tables and wainscoting lined the restaurant.   There's also L shaped seating for around 10, bar style, around the kitchen area.  The restaurant later filled up with people waiting outside, so be prepared to wait during the typical eat times.\n\nMenu was simple as there was only 3 types of ramen you could order, Miso, Shoyu, Tonkotsu and a couple of rice dishes.  Decided to try the shoyu ramen ($6.95) with toppings (ranges from $0.50 - $1.50) corn, kimchi, and Kaedama (extra noodles).  The broth was tasty and not too salty and the pork was flavourful with the melt in your mouth taste.  The corn was not too buttery but the kimchi could of been better. I was expecting more taste from the kimchi, as it was toned down from other Ramen places I've tried in the past as well as Korean restaurants. The extra noodles was served on the side and was fist sized.  Do this if you're extra hungry...I was comatose after finishing this.  The noodle was a little skinnier than expected but had the right consistency and texture. The gyoza was not too my liking (didnt finish) and I can live off dumplings! The exterior was grilled too long aka burnt and the 'insides' was semi cold like another yelper had mentioned....hmmmm...im guessing store bought?  I imagine them being frozen and put on the grill not long enough but on extra high heat!!! (I know this how??? I make them when I'm home...lol)\n\nYes, I'd come here again for a quick bowl of noodles but thats about it."

I was soooooo relieved that Monta did not disappoint as I was also feeling a bit guilty for making my friend wait so long with me.\n\nTheir ramens are surprisingly good and the broth is flavorful, but not overly heavy. I ordered the tonkatsu broth with chashu and egg. The chashu was fork tender and I really appreciated that the yolk was not fully cooked. We also LOVED their Mentaiko bowl. The scallion, nori and touch of soy with the mentaiko was a match made in heaven. We went back on our last night in Vegas just to have it for the last time. \n\nMaking the trek to CT for Monta is so worthed it. The bill plus tip and RT taxi fare will be cheaper than any comparable restaurant you find on the strip."

Sadly someone took my spot but whatever lol \n\nI usually order tonkatsu shoyu with chashu,nitamago & corn..\nThe broth is just sooooooo gooood! I've been to so many ramen places here in Vegas and none of them can compare to this! \nThe broth is like creamy pork flavor with shoyu (soy sauce), the chashu pork is very tender and thin which is perfect for me it's so so so good! The noodles are firm and not too soggy which I love as well ^__^ \nFor side dishes I usually get takana fried rice and gyoza :) so yummy \n\nAs for the people that work there, they already know that I'm a regular so they usually give us good seats and we also tip them really good lol\nJust don't go there during the weekends or around 7pm so many people waiting in line. I just wish they would renovate & make the place bigger since its very famous already and u get to sit more customers ya know?! \nI can't wait to go back this week & eat there again.

It is located in the same strip mall as another popular Japanese place, Raku.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION and ORDERING\nAs we stood waiting for about maybe 15-20 min, we peeked over to the table of 4 who were eating on a table smack right next to the entry door where everyone was standing & waiting. We saw that the fried rice looked a tad greasy and so did the ramen broth. My dinner companion gave me that look of \"hmmm\" and I said \"I guess we'll just try it since we're already here\". We were curious to compare this to our usual Ramen Dojo (San Mateo, CA).\n\nWe ordered one tonkotsu $6.95 (+egg $1.50  and corn $0.50), one shoyu ramen $6.95 with extra chasu (+4 pieces, $2.50) and one kimchi fried rice $6.95 (hoping this would be less greasy than the regular fried rice and it was slightly less common in the Ramen place).  Having not eaten lunch that day, we were huuungry and ready to devour our order as soon as it arrived. First impression: noodles presentation looked neat and mouthwatering; the ingredients were neatly arranged on top and the bowl of ramen looked quite appetizing. Especially with 2 hungry stomachs impatiently waiting to devour them. LOL. \n\nThe broth didn't appear as greasy as my earlier glance at the previous table.  There was a curious black ring around each of the chasu (more about this later) that's usually not present in the other ramen's place chasu piece.  Interesting, we thought.\n\nThe fried rice still looked a tad on the greasy side by the shines it showed. But in all fairness, I haven't ordered Japanese fried rice in a ramen place for some time. Maybe they all look like that.\n\nNow on to the fun part.\n\nFOOD\nThe broth on the tonkotsu ramen was delish. Slightly on the lighter side compared to Ramen Dojo, but it was still good. One big difference that made Ramen Dojo's broth more 'hearty' and tasty was the addition of chicken bits in their broths. If you like a lighter version of Tonkotsu broth, you will like Monta's version better.\n\nThe shoyu broth was light yet had a lot of flavor. \n\nThe tonkotsu bowl came with thin noodles. We both were very curious how good (smooth) this thin noodle would be. While not as 'smooth' as some of the other thin ramen noodles we've tried in Japan, we were pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty it was. So, thumbs up here.\n\nThe noodles in the shoyu bowl was also pretty good. It is the yellow, thicker, curly kind; of course heavier than the one in the tonkotsu bowl, yet not super-heavy.\n\nAs for the curious black ring around the chasu, as you probably have guessed, it is the pork skin. The skin itself was a real thin strip with a very thin layer of fat underneath it.  Including this skin gave the soup broth an extra flavor and aroma that distinguished it from other ramen's place broth. It was probably also why the half-finished ramen bowl we peeked earlier looked slightly greasier. I don't typically see this pork skin included in other ramen shop. This is a plus for the broth. The slightly greasier broth didn't quite happen as much in my bowl. 'cause I like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. LOL. Another thumbs up!\n\nThe last dish which was the kimchee fried rice ($6.95) was yum, though I still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  Unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this fried rice came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.\n\nSERVICE\nService was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. But we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.\n\nTwo thumbs up for this place.\n\nANECDOTAL COMMENTS & OBSERVATIONS (mostly rhetorical)\nWhy is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? No outside food. No outside drink. No tacos? (seriously, this place has a picture of tacos with a cross on it and Japanese writing)."

My experience with Japanese food is that presentation is more important than flavor. That wasn't the case here. \nWe started with gyoza. These dumplings were tasty although maybe a tad too salty for me. Then our ramen soon arrived. I got the kontatsu with pork belly, green onions, egg and corn. The broth was tasty. A couple of different flavors going on. Quite savory. The noodles were perfect. Not overcooked and delicious. And all the toppings were good, too. \nJanet got miso soup and was quite happy with her choice. She noted it was thicker than my soup.\nIt seems like a winner.\nWhen we got there at 7 p.m. there were a couple of open tables and most of the bar was empty.

The place was tucked away in a little mini mall. Plenty of parking in the lot, but it can be a tight fit.\n\nAt this time, the place was still relatively full. We were able to get the last open table. The menu is short and to the point. You can choose from four types of ramen broths, add your toppings, or even add extra noodles. As for other menu items, there was some fried rice options and handmade gyozas. We ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen with charsui, egg, and nori; the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen (a bit less rich than the regular tonkatsu ramen) with same toppings; pork belly rice bowl; kimchee fried rice and an order of gyoza. All tasted great, especially the charsui topping. It had more flavor than in other ramen spots I've eaten at. I could've ordered another order of gyoza. \n\nAll in all, a surprisingly good spot that I'll visit again.

I don't come for the customer service, I come for their delicious food, but I haven't had a bad customer service experience until yesterday. \n\nWe were in a group of 6 and being waiting on by a waitress named Sanchi or Sachi, she quickly took our orders but didn't repeat or confirm the orders which is what I'm used to. When the food arrived at the table, two of our orders were incorrect. When we told her about it, she looked concerned and then curtly said something along the lines of \"order it right next time\". I was a little stunned by that, but because there is usually a language barrier with the staff there I brushed it off. I wanted to talk to the waitress again, to let her know if it was a problem, just add the two incorrect orders in our bill. I looked around and saw our waitress with another waitstaff named Archer looking at our table and talking/ laughing-- that didn't rub me the right way, and on top of that we didn't get checked in on until Archer came to the table to basically take over for Sanchi/Sachi, I'm guessing she asked him to take over. I explained our experience to Archer, and he was as kind as someone trying to mitigate a customer service complaint could be in that situation. \n\nMy take away was feeling insulted, but lesson learned, if you're in a big party or just in general, ask the waitress to repeat your order in there-- they usually do, but it happened yesterday that our waitress didn't, and it's loud and busy in that restaurant almost all the time. Again, the food is amazing, I don't go for the customer service. But I don't go to be insulted either, so make sure to protect your own experience there because customer service doesn't seem to be a priority."

So the day we were the the AC was broken and it was hot as shit.  We both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen.  I didn't really see if there was a spicy option but as much as I like my ramen spicy I don't think I would have gotten it with the place being an oven.  \n\nSince this style of ramen is what Hakata Shinsengumi serves I constantly found that I was comparing the two and it's almost unfair.  While the noodles were about the same the broth was only so so and after a while it started to get a little thick.  It was good but I don't think it was good enough to catch a Lyft out to again, at least not until we've been able to try the other ramen joints around Vegas."

Not so bad that I couldn't eat it but it would have been better with a little less miso. Service was very quick and servers were friendly. I ordered my ramen \"spicy\" for a dollar extra but they offer sriaracha and chili oil on the side. Next time, I'd rather give them that dollar as a tip and spice my own ramen. One other bummer is that they do not have hot tea. All in all, I'd come back but i'm not jumping all over myself to do so."

            "review": "Being a pretty lucky teen, I've had the chance to travel, and try many ramen shops around Las Vegas area, California, as well as Japan and Hong Kong. Though it is not up to what I have tried in Japan, it is pretty close. \n\nThis is a small ramen shop at the back of a shopping centre. Max occupancy is probably give or take 25-30 people max with option to sit at the bar or table. Staff gives a very friendly welcome upon entry. A lot of times, this restaurant is quite busy. The restaurant has a nice warm feeling (not due to the heat from cooking) but it resembles some ramen shops i have tried and seen in Tokyo, Japan. \n\nUpon sight of the menu, the front cover has a little story of origins of ramen. When you see the selection of foods they provide, it is not much. This is one of the few places, that i really like, that don't offer a wide variety of foods. Not only do they specialize in what they offer, it is also the only thing they need because of how well made it is. \n\nThey have three broth selections. Tonkotsu, which is a pork bone based broth (usually slowly boiled and simmered for many hours to create a white flavor-filled broth), Miso, and Shoyu (soy-sauce based). Being a fan of tonkotsu ramen, that was the first broth i had tried and loved. Price range for the different soup is i believe 6.95 - 7.95 with Shoyu and tonkotsu being $6.95 and Miso at 7.95 [don't quote me on the pricing but i do remember the miso being more expensive than tonkotsu for some reason... you'd think the one with more work (tonkotsu) would be more expensive]\n\nThey offer a variety of toppings ($1 - $2.50 each) you can choose to add to the ramen as well, ranging from extra pork, green onions, corn, butter, some green vegetable (forgot the name). Hearing great things about their pork, that was what i had ordered as an additional topping. There is also the option of getting extra noodles for a small fee of $2. \n\nTake note, there are two types of noodles they use between the 3 broths. I believe Tonkotsu uses one, while miso and shoyu uses another. They also offer sides like gyoza, pork over rice, etc. \n\nUpon arrival of food, i was amazed how well the ramen looked. The soup had a deep white color, pipping hot freshly made. The soup was not thin but not thick as well. Not sure how to explain, but it was a broth that looked to be filled of flavor. As most people, the first thing to try was the soup. Upon tasting of the soup, I was amazed. The flavor of the soup was rich, extremely flavorful, not too salty or sweet. It was like, perfection was reached. The noodles were a little over al dente which was perfect for ramen. The table has spices that you can add on top of your ramen like chili oil and this spicy spice mix. \n\nThe pork they used was a 1/2 fatty 1/2 meat type of cut formed in a circular shape. Being of Asian origin, it was exactly how I liked it. As said before, the option of extra noodles was available so some of the pork was saved. They amount of noodles you get is quite an amount (usually wont expect too much for \"additional noodles\" but if anything, it may have been a slightly larger serving then that was in the original bowl. The additional noodles is given in a bowl, heated and ready to be thrown into your original soup. \n\nLets just say, every single time, i order a bowl of ramen, additional noodles.. and never have soup left over =] \n\nService is great. Food is great. Price is reasonable. Recommend to many friends and family. One of the best ramen places i've ever been to"

The balance in flavors here is phenomenal. The bowls come out piping hot and perfect!\n\nIf you don't like feeling your arteries clog as you eat, you can go for the Miso Ramen or a mixed broth ramen (which have a different flavor profile, but are also wonderfully paired with the ramen noodles). \n\nTip: get the extras! The pork is DELICIOUS, and if you like eggs with runny creamy yolks, order the flavored egg :) \n\nAlso, this is a tiny little ramen shop reminiscent of Daikokuya in downtown LA.....the wait/line can be super long....but the turn-around time is pretty fast because the little shop gets so hot you'll want to leave as soon as you're done eating!"

            "review": "Monta Ramen is a very intimate, simple, and small ramen shop - they have a small menu as well, but that is good because it makes it easier to choose what to eat; they even scarcely have appetizers, as the only thing they really have is gyoza - other than that, it's either ramen or rice.\n\nWe've had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and tonkotsu shoyu ramen. They serve most of their ramen selection with thin noodles. I found it interesting that their broth offerings were differentiated by chicken, pork, or a combo or both. The spicy tonkotsu ramen comes with pork broth, spicy sauce, and thin noodles - the exact same as the tonkotsu ramen, but with a $1 spicy sauce extra fee. It was alright - a less creamy and oily than usual. The tonkotsu shoyu ramen is a mix of pork and chicken broth, and comes with thin noodles - the broth flavor was quite light, a lot less creamy than what I am used to (which I appreciated), had a slight syrupy consistency, and got pretty salty towards the end. The chashu pieces were extremely tender and fragile - so much that the pieces fell apart upon being picked, which was funny - I enjoyed them, but they were also thin and small slices. They also had an interesting dark brown jelly-like coating on the edges. The kikurage mushrooms and bamboo shoots were finely chopped and good and plentiful, and the amount of fresh green onions was generous. We also ordered kaedama, which was also a generous extra portion of noodles, and which basically used up the rest of the soup within the original bowl of ramen.\n\nOverall, I prefer many other ramen places. However, you get great value at this place especially since you can currently grab a bowl of ramen for $7. The creaminess of tonkotsu broths I am used to is replaced by saltiness, which became too intense at the end. This experience can be easily skipped, but nowadays it's tough to find ramen at this good of a price. The best part of eating here was watching the chefs do cool soup and ladle movements with the ramen bowls."

Two, the place is ridiculously small so not only is the inside crowded but so is the outside; a crowd of people just waiting to be seated. I want to say there were four tables: three that sat four people and one that sat two, plus bar space. Lastly, the food was a bit on the salty side. I ordered the spiciest thing on the menu but it wasn't spicy at all. In fact, I added a ton of spice to it and it still wasn't satisfying to me. And keep in mind that you pay for EVERYTHING. Even a small plate of spice.\n\nGood but not memorable."

This bowl of soup would definitely warm me up in a cold winter night in San Francisco. \n\nI got my ramen soup very fast and the service was also good.\n\nFriends used credit cards for their meals. But I paid my meal in cash."

LOVED it! the menu's simple four type of ramen soups, gyoza, and six side items. SIMPLE and really good!! I got the Tonkatsu ramen, the broth was so flavorful, wasn't greasy and it tasted just right, I got an extra order of Chashu pork and ordered the ramen as is. The serving size was plenty! we also ordered gyoza, at Monta you're able to mix all the necessary ingredients for the gyoza dipping sauce and make it spicier if you want. Anyways, my overall experience was great, and I will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas."

They have a special tonkotsu-shoyu ramen and it was greaaat. The broth was amazing and there was enough goodies in the ramen to make me full! They also have some rice bowls (we tried a small pork belly to share amongst the 5 of us). Even the \"small\" bowl was a pretty decent size.

Not necessarily better but for Las Vegas this might be one of the best. \n\nPros: The Shoyu Ramen and Tonkatsu were so good with extra green onion and chashu. My friend didn't like the chashu (pork) so much because she felt it was a weird texture thing but I loved it, put extra in mine and took hers, so my gain! Tonkatsu noodles were good, and the egg was good but you had to let it sit in the hot broth for awhile, otherwise you'd realize that they tossed a cold egg in there. Service was good, very friendly and nice.\n\nThe biggest cons were the size and the temperature. I got there early so I was able to secure a spot at the bar but outside of that, there were three small table for maybe four, and a group of eight sitting together and that's all there was room for. I couldn't imagine what this place is like during lunch hour or dinner. When I first arrived I didn't think the temperature was that bad since they have fans everywhere. But after eating hot ramen, having a couple Asahis, and being right next to the busy kitchen, the sweat started coming (felt like I was cutting weight for a fight) but it's manageable.

I think the best broth was the tonkatsu-shoyu, because it was a little more complex than the tonkatsu, but also a little less salty as well. The gyoza is solid, and I had some bites of my friend's pork belly rice bowl, which was tasty. It was like a bowl of mom's home-cooked braised pork. We went for lunch on a Sunday, and the wait was short. The restaurant is really small, and it was hellish hot in Vegas, so sitting by the door was very uncomfortable. The little air conditioning units had a tough time cooling the restaurant since people who were waiting for tables kept propping the door open. Because the restaurant is small, our group of 12 had to split up tables, which wasn't a big deal because we wanted to get seated ASAP to eat. It's a 15 minute cab ride from the Strip, and ridiculously cheap. A bowl of noodles is about $7, and it's huge! Most of us girls weren't able to finish the bowl. I will definitely return here to slurp on some noodles on my next trip."

Now the world is good again....  \nI usually go for the the tonkotsu Ramen, but have been known to dip my chopsticks into the tonkotsu-shoyu broth as well.  Both flavors are deep and rich, and each has a creamy texture that can only come from long, slow simmering.  The main difference between these two types of broths comes in the form of a lil more salty punch that the tonkotsu-shoyu has.  \nThe noodles are firm (but not too firm) and thin and have a great mellow flavor that balances out the saltiness of the broths.  On their menu it states that you can get an extra helping of these noodles for a very small fee.  I've tried to finish an extra helping of the noodles twice, and have failed both times.  It is a really huge a portion of food, and in my version of man vs. food, food most defiantly won.  Along with the noodles you get a selection of side items you can add to your Ramen.   I would recommend adding the egg and corn they taste great in the Ramen, and turn it into a really substantial meal.   \nThe last thing I'm going to say about this great Las Vegas Ramen shop is that the staff is, and has always been friendly and attentive (I never go more two minutes without having my water glass filled)."

This also tasted like mushrooms.\n\nBe prepared to wait, because this place is really popular, even when it's hot outside.

            "review": "For the longest time i've heard this place was the go to place for some ramen. Well finally decided to give it a try instead of Ramen Sora where I usually went and had one of the best bowls of Ramen in my experience. I think Ramen in Vegas in general is just super cheap compared to northern Ca, so I definitely give this place a +1 on that ($8 ramen). One of the thing that surprised me most was having the minced pork over rice at a ramen shop. That I was not expecting. \n\nTonkotsu Ramen was what I ordered. It did come with some good flavors, but personally I think I liked the Minced Pork over rice more than I liked the ramen. The flavors were pretty good but they seemed like a flavor i'd get at any other ramen shop. Broth was buttery but felt like it was made me more thirsty than anything. I got this other noodle that I didn't like but my friends had the original type of ramen noodle. I didn't notice that they paired different noodles to different flavors or that you can request to have them changed, so that was a fail on my part. Add an egg and some butter corn and that makes anything close to good. Add some mouth melting tender pork and you should be good to go. \n\nPlace was kinda crowded and we had 9 people so our wait was a little long. There's a nice little boba joint next door, so get some boba and wait in the AC. \n\nTips: \n1) Get the minced pork over rice\n2) Add the egg and pork \n3) Enjoy"

Otherwise, it was a great experience to sit right at the bar in front of the noodle chefs. What is unique with Monta Ramen is that the ramen noodles were a bit thinner that traditional ramen and had texture while eating. Broth was thicker than what I have experienced with ramen soups. The broth was almost like a gravy than soup but extremely tasty. What I discovered was that the locals will take the leftover broth home and purchase an extra side of ramen noodles to go with it. If you ever want to get your pork belly fat fix, the pork belly over rice bowl is a must have. It was well seasoned and the price is very reasonable. The pork belly didn't have any lean parts and basically all fat. If you don't mind that, it's all good."

Get this one!!!\n\nTONKATSU SHOYU RAMEN was good. Broth and noodles are nice. Only comment is there's not a lot of toppings that comes with the original order - 2 pieces of pork chashu and bamboo shoots, I think. We had to order extra topping of egg. I think next time, I'll also order extra pork chashu. \n\nGYOZA is nice. It has a crunch that I like, but still meaty on the inside. Pretty good. \n\nMonta and Sora are the only ramen places from Vegas featured on Ramen Festival in LA and Vegas. Rightfully so because both are awesome. (Didn't get to go to Ramen Fest though.) Contrary to other reviews here, my boyfriend and I think that Sora beats them by a tiny bit due to Sora's broth and toppings. I'd say come taste it yourself and you be the judge. It's very subjective after all. I'll probably go here if Sora is full since they're pretty close to each other.\n\nLast note: I'll be bummed if I move back to San Diego because we don't have awesome ramen places like this. Tajima sucks! Will have to go to LA to get a good one."

Even though a bunch of cheap skates were at Big Wong, this tiny dining room at  Monta was still almost filled to capacity, but still; I found a seat the the counter area. \n\nThe waitress was very impressive, and had it down on helping almost everyone in the dining room, while still taking care of take outs orders.  On the down side, looking how Monta menu is set up,  they have a nickel and dime effect on how you make an order with them.   Never  in my life I would thought of a eating a 12.00 bowl of Ramen which happen that day.\n\nThe Tonsoku stock was pretty good, and ramen could have been cooked a little bit longer, but the thought of paying extra for the corn, nori, boiled egg, and extra noodles kind of got to me.    Don't get me wrong,  I thought  Monta had  the best Tonsoku ramen in Las Vegas, because there wasn't any real competitors at that time.   My only thought going through my mind was if Monta had to match up with Ezogeku in Hawaii (which is pretty good)   This comparison would be like Godzilla battling Pee Wee Herman, because Ezogeku would  waste this place in a heartbeat for quality and value.  That's pretty sad to say a ramen-ya in Hawaii has a better overall package than this so-called Las Vegas heavyweight.. \n\nI never understood why anyone would wait two hours in line to eat  here, because currently  in Las Vegas there more than a few Ramen-ya that recently opened recently and all of them can trade punches with Monta.  In fact, I don't think this place has the best ramen in the Chinatown area, and for sure Monta isn't the best Japanese establishment in this shopping complex.   Take my advice, walk fifty step to the east in the parking lot, and go there.   Sorry Monta,  in my opinion your product doesn't justify the price and the time wasted.  Also, please take a lesson from your neighbor next door, and keep everything clean in the back room.  Getting nailed with a MAJOR health violations from the Southern Nevada Health District is quite an embarrassment.    I\"m Japanese, and know more than a thing or two about Ramen.   In my opinion, Monta is now just in a middle of the pack for Las Vegas ramen scene.  Don't believe in the hype.\n\n."

The hype is no bull and regrettably if you arrive after 5 pm, there are clusters of hungry ass people waiting for an open seat outside & inside.  And dammit, I will wait.\n\nYou cannot go wrong ordering the shoyu ramen, unless you space and not ask for extra char siu aka \"juicy pork butt\".  To really have a ramen equivalent of the \"Calgon-take-me-away\" dreaminess, get extra char siu, egg, nori, menma (marinated bamboo shoots).  Their broth has been made the traditional way.  Really good broth doesn't require lots of salt or shoyu, just enough to enhance its flavor.  I rarely finish the broth, since most places make it way too salty but I cleared my bowl here.\n\nOne tip I will mention is the ramen will come with basic garnish of  green onions.  I made the mistake of ordering it as an extra, and I got a mound of jullienne scallions which was a bit onion overkill.\n\nTheir gyoza is excellent, and compliments a bowl of ramen so don't forget that too.  On top of all that yumminess, super cute&sweet servers that are fast on their feet to clear a table so I can devour more ramen when need be."

I felt I was drinking mashed potatoes at one point.  The flavor was amazing but it came out warm and not hot enough for the weather.  I wish my bowl was just a bit warmer and less heavy.  Other than this the soup was really good.  The chasu pork just melted in my mouth. mmmm\n\nDumplings:  Perfectly fried.  Now I've tried dumplings for many years and this place had one of the best!  Dumplings are supposed to have that golden roast fried look.  Monta's dumplings all had this color.  Once your dumpling has dark brown or black then that mo'fo is burned out and will be waaay to crispy.  If your dumpling doesn't have that golden roast then it probably is just semi fried which is too bland and soggy.  \n\nPork Belly Rice:  This was pretty good too.  Very tender and well marinated meat and enough ginger for a unique taste.  Most people in my party chose this as their favorite. \n\nTon Katsu Ramen:  My friends ordered this Ramen which was pretty good in my opinion.  The description on the menu made it seem very rich in fat and unhealthy but it actually turned out to be less heavy than the Miso I ate.\n\nGood to know where to get my Ramen fix in Las Vegas!"

Everyone else claims it's the best ramen in Las Vegas, maybe, but I haven't been to enough places around to say for certain just yet. So far it's a no for me, because of the way I get sick.\n\n\nGrowing up in Japan with a Chinese family, I know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy the noodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which I hate, they have to be consistant! And on top of that I can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone. \n\nSo like I said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking.

Something I've done since I was a little child, besides the pair together taste great! \n\nThe soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes I feel it's a bit salty (maybe my Asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. Also depends on the one you want, I'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). The noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though I like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. People like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in Japan do), but like I said hit and miss usually it's okay. \n\nOutside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, green onions, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! They also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.\n\nOverall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in Japan. My only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time I've eaten it and since I've stopped it's been okay."

            "review": "I didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good Ramen restaurant after moving out of Hawaii.  However, Monta comes close to filling the void.  Monta is a small Japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  If you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30AM.  There are a few scattered tables, but I prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nMonta makes Tonkotsu ($6.95), Shoyu ($6.95) and Miso ($7.25) Ramen broths.  While all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored Tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  My favorite is the combination Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the Tonkotsu with the salty Shoyu broth.  The thin yellow Ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  The ramen comes with basic toppings (green onions, bamboo shoots, Kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated Chashu pork) however, like all good Ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  The combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.\n\nWe also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small Kimchi fried rice ($6.95).  The gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  Each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  They also serve beer to wash it all down with.\n\nThe service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  So even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  And if you are in the mood for good Ramen, it is worth the wait."

Everything else on the menu looks delicious, but I also just end up ordering ramen since it is a noodle house.  Don't go here with more than 4 people though, because as is common in Japan ramen houses this place is very tiny and can get quite crowded.  I honestly recommend going right when they open."

I am from out of town so I cant really tell you where this place is at since I took a taxi but it seems like the Chinatown of Vegas.  It seems to be sorta hidden in the back of the shopping center but just look for the white sign.\n\nGot here around 12pm and there was a slight wait (nothing compared the wait when we were leaving).  Sat down and the friendly waitress took my order: Shoyu Ramen with corn and also the small fried rice (my friend said i had to get it no matter what) and yes I know thats a lot of carbs.\n\nShoyu Ramen:  my ramen came out with extra chasu and with no corn.  the waitress quickly realized this and immediatly gave me some corn on the side and didnt charge me for the extra chasu (kudos to her to rectify the situation).  The broth was very good and not overly salty.  I consider this one of the better ramens that I have eaten.  But the thing that stood out the most to me are the noodles.  Wow! This has got to be one of the best noodles ive eaten at any ramen joint and I have been to many in NY, CA and Hawaii.  Many places forsake the noodles and focus too much on the broth and chasu but very very good noodles.\n\nFried Rice: this was the dish my friend kept raving about and keep telling me to order.  I am not a huge fried rice person but it was pretty darn good! I devoured it within minutes of it coming out and didnt even leave a spec for my friend.\n\nVery good place I will definitely come again when I go to Vegas."

Tip-move the fans to the kitchen to help the workers out but it was too cold for us.\n\nI ordered my Pork Ramen w/out mushrooms and they placed the wrong bowls in front of us, my dinner companion was about to take a bite and the waitress like snagged it out from under him to swap ours around.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing. It has to be at least 3 cups of liquid, plus noodles and some very small bits of pork.  Get yours with the hard boiled egg.

Stopped by here twice during the last week of 2015. \n\nFIRST VISIT: Weekday lunch hour. 16 people ahead of me. Wait time 50 min. Had the Tonkotsu ramen ($6.95), Takana Fried Rice ($6.95), and hot green tea ($1.75). The ramen was not the best I've had, but pretty darn delicious. Good coloration and consistency of the broth, which was very savory and appetizing. I drank the whole thing! Good combination of toppings with adequate amounts. Comparable to traditional flavors found in Japan. If I had to be picky, I'd say the noodles itself were just okay. As for the Takana fried rice, it was as traditional as you can get. Reminded me of my childhood in Japan. If you've never had such flavors before, it will be a good experience. The savory flavor of the rice complemented the pickled mustard leaf which had a subtle spiciness to it. All this, including tax & tip, is a good deal for 20 bucks.\n\nSECOND VISIT: Weekday around 9:30 pm. 8 people ahead of me. Wait time 35 min. Had the Kuro ramen ($8.95), mini Mentaiko ($2.95), kimchi side ($1.00) and hot oolong tea ($1.75). Kuro ramen has noticeable black garlic oil in the broth which is delicious. Thick rich savory taste. Again, if I had to nitpick, the noodles itself were average. The mentaiko was also very average. Straight forward and very traditional Japanese dish. No real wow factor but I enjoyed it. The marinated cod roe was spicy and complemented the dish well. Kimchi was not overbearing. It was tasty but seemed store bought. Total cost came out to be under $20 which is a great value. The hot teas served on both visits were provided in unopened cans which were heated. \n\nOverall, this place has wonderful ramen and the monetary value is outstanding. The star of the show was the broth. Very complex flavors with depth. You won't be disappointed. As for the restaurant itself, the layout and setting was very Japanese. I will visit again the next time I visit Vegas which should be next month. If you've ever wondered what a typical ramen place in Japan is like, then this should be a good experience for you."

That being said, Monta is not my favorite, and while I would happily come back, I probably won't too often since my favorite is so close.\n\nI am all about the miso ramen, so I enjoyed that here as well.  I read Yuhi K.'s review before ordering so I also enjoyed the mentaiko and made sure to use togarashi.  These were excellent suggestions so I'll pass them on as well, but check out her review for more details.  \n\nThe bottom line for me was that the broth lacked the deep, developed flavors you can get elsewhere, but they have some great options--especially for the kosher minded.  I have had a couple experiences where an individual I try to take to ramen isn't into the traditional pork broth.  Monta takes care of that by offering chicken base.

The staff is nice enough and the service is fine when it comes to refills or getting extra noodles for your broth. No one is overbearing, but they don't snub you either -- just right.\nAs far as the ramen, I had Tonkotsu-Shoyu with chashu, nori and shredded green onions. The broth was perfect and the chashu was tender with the right amount of fat. Ramen is considered to be Japan's ultimate comfort food, and I can see why."

This particular issue of the LP focuses on ramen and the way it's adored and eaten and made in Japan.  Different broths and combinations of broths and perfectly cooked noodles and various garnishes and seasonings that adorn th bowls of love that are slurped in thousands of little ramen houses tucked into the most unassuming little nooks and crannies throughout Tokyo.\n\nAnywho, I've been geeking over ramen literature and got to thinking maybe it was high time I got back to Monta to try to get me a bowl.  The last and only time I tried to get a bowl the wait was half an hour at 2pm in the dead heat of the summer.  There are only around a dozen and half seats up in there so it can be hard to snag one.\n\nThis time I waited for my bowl and I'm glad I did.  So good!  Only 3 different bowls on the menu.  I love that.  In ramen joints in Japan the ramen masters only serve one thing, ramen, and do it for decades.  It's artistry and perfection.  I don't know bout them bowls out there out in J, but for my first serious bowl of ramen and the proximity of the shop, I fell in love with my bowl and slurped up every last drop.\n\nYum."

I think the soap of the tonkotsu ramen is good and the chashu which comes with the ramen is VERY GOOD. Everytime we order the ramen, we will pay $2.5 for 4 more pieces of the chashu because it is just so good. For the chashu bowl, i think it's soso because the chashu is fried. Therefore it's not as good as those that are in the ramen. And i think the pork belly bowl is soso too, nothing special about it. For the fried rice, I think it tastes good and smells good. I had only tried the \"fried rice\". I didnt try the one with kimchi and veggie. And for the gyoza, I think it is okay. Nothing special about it too.\n\nOverall, I would recommend you to try there ramen and fried rice.

I absolutely love their broth (I am a big fan of salt after all). At times, we will order gyoza and/or fried rice to go along with our orders of ramen, and that is usually a good way to round out the meal.\n\nThe Service (4 out of 5):\nI love how fast the turnover of tables is after a patron as left because there is usually a line of people waiting to get in. This is my only true gripe about Monta; I just wish that they had just a little more seating room. HINT: If you go here for lunch, they open at 11:30am......just make sure that you are a couple of minutes early otherwise you will be waiting about 20-30 mins to get seated.\n\nThe Price (5 out of 5): \nOk, I guess that this could be better if it were FREE, but come on, that's not going to happen! But, you shouldn't be paying any more than $20 pp here (more like $10-12 pp if you're not getting any extras and/or having water as your drink). \n\nOVERALL:\nMonta Ramen is at the top of the pack for Japanese ramen noodle shops in Las Vegas in my opinion!"

At that place I was able to customize it to the skies: choice of the regular pork broth, or chicken, or even vegetable.  Too salty?  \"No prob, we can do low sodium.\" And I was able to have chicken or shrimp (can't remember which) instead of some fatty pork.\n\nIt wasn't that way at Monta.  What you see is what you get, complete with photos.  And since even as a kid I was nauseated by even the tiniest bit of fat on any meat or poultry, I couldn't stand the pork that was in the bowl and had to remove it.  I'll take a nice, lean piece of pork loin any time, but not the stuff that makes up the choices at Monta.  The broth was pretty decent, and I'm a sucker for noodles of any kind, but the ramen here will never be my comfort food.\n\nWhile service was quick, the tiny and cramped space does not lend itself to comfort or relaxation, so fast service was definitely welcome.  \n\nI don't disagree with all of those who love this place.

I think I'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee fried rice to be honest. It was moist and tasty. So much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. There are restaurants that makes it super dry but Monta made it perfectly. Obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. It was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. We ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.\n\nI would seriously come back only to get the fried rice...I'm really curious about the takana fried rice too.

At first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. However, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. There are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. Most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. My friend and I sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. The seating may feel cramped for some people, but I really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. \n\nOn to the good stuff. I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with the regular house fixings and my friend had the Shoyu ramen with thin noodles. I was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as I tried it. The broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. I found the soup very flavorful, but I had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since I like my ramen spicy. The Shoyu ramen was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. We both had a can of green tea to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. My only gripe was the fact that I was not completely full when I left, which is mostly my own fault. They offer the option of extra noodles, which I will surely do next time. The gyoza and fried rice are also on the list to try in the future. \n\nAnother great aspect is the price. The total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. A great deal for any sit down place. Bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. I will definitely be going back."

The broth was super flavorful and the noodles were chewy, just the way I like it!! :) IN addition, i got to try  the pork belly rice bowl (forget the name) but it was just PHENOMENAL. Even though I was super full, I couldn't stop stuffing myself with extra bites of it! \n\nAlthough this place is small and the lines inevitable, I definitely think it was worth the wait! :)"

            "review": "I'm so glad my gf found this place on yelp for our final lunch at Vegas!\n\nWe ordered:\n- Tonkatsu Ramen: Absolutely wonderful smooth & milky pork-based broth. My favorite ramen is at shin sen gumi, and this bowl of ramen was very comparable, if not better. I also added toppings of a hard boiled egg and extra slices of pork - they gave 6 extra slices in addition to the two slices of pork that came with the bowl by default. I decided to avoid the kimchi because I didn't want the Korean toppings to dominate the Japanese broth. Noodles were cooked perfect, and you can order extra noodles for $1.50.\n- Shoyu Ramen: This is the darker one, I believe it's miso/soy based. My gf had this, and I tried the broth and it seemed equally as delicious.\n- Gyoza: It's like lightly grilled potstickers\n- Fried Rice: typical fried rice as expected - not something to die for, but good.\n- Kimchi Fried Rice: Pretty much exactly like the fried rice, except that it had a bit of the tangy flavor that the kimchi added\n- Pork bellow bowl: This was my favorite out of the fried rice bowls. Lightly cooked, tender, moist and juicy pork belly strips layered on top of white rice. Definitely worth getting along with the ramen.\n\nService was fantastic. Our group of 5 was sixth on the waitlist, but it moved pretty fast; we waited maybe about 20 or so minutes.\n\nCliff Notes: Tonkatsu Ramen with hardboiled egg and extra pork. Pork Belly bowl."

Actually, the reason why I even decided to check this place out is because the day before I was at the Japanese Curry spot just a couple hundred feet away (in the same plaza) and noticed a long line at Monta Ramen. I was curious. Why were so many people waiting outside to eat ramen? Well, I needed to found out! So the very next day, my friend and I arrived around 11:15am (the place opens at 11:30am for lunch). There were already a few people in line waiting for the doors to open. I peeked inside. It's very small! There's only about 6 tables and a few seats at the bar. We got seated at 11:30am and when I looked out the window, there was already a line. \n\nWe ordered their top two special daily ramens: Spicy Tonkatsu and Black garlic Oil Kuro ramen. Both are fantastic! Very flavorful and unique! I've never tasted anything like the Kuro ramen before. Truthfully it looks gross cuz it's black and oil, but damn the ramen tastes soooo ono (good)!!!! The noodles are perfectly cooked, al dente! The service is fast and friendly (they kind of want you out of there quick, though! lol). \n\nIf you're ever in Vegas and you love ramen, you def have to check out Monta Ramen. You won't regret it! The long line is worth the wait."

It's like the most amazing thing I've tasted in my entire freakin' life.\n\nThe restaurant is quite a modest noodle house, very small, and they have a simple menu. It seems this kind of place would just be something to overlook. But NO. Their ramen is the best ramen I've had.\n\nTheir broth is very rich and flavorful-- I've been to ramen houses were they put a lot of salt and MSG in the broth for its lack of flavor--not here! Very rich. Noodles were not too hard nor too soft, just right in the middle.\n\nBut, the pork. Dear god the PORK\n\nNext time I go I will get extra chashu pork in my soup. Their pork literally just falls apart. I've had soft pork before, but that was because I'd get nothing but cuts of fat. Here, the meat is so tender and flavorful. I don't know what they do to it, but it's just downright amazing.\n\nEach one of us got a different bowl of ramen they offered, so we pretty much ordered the whole ramen menu. Each one is delicious. Their shoyu (soy sauce broth) is the original ramen, but it is very delicious. I enjoyed mine. Everything else was delicious as well.\n\nWe got a chashu bowl, and it was a simple bowl of chashu pork with rice over it, but it was just the best thing ever. The pork is so amazing, I could go on and on about it forever.\n\nTheir kimchi rice is also quite good! Not too spicy, but it does give a kick.\n\nYou really can't get anything \"bad\" or \"ok\" here; everything on the menu is amazing.\n\nOur group of friends were rock climbers and just got done climbing in Red Rocks for the day, so they were quite famished. We each ordered one bowl of ramen to ourselves, split a chashu pork bowl, one plate of gyoza, and one plate of kimchi fried rice, but they decided to get extra noodles. Nope, even famished rock climbers could barely finish what we got. And the price we paid for was so small for the generous helping of delicious food we got!\n\n5 stars for Monta! Cheap prices, excellent food, and great service."

There are actually a few other asian things in this plaza.  I was happy we found this spot.  It's a legit Japanese Ramen place, we tried the Kuru ramen which was black and garlicy. I thought it was good, not amazing, but something different.  You don't get to select how firm you want your noodles, I felt they were on the firm side so if you like that.  Price is good, I think about $6.75 for a bowl of ramen and you can get refills on noodles if you wish.  You can also add additional toppings like egg, etc.  \n\nWhat was a must-do was getting a side of the pork belly bowl.  Think of it as an upgraded Yoshinoya beef bowl.  Instead, it's pork belly, the taste is strong juicy.  It is a little much to get ramen and a small side of pork belly bowl but I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nI want to come back and try fried rice with my ramen but I don't know if i'll be able to not get the pork belly again.  I would try a different ramen next time to see how they do on the traditional items.  Solid place for authentic Japanese Ramen and Sides."

I personally am a ramen fan in general so I like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to Monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.\n\nWe all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, I think more like 10oz-ers? Still it was a refreshing way to start the meal. \nShared the pickled greens fried rice and the pork belly rice bowl. Fried rice was cooked well and flavorful, the pork belly bowl was even better. The fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath. \n\nFor ramen I got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. The chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. Not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes I prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. So depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. Noodles were cooked perfectly. \n\nThe place is typical small Japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. The waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour.

Feeling the cold disparity I opted for the chick and park broth tonkotsu ramen and gave the pork that came with my soup to my boyfriend (obviously this was a plus for him ) \n\nI neglected to notice the specials board, or rather the server neglected to tell me about it, but next time I'll be trying their Spicy Tonkotsu soup. Would have given this 4 stars, but sometimes the attitude of the servers is a bit shaky. Also, sitting at the counter near where the door opens isn't the greatest either."

My friend who order the same broth as I did got the same noodles as I did, but everyone else got the regular noodles.

Oh man, the umami. The wait (and there ALWAYS is one) is WELL worth it. Whether it's 10 minutes for lunch or a 30-60 minute wait for dinner, your olfactory glands, umami super sensors and full warm belly will thank you profusely. \n\nI am a massive fan of the basic tonkotsu, always with a nitamago (soft boiled, soy sauce-seasoned egg), with a spicy iteration thrown in the routine every so often. I am also slightly obsessed with their kimchi fried rice, on which I pile on pink pickled ginger. They should probably start charging me for the pickled ginger, as I definitely take advantage of the free-for-paying-customers-with-the-notion-it-will-be-used-sparingly jar of the condiment/dish enhancer. $2.95 Asahi on tap??

It's about 10-12 min ride from the strip via uber in non traffic so swing out there after a day of gambling or beach clubbing and pick up a very delicious bowl of ramen. \n\nWe sampled several dishes while we were there. I tried the tonkotsu, the spicy tonkotsu, some of the fried rices, and the gyoza. \n\nAs with all Japanese dishes I hardly detected a major difference between the regular and the spicy so that is kinda moot. The tonkotsu itself is creamy and a tad bit too salty but very filling. I didn't even finish my soup so I'm not sure if I blame the noodle portions or my \"diet\" that I was on. You have the option of selecting your type of noodle from udon and thin style I believe. I went with the regular thin noodle and was not disappointed in the least. \n\nThe fried rice was not to my taste so I had one bite and that was about it. Nothing negative to say about it but just wasn't a winner for me.\n\nWhat knocked my rating down 1 star was the way the seating was done. I observed a table with enough for our party get given to a party with three less people than ours which in turn if they had just waited one second for them to clean the table they could have given them the appropriate size table. We had to wait thru two of those moments and I watched as the host just put people around helter skelter. \n\nOur waitress was pleasant but she did forget one of our orders and we had to remind her. Can't blame her, it was towards the end of the shift so be prepared for end of day exhaustion because some of these people work really late."

I don't call myself very knowledgeable but I sure as hell know what I like to eat. The best ramen place that I've tried is Ippudo, which is located in Manhattan NY. However, Monta does come close.\n\n\nMonta is quite a small restaurant and it has one of those homely feels to it. One thing I didn't quite like was how stuffy it was. I went during one of the warm days, it wasn't even hot, but all they had was fans and I couldn't even feel them. So the place had pretty poor circulation and stuffy. I'd hate to see what it's like during an actual summer temperature where it hits over 100 degrees. \n\n\nI had their tonkotsu ramen with corn -- definitely recommended. Their broth is rich and full of flavor. It is yummy. However, because of how rich and yummy the broth is, I don't suggest adding an egg to it. Because once you do, the egg loses its flavor and the broth overpowers it. So no point. \n\n\nI would've given this place five full stars if it were not for the waitress that helped us. Oh the service was fine throughout our meal. When we first took our orders down, she offered us, \"Would you like everything on one check or split checks?\" We were a party of 8. Obviously, some had cash and some didn't so we would prefer the latter. So we answered with, \"Split checks would be nice :)\" But then she responds with, \"I could do that but could you please not do 8 separate checks? It's a little bit too much.\"\n\nI'M SORRY? Really, why did you even bother to offer? \n\nI didn't feel like arguing or bothering so we just went with one check. You don't offer something then take back your offer. Or at least lay your own terms down before you finish offering. Thank you. \n\n\nBut hey. Food's good. :) Just that tiny bit irked me."

Not a sushi-ya or a restaurant serving ramen, or a ramen-ya being a full restaurant.\n\nMonta's  Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen started good, and was good for awhile, and went to \"a little too salty\" on the ramen soup, but I know they can do better.   Went back today after more than a year, and it was back to normal. Still a small place, busy as usual, but, I was in and out in about 30 - 40min.  I ate pretty quick, too. I didn't order any extra toppings because I want it to taste it the way it is, plus, I ordered a side of pot stickers and a side of Kimchee Fried Rice.   It might be my imagination, but, I think their Kimchee Fried Rice got better.  I don't remember if it originally had any bits of shiitake mushrooms in it, but it had it, and it was delicious! \n\nThe gyoza (pot stickers)  I ordered (not in the photo) was a gyoza.  Nothing special.  Frankly, I've had better gyoza, and I can too, make a better one (with 30+ years of professional cooking and non-professional experience).  However, their specialy is ramen. Tonkotsu Shoyu is difficult to balance in the first place.  I can taste the pork broth with the shiitake mushrooms, and a hint of something... not Japanese.  May be Chinese, or perhaps that \"hihachi\" pepper from Okinawa?  Great job Monta!\n\nTheir other ramen like miso base and shoyu base have always been good.\nRamen soups are always fascinating, because there are so many things you can do to it.  There is no \"fixed\" or \"Orthodox\" style, or, whatsoever.  It has to taste good at your first sip of the soup, hence, very challenging.\n\nFurthermore, I've always loved the way their workers  are \"up beat\" and energetic, how a small and busy place like that should be."

            "review": "Finally! A very good Ramen joint in Vegas. This place is much more the real Japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) Togoshi Ramen.\n\nMonta is in a small strip mall on Sprint Mountain Rd, just West of Decatur. It is very easy to miss as you go by. And the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. They only accept cash so beware.\n\nI recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. Like others on this forum, I grew up eating fantastic ramen all over Japan. And have long been searching... I was elated when Santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like Orenchi (Cupertino, CA) that are very much like the ramen I used to know in Japan... started to pop up.\n\nI'd like to preface this review with the fact that I like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so I am usually biased towards that. Monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Miso, and new (at least it said new today) Tonkotsu Shoyu which is a combination of the Tonkotsu and Shoyu broths.\n\nTonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. The Shoyu uses chicken broth (according to Monta), but I also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. Tonkotsu, and Tonkotsu Shoyu uses thin straight noodles. Shoyu and Miso uses the thick wavy noodles. Each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped green onions. There are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.\n\nKaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. This is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. This is one of the reasons why I do not like places that have a \"Large\" size. By the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. I commend Monta for doing the kaedama the right way.\n\nAnyway, I was @ Monta today, Thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! It took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. OK... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in Vegas....\n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. My wife had the Shoyu with nitamago. We also had gyoza. In the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. One guy that does the ramen, another that does the fried rice and others. And with the packed house, the service was slow.\n\nBut when the ramen finally came, I was not disappointed. Despite my doubts, the Tonkotsu Shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. My wife's Shoyu, I believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the Tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. I finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's Shoyu/Chicken broth.\n\nThe noodles... My thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. But because of its thinness, by the time I got half way through my ramen (and I'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. Next time, I will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as I do at Kyushu Jyangara in Tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). My wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  If I can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the Tonkotsu ramen.\n\nThe boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. I like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. But nevertheless it was still good. The Char shu was one the the better ones I had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. The slices were on the thin side, but I got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). \n\nIn summary both the Tonkotsu Shoyu and Shoyu ramens were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. Too many times, I have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.\n\nThe gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, I though were also very good. I would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. The flavor is also very good, however, I like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.\n\nIn the end though, I give Monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. Monta, in my book, share the top honors with Orenchi in Cupertino,"

It gets insanely busy. But I like to get pick up after work and make the noodles at home. It's perfect. Delicious food and a must eat in Vegas."

The only downside is that this restaurant is packed like CRAZY during lunch/dinner times and such a small place. But because they have attentive waitresses who try to seat people ASAP and such heartwarming ramen, I really don't mind the wait for the speed my food comes out! I highly recommend this place, especially for people who haven't experienced passed package ramen!! My staple order is the ton Katsu shoyu ramen (idk if I even typed that correctly) BE AWARE: they will not seat you until your whole party is there"

No distractions, nothing to take away from the quality of the food.\n\nAnd Robert Irvine would be proud of this place: their menu is one page.\n\nThe food is absolutely fantastic. I love the tonkotsu ramen, but often times I have a hard time picking which one. So I end up being a pain in the ass to the waitress... haha. I do love how you are able to customize the bowl to your tastes (i.e. adding corn, extra seaweed, more pork, etc.)\n\nBest ramen in Vegas hands down.\n\nPS, the place does get packed.. on account of it only being able to seat maybe 20 people? (or less) but it's part of the \"small and cozy\" factor!"

Fact is though, my wife and I have STILL only been in the US for less than 1 month.... Soooo the Japanese ramen of our home, which is Japan lol, still is heavy on our pallet. \nOk so I ENJOYED it. My wife said the soup (broth) was very good and very authentic. However, she had a problem with the noodles. She said the broth was real, the look was real, but it was kinda mind messing because the noodles were too soft for the kind she ordered. She used a bunch of Japanese words of course but I'm just giving the typical American consumer the gist. Taste is 3 stars, authenticity is 3-4 stars, seating is like wow, PACKED 24/7. Price was fine... I mean, my wife felt bad for being critical about a ramen place and her Japanese blood came out when she stared being thankful instead for even being able to have Japanese food in this American desert. Her final decision was, for a western country, this was pretty solid ramen. 3 stars! \nSo that's that. It's not the worst... And my American ass honestly doesn't know the one details and difference... So it's whatever.  Don't take my word for it... Thousands have reviewed this place. Do take my wife's word though... For America this is a 4 or 5 star... In reality (in Japan) this would be like a 2... Not the worst but in the homeland your ramen gotta be dope to compete. So this might sound harsh but just saying... OVERALL... It's worth it. If you can get in (always packed) please go in... If there's a long line (like out the door, which is common as this place is popular) walk catty corner to Curry Zen in same parking lot... Personally, Japanese curry is my FAV... But this is about Monta.... And Monta is a 3star ramen shop in the world... But closer to 5 stars a far as America goes. Cheap too... Good on a budget. \u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059"

            "review": "Finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in Vegas - Monta Noodle House.  Conveniently located on Spring Mountain, right next to the super busy Raku.  (Smart business choice I would say.)\n\nThis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  Their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (A couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\nI went for their most popular dish - Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.95).  The main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  This results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  It automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and green onions.  Their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the Chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nThe Husband went for the Miso Ramen ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  This was also good, and quite filling.\n\nWe also shared a regular order of the Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75).  It sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  I adore pork belly and the next time I come here, I'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  It's fatty and good.  \n\nA side dish we added on was the Takana Mustard Leaf ($1.50).  You can have this on the side or in your broth.  It's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  It's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  Other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or green onions.\n\nThere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - Shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  You can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"Kaedama.\"  Other dishes available are gyoza, fried rice, kim chee fried rice, takana fried rice, cha siu bowl, and mini mentaiko (marinated polluck roe).\n\nService was good.  With two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  It's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nUpdate!  \nI returned the following month for my own bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl.  This time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  Guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day."

Even at 9:30pm, but they were able to get the four of us in within 15-20 mins, which wasn't too bad.  I'd recommend going with one other person rather than a large group though.  The place is pretty tiny, and the smaller tables turn quicker, and you also usually have the option to sit at the bar.  I ordered the tonokatsu ramen and it was definitely worth the wait.  The soup was deep in flavor, delicious, and pork was extremely tender and yummy.  The soup was just a tad salty for me, which made me want to order more ramen (which you can do), to soak up all the yumminess.  If it were just a little less salty, I probably would have just stuck a straw in it.  I will definitely be coming back during my future visits to Vegas!"

People were walking in from parking across the street. But hooray for the selections of neighboring restaurants!\n\nYes service is quick and attentive. They clean off tables and seating areas as soon as guests are through. We got bar seats facing the kitchen and were able to watch their process. They wear gloves and hair bandanas. Saw how they keep their soup bowls hot. Saw how routine it was to put noodles, ingredients, and broth. Saw how busy the workers were. Our orders came out quickly after ordering.\n\nYes their ramen soup is totally delish! Hot, tasty, comfy, and a good amount of ingredients. Their awards and acknowledgments on the walls live up to the best value. Absolutely enjoyed the flavor! There was enough in our bowls for another soupy meal for later. Wish I could've finished it cuz I was having a needy moment. The rest of the soup to go - so it is so...\n\nNo there is not a lot of room for a popular place to eat. After a tiny bit of parking frustration, then there's the seating wait, and the standing, and the crowd. I wish they had better space; and perhaps that is what's in plans for such a successful place. Real awesome for them! Good luck on the bigger space.\n\nNo 3 whole stars or 3.5 - what's up Jo... Why're you jippin' on the stars?! Oh no see...

The only downside is the wait-be prepared and don't come when you are already starving unless you enjoy torturing yourself! Good things come to those who wait, don't miss out on my new go-to spot of Vegas!"

Don't get me wrong, this place has good Ramen but I've definitely had better elsewhere.\n\nI ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with nori and corn.  Personally my broth was a little bit on the salty side and my best friend felt the same way.  We also ordered gyoza, which I liked very much but that's about it.  We did arrive about 12:30 A.M. and I'm assuming we got the last batch since all the workers seemed to be cleaning up the place as we finished up our Ramen.  They also forgot to give us the red ginger you usually get on the side.  My boyfriend and I didn't realize this until we headed out the door after seeing the Ramen add-ons were compiled together at the bar ready to be stored for the next business day.\n\nIf you plan to go maybe try and go during normal/peak hours.  The way I see it, it's like ordering french fries in the wee hours of the night, when they are usually sitting out too long and become stale and soggy.  Basically, you might not get the best batch of broth... \n\nYeah, sorry Monta Ramen, there's just no chemistry between you and me.  Good try though.\n\nLina Chen"

Right now, they are offering the tonkotsu mixed with the shoyu broth.  It has pieces of pork and the tonkotsu noodles.  This is a little less filling but does not have enough of the pork taste for me.  My husband prefers the noodles in the shoyu so we might try to get those noodles in the tonkotsu/shoyu.  We shall see.  I have not tried the miso as most people tell me it is very thick and salty.  I can't tear myself away from the tonkotsu - it is so good!  I'll just stick with that.\n\nI highly recommend getting the takana mustard leaf in your ramen.  It is very, very flavorful.  Also, they have containers of fresh garlic and ginger scattered about the place.  If there isn't one on your table, just ask.  It's a great addition to the ramen if you are a fan of garlic and/or ginger.  Free addition to the ramen! The gyoza is good too, but keep in mind, you will likely be surprisingly full after just some ramen.\n\nIf the place is crowded, they will set up a waitlist that you have to write your name on.  It's outside taped to a table by the door.  If they are really busy, they may not stop to explain this to you, so just keep an eye out for the list if the place is full.\n\nIt's true, as some of the reviewers say, that it is unbearably hot inside the restaurant during the summer. But they are good with the beverage refills (Asahi on tap!) and just be thankful you don't have to work there all day! Plus, when it was too warm inside, the turnover was quick so the wait for a table was shorter.  Now that it is colder outside, it seems like people linger and chat.  But still, turnover is decent so if there is a wait, don't despair.  You need to spend $10 minimum to use a credit card."

Its in the same strip mall as Raku on Decatur/ Spring Mtn. \n\nMonta reminds us of Japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nThe menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nAnother favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.\n\nTheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.\n\nIts easy to over order food at Monta. Because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nMonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\nArooha!!!!!"

Another reason why you'll have to wait is that the dining room can probably fit about 30 dining guests at each time, half of the guests will need to be on the bar table. Me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). The menu was very simple - noodle, fried rice or some small variety of specialty. There are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy tonkotsu ramen. We also ordered a mini mentaiko bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). I would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. The ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). You also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - I think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it. For us, the bowl of rice does the job. The rice is nothing special and almost had no flavor. I just seasoned the rice with the broth of the ramen I had. Overall, not bad, and it is definitely worth the price. But if you don't have much time in Vegas, you can safely skip this place as it is not worth that much of wait, unless you really want to save money in your trip."

We've never gone here without having to wait in line but the wait is not that bad and always worth it. The ramen is rich and hearty. We've tried to recreate it a few times at home but we never even come close. The price point is awesome, unbelievably low even for Chinatown."

Its certainly a 4+ star place in LV.  \n\nWe both got the tonkotsu ramen which was pretty good although more miso-y than I expected.  I got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu I've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  The gyoza was just ok.  My wife (Japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of Japan.  \n\nThis certainly beats the hell out of the prices of Yokohama Kaigenro and I am psyched its so close to my place.  \n\nI'm more of a shoyu ramen guy which is what I'll get next time."

I think miso usually is the strongest flavor unless you have some serious broth.  But their broth is a bit lighter.  Combined with Shoyu it was just saltly I guess.  Not very complex flavors.  The gyo za is average.  Doubt they make it themselves.  Probably try the miso instead of the tonkotsu shoyu if I ever come again.  Not a bad place, especially considering vegas, but overall not the best."

Was it an OFF night or something for them the night that I decided to enjoy my first meal in Vegas when I landed?\n\nI've heard only amazing things about Monta Ramen from fellow online Yelpers. But lemme tell ya, I should have listened to my actual Yelp foodie friends from the Bay Area. They told me, \"Monta ain't all that.\" \n\nDon't get me wrong, service was pretty good actually. Maybe too good...cuz my ramen came out within minutes of ordering. How is that even possible? Do they have it pre-made in the back and it's just microwaved or something?\n\nI had very high hopes for Monta, sadly...I will never return. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. TOO SALTY. And even if you ask for less salty...you're still gonna feel bloated as shizz from the sodium.\n\n2. Noodles are NO BUENO. They're like thin vermicelli noodles. I like my ramen noodles thick and with the right kinda chew!\n\n3. My soft boiled egg got cold within minutes. Hmmmm :-|\n\n4. Spicy means weaksauce-American-spicy to them.\n\n5. Oh yes, and there's always a wait here too. Why, I have no clue...\n\nDo yourself a favor. Go across the street to Ramen Sora and have a real bowl of delicious ramen. \n\nYou can tell I was quite excited to sit down and enjoy my meal when I first got to Monta...check out my YouTube vlog for that weekend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN4ggfu52w&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA"

Small booth tucked in a corner. No heavy signage just three folks sweatin in the polstering heat serving up what unbeknowst to me the best ramen showcasing. Found out that they have a location out in Las Vegas and decided to take some family members out there to give it a try.\n\nGot there 30 minutes before they opened. All of us hungover from the night before, only to see that there is a line about to form! We turned off our engines parked and snagged in front of the line. in 30 minutes I kid you not, at least 40 others joined. Luckily we were in front. \n\nStarving and dehydrated. We ordered. I settled for the Spicy Tonkotsu with the added green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Added additionally the Nori + Nitamago. (dry seaweed and hard boiled egg, respectively) some corn, etc. My gal got the Tonkotsu BLACK. and whoa. I've never had a ramen to that degree ever in my 30 years of life. What is this? A smoky flavored broth? almost like a bbq tang? THIS was my highlight. It was unusual. It was weird. But in the most gnarliest of ways a ramen can be. I highly recommend that one. \n\nfyi: their Chasu Bowl is one of the better ones I have experienced in all of CA. Definitely worth it as a side dish. \n\nAs a matter of fact. I am visiting MONTA again for MDW (Memorial Day Weekend) I am coming back. It wouldn't be a successful Vegas trip without a visit to Monta. Seriously best Ramen in town."

I like the wavy thick noodles that is offered in the miso ramen and shoyu ramen.  The thin straight noodles are good too but I like the thick kind.  You can choose from Tonkatsu (pork), Shoyu, Tonkatsu-Shoyu, or Miso broth.  You can make any broth spicy.  There is also a new broth that is the Tonkatsu broth with black garlic oil.  Sounds yummy.  The broths are all great and there are yummy add-ins.  I always add corn.  If you are feeling extra indulgent add some butter!  I like to wear a dark colored shirt so that you can't see all of the splash marks from the soup. \n\nThe sides are good to start off with.  The fried rice is actually pretty amazing.  The chunks of meat in the fried rice are delicious.  Gyoza is always a safe bet too.\n\nExpect to wait.  That is the only reason I am not here more often.  I hate waiting to eat.  This restaurant is tiny and there are a lot of Monta fans out there.  You can try their other location Monta Chaya in Henderson if you are closer to that side of town.

This make the broth super rich and I can't see myself finishing it after a few bite if that was my noodle...too much. My ramen was super salty that it makes me super dehydrated. My favorite part of soup is always the broth, and if the broth is too much for me to handle, there's no point of eating it. The pork though, on the other hand was very tender and delicious. \n\nI'll give it another try when I go back to Vegas, just because I love ramen that much. \n\nRamen: around $7/bowl (not too bad).

I went there with four friends at 3:00~3:30 and sat on the right next to the door. \n\nAs soon as we arrived, a waitress came to get drinks order from us. When we got drinks the other waitress came to our table  in a minute after and tried to get orders. even though, we didn't have enough time to order, we tried not to take so long time. Since three of us are working as server in japanese restaurants for while. For sure, we weren't taking lots of  time to order. but this waitress was giving us mean look and had negative attitude.\n\nWe ordered pork belly rice, fried rice, one pot sticker, two tonkotsu shoyu ramen with egg, one miso ramen with egg, and one miso ramen without egg. Cook made a mistake and  put an egg on both of miso ramen. It was totally fine with us because sometimes people make mistakes. Moreover, we got an free egg, but the problem was waitress's attitude. \nI definitely remeber that she never apologized to us but said that \"chef made a mistake, you guys can have it\" and turned around and left. \nThat happening embrassed everyone of us and we thought we did something wrong to server or etc. \n\nAfter we all finished our meal, she just \"dropped\" check on our table. We tried to split in five ways, but we left four cards on a bill and talked to each other that \"we gotta leave maximum 2 or 3cards.... Its too much\" and so on. But this mean look waitress came to us and saw four cards stacked on a bill ( actually, we had five people in a group but one person did not left her card on a bill, so total we left four cards at the first place ) And said 10 bucks minimum to swipe and go throw, understand?? With annoying face Then left\n\nWe TOTALLY all felt insulted and humiliated.Qh\n\nBecause our total was 53.xx dollars which means we can leave all five cards to split and she was the one who dropped a bill on our table. ( we assumed that she knows about the total. ) she just did not like to split five cards and mentioned it to us to do less work. \n\nSo, I know it was really mean to do it ( we know this is very annoying when servers get more than 3 cards to split ) but we left five cards on a bill, but while she was working on our bill, my friend said that she is keep staring at us. ( i was sitting toward windows so i actually couldnt see that ) \n\nI normally leave 20-30% tip whenever i get enough service and qualified food, but i told my friends to leave 0 tip and i left 0 tip too. \n\nAs soon as, we left restaurant the other waitress came to us and asked \"something wrong with service?\" \nI replied \"i didnt like the service\" \nI expected her to ask \"such as??\" or what did you guys dislike about ? \n\nBUT she said \"ok bye\" and went back to the restaurant. \n\nOk bye bye. I never gonna recommend this restaurant for my life and also my friends will not. \nI will definitely gonna tell anybody who wants to visit here that this restaurant has the poorest service. \n\nYOU waitress ! (I know one day you will read this and remind about us ) \nI also work as a server in japanese restaurant and sometimes you can not provide service to cusotmers as normal. But shaking head in front of customers while you saw 5 cards stacked on a bill??  and staring at customers while spliting five bills?? Really?? \n\nFuture customers, this restaurant has really good food with reasonable price, but sometimes you wont treated as customer. So careful."

I'll start with the little frustrations to get them out of the way.\n     The parking lot for the group of shops it's in is woefully undersized. You may have a hard time finding a spot right there. Next, there may be a bit of a wait. We went on a Monday with maybe a 20 minute wait, but I've heard from others it can get to be pretty long. Well... That's about it.\n     So the menu is small, but has the essentials. For three of us, we decided to have ramen, then split some extras. The pork belly rice bowl was great as were the gyoza. Everything we ordered was simple, but tasted great.\n     The ramen came out for the next part of the meal. We all went with the tonkotsu ramen. Limited add-ones included, but it wasn't lacking. The broth was amazingly creamy/milky and rich. The noodles had a great texture. Insanely hot, so many sure not to burn your mouth! I made sure to keep plenty of broth left for kaedama (extra serving of noodles).\n     Prices were super-affordable. If you stick with just ramen it's a steal. Even with extras you won't break the bank."

My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner around 6:00 PM on a Monday and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. The restaurant has about four tables, three tables seat four people each and one table seats six people, and then there is bar seating. As we were leaving the restaurant a little before 7:00 PM, I noticed that there were several people waiting outside for a table.\n\nI ordered the Shoyu Ramen, while the boyfriend had the Miso Ramen. Our food came out quickly in 10 minutes or less, much to our delight. We both agreed that my clear Shoyu broth was much better, as the creamy Miso one was a bit salty. Both of our dishes featured their thick and wavy noodles that had a great, chewy texture. The pork chashu is super tender and melts right in your mouth *drool*. If you are a meat lover, you may want to add extra chashu (four pieces) since the ramen only comes with two pieces. The fatty part of the pieces of meat is what packs such flavor and gets you hooked. I added corn and a soft flavored egg as extra toppings to my bowl. The bamboo and black jelly ear mushrooms that come with all ramen dishes made each bite unique and delicious. The Gyoza dumplings were just alright - I probably wouldn't order them again. \n\nI will definitely visit Monta Ramen again the next time I am in Vegas!"

The ponzu sauce for the cold noodle was very citrus and just right. I'm wondering if they are making the homemade ponzu at their place instead of using the sauce from the bottle :) The hint of sesame oil was really blended into the dish and I was happy with the amount of the vegetables that they served with the noodle. \n\nThe chashu is a popular topping for the ramen, but I wanted to try with my rice this time. The chashu bowl comes with several piece of fried pork, chopped dried seaweed, and chopped green onion on top of rice. It was sooooo good!  I think I am sometimes very superstitions. Whenever I eat rice, I gobbled every grain in my bowl . My mom taught me to finish all the rice and eventually it will bring a good luck?! I still feel like that little girl :) Anyways, the dish was so tasty that I finished it all. \n\nThe server always welcoms customers with big smile :p  By the way, I happened to see the owner of Sushi Mon who was helping the kitchen staffs that day..,and the waitress said it's own by him.. What a great success! :-p"

There are 2 servers that seem to consistently let me down, where as the other 2 are always great and work together well to make sure they always check up on us.\n\nThe Chasu (bbq pork) here is quite good, IMO it is better than the chasu at the well known Daikokuya in Los Angeles. Oddly, they have 2 different types of ramen noodles here that are ASSIGNED to the type of broth you choose and they will NOT let you choose the other noodles with a different broth. I prefer the noodles they use in the miso ramen, but normally prefer a combination of tonkatsu and shoyu broth. The lack of flexibility is a bit upsetting and leaves the foodie in me yearning for food MY WAY. \n\nFortunately, I tried all of their fried rices and rice bowls and have been pretty happy with all of them. My favorite is the pork belly bowl. YUM!!! I add a bit of the crushed garlic, chili oil, and japanese chili flakes to make it absolutely scrumptious. If you like pork (who doesn't), you MUST try this."

We got there early, and just in the nick of time, because 10 mins. later the place was packed with people waiting in line.  Husband and I ordered and it took a much longer time to prepare than should have been for the type of food we had.  I had Tonkatsu ramen with extra chasu (bad move) green onions and corn.  The green onions were finely shredded and placed on top like a haystack, and the corn just piled on top.  The chasu was thin and soft and fell apart when picked up.  The broth did not have much flavor.\n\nI couldn't understand why this place did such a wonderful business when right across the street at Hue Thai you can get a wonderful bowl of pho for the same price, and don't have to pay for any extras.  They also have bahn mi (sandwiches) for which they bake their own wonderful bread.  \n\nSkip Monta Noodles and get your noodles at Hue Thai!

Located in a nondescript shopping centre (Seoul Plaza), Monta offers the best Japanese ramen Las Vegas has to offer.  Don't let the drab plaza deter you, this place will knock your socks off!  Upon entering, you will notice that seating is at a premium so arrive early because this place will fill up quickly during the lunch/dinner rush, otherwise you have to write your name on a clipboard and they will call you once seating is available.  I recommend sitting at the bar for two reasons: you get to watch the staff make the ramen in front of you and also the bar \"table\" is made of solid wood and adds to the ambiance.  I highly recommend ordering the Shoyu-Tonkotsu ramen, which is a melding of pork broth and soya based broth, thus creating a perfect balance of saltiness and savory-ness.  (is that even a real word? :p).  If there ever was such a thing as orgasm in pork form, their Chashu pork would be it.  Their Chashu pork is so tender and delicate it literally melts in your mouth.  Add in Nitamago (marinated hard boiled eggs) and you got yourself a bowl of awesome!  All of this for less than $8.00 a bowl, what's not to love?

We had the shoyu (chicken based) ramen with thicker noodles and the shoyu tonkatsu (blend of the shoyu chicken broth and the creamy pork tonkatsu broth). We didn't add extra toppings, and while they might have been nice, they were unnecessary. But bowls were brought quickly and consumed in near silence. The food was so good angels might have passed over our table. I loved the chewiness of the thicker noodles, but my lunch companion thought his thinner noodles were also good, though less chewy and not of a traditional soup noodle than the chewy egg based and thicker ramen noodles that I love. The waitress even checked in to see how our food was. Great service. I have nothing bad to say about this place. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I will make an effort to stop by this restaurant."

This is a place that really does live up to the hype. \n\nMy coworker tried the gyoza and a pork belly bowl and was very pleased with both. I stuck with the tonkatsu ramen ($6.95) with extra pork added ($2.50). The broth was silky, creamy, and perfect! Pho broth seems so blah after eating this. The 6 slices of pork in my bowl were just fatty enough and so delicious! \n\nA pleasant surprise was canned, cold oolong tea for $1.75. It was delicious and really hit the spot. When you're eating soup in 105 degree weather, a cold drink seems more appropriate than hot tea. \n\nService was friendly and accomodating and the broth can't be beat ! I'll be back - but next time I'll be going noodle-less. The noodles are a waste of space ! More yummy broth and meat please."

The noodles had great consistency and the soup was spot on.\n\n+Their 6 piece gyoza tasted like legit ramen shop gyozas. Yum!\n\n\n-Limited seatings. There are four desks that seats four people, one desk that seats two people, and 9 seats available at the counter.\n\n-Line forms even before opening! My boyfriend and I got to Monta a little too early around 11AM. We were waiting in the car and people started trickling in around 11:15AM and there was mini line formed already before opening! Since it's limited seating, the people in line will fill up the restaurant and there will be constant flow of customers/wait time during lunch peak hours.\n\n-I read someone's review that they had great fried rice so I ordered it but it was a-okay. I've had better ramen shop fried rice before so I will not order it again if I visit Monta.\n\nMonta needs to definitely open a shop in LA. Cannot wait to eat Monta until my next visit to Vegas!"

When my friends and I got here the line was out the door. 6 groups of 4 ahead of us and a full house cramped with people. The only reason we stayed and waited was because my friends were really craving ramen. If you really want Monta Ramen, try the location on Eastern and Serene (Next to EOS). That place isn't as busy as this one!\n\nThe ramen was good, portion was generous which is why I'm even giving this place 2 stars. I also ordered gyoza and it tasted like it was the frozen kind you buy from the store. I suspected that because it was still cold in the middle and because they were all stuck together. Im guessing they half assed cooking it because it was busy. \n\nTheir condiments on their table (soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, gyoza sauce) weren't labeled and when my friend picked up the vinegar, the lid opened and spilled it all over the table. It seemed full so I'm guessing whoever refilled it didn't close the lid properly. \n\nLastly, I felt rushed. I couldn't enjoy my food because I felt like the servers where just walking robots trying to get everyone in and out. \n\nBecause of all these things, I probably won't come to this location again especially if there's another location more convenient and less hectic."

When you enter you instantly smell the delicious broth. We were welcomed and seated instantly. When we looked at the menu I was surprised to see that the\nMenu was small! It only had about 4 entrees and half Of them were ramen with the other half side dishes so instantly I knew that this place was going to be delicious since they only specialized on one type of dish! i got the miso ramen while my fianc\u00e9 got the tonkatsu (did I spell that right? Lol) ramen. Both were delicious it's ridiculous how much flavor the broth had! Hands down the best ramen place that I have tried so far! \n\nAs for service I have no complaints either everyone was friendly and greeted us when we entered and when we left!

Due to all of your rave reviews I was compelled to give this place a try.  (I can just hear my dad saying, \"if everyone jumped off a cliff would you jump too?  If it were into a yummy ocean of noodle soup, hell yeah!)\n\nThis little gem is hidden a bit back from the road and does not have a huge eye catching front.  It modestly blends in with the rest of the shops.  As you enter you will be greeted by the cooks, servers, and maybe a few customers.  It is a simple small noodle shop fighting the Vegas Heat with a weak AC system and a multitude of fans.  Was it warm?  Yes sir, very much so.  But my good friend told me, that regardless of the heat we should endure and it would be worth it.\n\nWe sat at the rotating wooden stools at a lovely solid one piece of wood bar.  Service was immediate and friendly.  I found the very short menu to be a relief from the pages and pages of food offerings of other establishments.  I often have trouble deciding what to eat, and then leave with regrets if I did not enjoy my meal.  Neither would be the case today.  I have heard a hero of mine speak of restaurants that only make one thing, but they make it better than anyone else around.  I hoped for a similar experience.\n\nI quickly decided on the Tonkotsu Ramen with tamago, chashu, mustard cabbage, and green onions.  I noticed from everyone's pictures that many of us decided on the exact same combination.  Great minds think alike right?  \n\nA few minutes later a large hot bowl of aroma and color found its way to me.  I dug in and didn't stop till the bowl was tilting to my face and the last drops of soup were tickling my tongue.  I love the thinner noodles over udon, so I am a bit biased here.  The noodles where not over cooked for my taste and the broth had great flavor.  The Chashu I got was soft and delicious.  Everything just seemed to go together perfectly.\n\nIf I were judging this restaurant against all noodle places in vegas, 5 stars.  But since I have had some outstanding noodles in California that I set my standards by, I'll give this 4.  Don't get me wrong, this place is great, and I will be back, but I am saving the 5 star rating for a place I love in California.  I just need to eat there a few more times and make sure that it wasn't just the one time."

I definitely prefer the tonkotsu ramen. So much more flavor!!! Kaedama is a plus. Service - \nOnce you are seated, they get you in and out pretty quickly. They are really good about filling your water glass, I've noticed a lot of ramen places tend to forget about the water.\nAmbiance-\nSmall with very little tables. The counter space tends to have quicker turn around so if you are going there solo or as a couple you will get seated a lot quicker. \nOther- \nParking is easy and this lot has quite a bit of restaurants. While waiting for your table, walk about the area and plan your next meal."

I ordered the Miso Ramen with egg and extra chashu. We also got a side of Gyoza and I tried the mini \"Mentaiko\"(Fish Eggs over rice with nori and sesame seeds\n\nThe Mentaiko was simple and good with a slight heat at the end, the gyoza was okay. Both the miso and Tonkotsu ramen were also good but\nthese guys are pretty slick about jacking up the price of your order with the add on toppings just like some pizza joints do.\n\nMonta is pretty decent but its nothing like spots in Cali or Back home in Hawaii.....Makes me miss Shiro's and Ezogiku even more...ALOHA!!!"

He claimed it was the best he ever tasted .....and I have to admit...it was all that and then some tall dark and handsome (tribe called quest reference) hehe jk anyway \n\n\"The Venue aka the Vibe\"- Clean, Quaint, Accessible, to small groups...I dig the get in the face of my food and \"don't bother me while i'm eating\" environment! usually when you go to a huge spot with a gang of loud mouf mofos its hard to enjoy your food! but then again Japanese are loud period. \n\n\"The Service\"- The server made everything pleasant by being informative about the menu not great but not anything to complain about. Plus we got our food pretty quick. Considering this was officially our first real meal from our 4-5 hour trip this was a huuuuuuuge plus!\n\n\"The Food\"- I ordered the Tonkatus Shoyu Ramen...with extra chashu and extra flavored egg. It was definitely flavorful the broth was amazing and the noodles were soft and easy to gobble up !!!!! I was very tempted to order some more noodles but amazingly I got full pretty quick! I 've had pretty good ramen all over from Torrance to Honolulu and I must say this ranks up there....Maybe because Vegas is considered the 9th island...the local Japanese Hawaiians get it right everytime. \n\nIf you're from the South Bay like I am its pretty comparable to Yamadaya and Hakata...but overall still is another one of those I would come back to Vegas to make this a first pit stop for some bomb ass Ramen yo!"

Although I haven't had the opportunity to eat authentic Japanese food in the land ot the rising sun, the food that is served at Monta is nonetheless delicious. If you had food in Japan and expect this place to be 100% authentic then you may be dissapointed. But if you eat it for what it is then I can promise you that you will not be dissappointed.\n\nIt's like when you have expectations before you watch a movie at the theatre, then you will most likely be let down. But if you watch it for what it is then you will enjoy it, unless the movie completey sucks.\n\nI had the \"Shoyu Ramen\" with extra noodles, and the additions of the egg and pork. The broth was rich with lots of flavor, but the best part was the pork. It was so succulent and flavorful. I recommend adding the chili powder and the sesame seeds to your soup for even more flavor.\n\nService was great and the food is served quickly. Only downside is the price, since all toppings for the ramen are extra charge, so by the time you add on 1-3 toppings you're looking at an average price of about $13 for a bowl. The restaurant is also very small, so prepare to wait for a while if the they're busy, which is most of the time.\n\nIf you love ramen, authentic or not, definitely check this place out, it'll be worth your time.\n\nMonta Noodle House is so great I vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it. Never going to say good bye and never going to tell a lie..."

Growing up in Japan, ramen has been the comfort food for me whenever I'm out and about with family, friends, or by myself. I only knew of 2 other locations here in Vegas when I used to live here and since I left and came back, this popped out of nowhere and it blew me away. Their ramen is perfect. From the texture of the noodles, the amount they serve and the flavor of the broth, it's just perfect. It's also the first time I've been to a ramen shop where you can choose exactly what type of toppings you want. I chose eggs, nori, and pork. The pork and the egg definitely is the perfect toppings I've ever tasted on ramen. The amount of fat and the flavor of the pork was magnificent. The egg was just perfect where the yolk had a creamy texture in the center and the whites had a slight salty flavor to it that just blew me away and mixed very well with the broth (I had the Tonkatsu broth). As for the restaurant itself, It's clean inside. It has a mom and pop feel so it didn't feel fully sterile like an apple store would which I don't mind. It felt very home-e. I felt like I was really in Japan, minus the radio blasting in the background. I think I heard One Direction and some other pop music play. It shouldn't bother you though if you love/hate it because trust me, the ramen will be so good you're not gonna care. Customer service was really fast. I walked in and was greeted and seated right away. I ordered and I'd say 3 or 4 minutes later, I get my bowl. Once I finished my water, (BAM!) refilled. Portions I'd say is just right. They give you enough where you don't end up wasting anything, but I'm just so used to getting gigantic bowls of ramen that I was actually bummed how perfectly proportioned it was! Is that weird? Over all, I give this place a 5 out of 5, I can't wait to eat here again (for ramen that is). I haven't tried the others stuff they offer on the menu, but if ramen is what you're looking for, then look no farther. This. Is. THE. Place. \n\nLocation: 4/5\nCleanliness: 4/5\nCustomer Service: 5/5\nTime: 5/5\nPortions: 4/5\nTaste: 5/5\n27/30 =90%"

The wait wasn't quit as long as she thought it would be because we beat the lunchtime rush so we were seated within a few minutes. \n\nI got their new spicy Ramen and my girlfriend ordered the regular tonkatsu Ramen, we also ordered a side of the menchenko eggs with rice. The quality of noodle is good, very thin and soft and the broth is like buttery, not to salty, not to oily and so smooth and soothing. I think the broth is what makes a good quality Ramen. The price is also just right because for all 3 items I paid about $20 not including tip. Workers are very sweet and the food comes out quick...Be sure to go early because as we were eating and it got more towards lunch time, the line started forming.\n\nI was raving about this place so much to my boyfriend who didn't come with us because he was sleeping back in the hotel room, so suxx for him.

I ask the other waitress and in a few minutes she brought me the correct order, but mentioned what seemed obvious to me that it would be the same price with or without noodles. \n\nThe tonkatsu broth was rich in texture and deep with flavor and shows quality, time, and care in preparation. I loved it.  However, in comparison to Sora, I like Sora's broth just slightly better maybe because it was just a touch lighter in texture and flavor. Monta's didn't put nearly the amount of pork that Sora does. I do sample the noodles and I prefer Sora's noodles; they are sort of springy and light, Monta's were a little heavier.

            "review": "According to Yelp, Monta appears to be the most popular ramen joint in Vegas. If this place were relocated to Little Tokyo in DTLA, Sawtelle Blvd. or Gardena/Torrance, I doubt it would even make the mid-tier.\n\nHits:\n* Mildly impressed by the Tonkotsu ramen -- the broth was greasy and creamy, but not completely full-bodied... definitely not worth the half hour wait and hype\n* Ramen is cheap (~$7), since the portion sizes are small -- if you're still craving more noodles, add another serving for $1.50\n* Order the overpriced hot green tea ($3) and you'll be amazed that the aluminum can is still hot... Apparently the Japanese vending machine keeps the can warm\n* The servers are good about splitting the check, and you can pay with card\n\nLessons Learned:\n* Why are all ramen restaurants so tiny?? This place can seat 20 at a time, and does not easily accommodate to parties larger than 4 (my party of 6 barely fit at the bar counter)\n* Prepare to wait -- we waited half an hour coming here at 5p on a Monday night\n* While the waitress was nice, she seemed really distracted -- In between taking my friend's order, she rushed into the kitchen and then came back 5 minutes later to resume taking down his order... weird\n* The ajitama ($1 for half an egg -.-) is not included and was slightly overcooked.. lame!\n* I think there was one Japanese chef in the show kitchen -- the rest were Latino/a ... reminded me of Tatsu Ramen\n\nI think I'll stick to pho when I'm in Vegas from now on."

I am already dreaming of that tasty broth again!!  I ordered the Shoyu ramen and added an egg (and no pork).  Although at first it seemed like it might be a little basic and not enough, when I received my bowl it was more food than I thought it would be.  The noodles tasted great and the egg was cooked perfectly, not too runny which I don't care for.  The broth was the best, there's something about it that has left me with a craving for it.  Just one bowl left me completely full and satisfied and all for about $8.00!  I must mention that I had gone to an expensive strip restaurant the night before and spent about 15-times that and was so unsatisfied with my food.  The price here for delicious food cannot be beat!  Also worth noting - we arrived exactly at 5pm and there were only 2 parties in front of us.  But within 5-7 minutes of arriving, there was a huge line after us.  The place is small so you might have a wait."

Winter weather = ramen weather! Definitely slurping it up and making my rounds this season, and Monta was one of these. Lol, guess who's clearly late on the ramen train!\n\nParking is packed. Place is tiny. Sign yourself in and be prepared to wait. Make sure that your whole party is present, or they won't seat you. It happened to us. Makes sense though when your establishment is only about five tables and a limited bar area.\n\nI had the shoyu ramen with nori (seaweed) added...I don't have any proper adjectives to describe it for you since I am nothing but a ramen amateur, but it was good. I do know I like thick noodles in my soup and it had that. My boyfriend had the miso and it was creamier compared to mine. We both shared the regular fried rice, which was a nice contrast. I drank their green tea, iced, and it came in a can. My other friend wanted hot tea, and it too, came in the same can, but heated. Strange. Overall, good ramen!"

We arrived at 11:32am on a Saturday as a party of 5 and were the first guests and thought \"Hey, that was easy! Maybe this place doesn't get that busy for Saturday lunch?\"  Suddenly, over the next 5 minutes, several other parties of 2 or 3 people came in one right after another and the place was suddenly full!  If you arrived at 11:40am, you were then looking at a wait of 30-45 minutes until the initial parties were served, ate and left.  So go early!\n\nThe ramen was good.  I do wish they would give you more than 2 thin slices of roasted pork.  I don't know that I'd go again if the wait was over 15 minutes though.  (I actually really like the ramen at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's where you can request all you want roasted pork (since it's a buffet!).

It's tucked into the back of a small shopping center off the North side of Spring Mountain. Signage is minimal which means if you're not paying attention you will miss it.  \n\nParking: Limited parking spaces if other businesses nearby are open. Can be tight to park if crowded. \n\nMonta is small. Square footage wise they've taken a small space and maximized every square foot of it. Don't be surprised if there's a wait that you have to stand outside as there's room for maybe 2-3 people inside the front door. \n\nSeating. They have a handful of tables and a counter with slightly uncomfortable stools you can sit on that looks into a fun to watch kitchen. If you are shy, claustrophobic, or don't like slurping noodles where anyone can watch this is not the place for you. \n\nFood: I walked in here skeptical. 559 Yelp reviews. Lots of heated discussions, controversy abounds about Monta. I came to try it, and I came in a bad mood to boot. I ordered Miso Ramen with extra slices of charziu. And I had an OMG moment here that left me with a smile from ear to ear and I left the bowl totally empty. I will say that Ramen Sora has better charziu, hands down. But the overall experience I had at Monta was superior in every other aspect.  \n\nSpecial Notes: Monta's Miso Ramen has a bit more oil in the broth. It's not an oil that ruins the taste, it seems to enhance it somewhat. But it's also a small problem if you're sitting at the counter slurping a bowl of ramen and you get some splash back that lands on your shirt. If you've got to go back to work after eating at the counter, having some Shout wipes on hand is essential. \n\nOverall Impression? I loved it. From the wide range of people I ate lunch beside to the overall awesomeness of the Miso Ramen to the friendly and fast staff, count me among those who understand why Monta inspires such a range of emotion. For me, this was an experience I won't soon forget, and I can't wait to go back and have more of it."

I scoffed at the notion of a good Ramen joint existing in Vegas. I crave for good Ramen, and so far the best I've had to date was from Santouka Ramen in LA. The Ramen joints in The City are a joke, but thank god for San Mateo as my only salvation for good Ramen. \n\nSo when Wifey found this place, I was very skeptical; but I had no choice since she won all the money in Vegas that pretty much paid for our trip and then some. \n\nSo we drove to Vegas' Chinatown district and one thing I noticed is that the blocks are like a frigging mile long. Damn...the blocks are so far apart I felt like I was in the desert. \n\nSo we arrived and it's in a small strip mall similar to those found all over California (looks promising) and definitely qualifies as a Hole-In-The-Wall joint. The place is small...more tiny than small with a seating of about 20 + at a time. It was around lunch and the place was packed. I also observed a squad car illegally parked and had me worried for a second thinking it was a crime-ridden area and had an incident in progress. My guard subsided when I saw two of Vegas' finest slurping the Ramen inside. \n\nWe waited for approximately 20-25 minutes before we got called and I was famished. I was already eyeing the 'Daily Special\" board of Kuro Ramen and Spicy Tonkutso Ramen (both $7.95). Sold! Wifey also ordered a side of Tonkutso Pork over a bowl of rice. \n\nThe side order arrived first and what we got was a pile of pork meat on top of rice topped with Nori strips. Ummmm....Anthony Bourdain would approve of this. \n\nThen our Ramen arrived and all my skepticism disappeared and what I felt next was envy. I was envious that Vegas can have a better Ramen joint than San Francisco. Then envy turned into sadness, which turned into me slurping the noodles to comfort my emotional needs at that time. \n\nThe broth was amazing. Unlike the broths in The City that are overly salty, this one was creamy, thick, rich but also tasted light. How could that be? It wasn't rich, thick and heavy as one would expect. All I can say is wow. It truly made a believer out of me. I also tasted the Wifey's broth and the roller coaster of emotion began again. \n\nThis one really surprised me in a good way."

The broth is savory and the Gyoza is delightfully crispy!  The noodles are cooked to the perfect chewiness.\n\nMonta is extremely small, so do not bring anymore than four people here.  If you're lucky, you'll get a table, but most of the time, you end up sitting at the counter (which is still cool because then you get to watch the chefs cook the noodles).  \n\nThe food is yummy and the price tag is inexpensive = VALUE GALORE... Oh, and the service is always amazing.  The only catch? - Bring cash, because they don't take credit cards for bills under $10.00.  \n\nGo here. Just... Go.  I promise you will not regret it.

I did enjoy the pork belly over rice, the pork was well seasoned, but next time I would order the smaller size because the regular had a lot of rice. \n\nDon't be fooled by the small size of this restaurant,   The service is fast and the wait is worth it!

A process to make all bowls of an order. A process to continue the broth and insure each bowl is consistent irregardless of when made. Chef tasted the broths as being made so nothing would be off. Chef insured all ramen noodles were consisted from each bowl. \n\nMy order was the Tonkotsu shoyo ramen garlic pork added egg. Others in my group ordered the black ramen and one substituted their protein for chicken. The order didn't take long for the ramen master to artfully prepare and have wait staff deliver. The broth was made from pork or chicken.\n\nThe dishes arrived with the noodles, protein, broth, spices, vegetables, and spoons all fashionably placed in the bowl. With those who added egg, the egg was sitting on top. Tender noodles through. Broth was well layered and spicy in it's own. I still added some because I love the kick. Cha shu was not overly fatty.

The broth was very good, not too greasy or salty, but a great combination of pork flavors. The noodles were also well cooked, not too soft or al dente. Then comes the best part, the large pork pieces that are placed in the ramen. They are thinly sliced with a portion of fat that just makes it taste so good. I always want more, and often do order extra pork for my ramen, since they usually only give you about 2-3 pieces and after you have them, you want more. The ramen also comes with some other ingredients and if you start adding some extra ingredients, the cost of your bowl of ramen will add up (including a soft-boiled egg, extra noodles, some vegetables, and more).

The char-chu bowls are better than those I tried in Japan the pork belly bowls tastes like pork version of Yoshinoya, skip it, too much mirin and sugar.

So for our last meal in Vegas before heading back to LA, I wanted to come here!\n\nWe arrived at 11:40 AM on a Sunday, the place was full and there were 4 groups ahead of us. Monta opens at 11:30!! Insane. We waited about 35-40minutes before getting seated at the counter. \n\nFOOD: Ramen was yum as I remembered! Base price is pretty cheap $6.95 but when you add the egg, it brings it up to a regular bowl of ramen.  I had the tonkotsu ramen (my fave) Really rich and good flavor with a PERFECT soft boiled egg! Chasiu was also super tender and falling apart. HUGE portions!! I didn't finish my noodles :( \n\nVENUE: Small, as usual and single unisex bathroom. Very cute and clean and I loved watching the chefs make the food.\n\nSERVICE: Quick!! Food came out super fast after we ordered and they were always friendly and easy to flag down.\n\nPARKING: Plenty!"

There is a sign in system so be sure to get your name and number in your party written down on the clipboard by the hostess podium. They will call your name out when there's a table ready. \n\nThe place is TINY! Maybe 8 bar stools by the ramen bar, and 10 tables. \n\nThey blast top 40 which creates an odd ambiance, the waitresses are hurried and harried. Case in point: we tried to place our orders when the waitress brought us our water to which point she said she couldn't take our orders right now. She appears when she's ready to take our orders and when we ordered the gyoza appetizer, she screams it to the kitchen. She wrote down the rest of our ramen orders.\n\nWe ordered the Tonkatsu and Miso ramen. I made mine spicy ($1 extra). The Tonkatsu is pork broth based, while the Miso was pork and chicken soup base. They were both flavorful and contained green onions, roughly two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. I say roughly because the chashu were very thin and mostly fat, therefore dissolving in our ramen. The spicy I added to my ramen was not mixed into the broth, instead it was a goop that sat on top of the ramen along with my toppings. It tasted like the Korean Gochujang chili pastes, and did not compliment the flavor of the ramen. \n\nThere were no service on the remainder of our dining experience, I'm not sure if this is because it's more of a casual counter service/semi-table service. \n\nIf you've ever had Santouka Ramen in Arlington Heights or any where else, I do believe they are the superior ramen shop.\n\nAll in all it was $25 with tip, so not bad for the experience."

With the wait however, it just is not worth it suddenly. Especially because I am from Southern California, there are a lot more ramen places that is just as good, if not better, than Monta Ramen. But for the Las Vegas area, this has been the best place to get my ramen fix. \n\nThe broth is super fresh and clean, not filled with like oils and things like that. The meat is super soft, which just melts in your mouth. The noodles are just how I like them, RAMEN noodles. \n\nOne bowl is enough to satisfy your hunger. \n\nNow to mention the wait - my family and I waited 50 minutes for ramen noodles. Factoring that in, it was not worth it. The waitress even let back people who \"left\" from the waiting list, and came back! That's not what a waiting list does, if a party leaves, they are off the list. The waitress would squeeze the party back in. That just lengthens the time I am waiting outside, especially since she did it for two 5 person parties before mine. \n\nThey have another Monta in Vegas now. Maybe that one is worth trying out."

Blew away Menya Kissou in Tokyo, my previous fav.  Melts in your mouth.\n\nThe nita tamago wasn't that good.  Passed on it the second time.

My family of 4 came right at the peak of dinner 7pm and only had to wait for 20 minutes, not too bad if you ask me.\n\nWe started our meal off with a pork belly bowl which was just savory goodness. The pork drippings from the fat coated the each grain of rice and made it all savory, buttery, and utterly delicious. The slivers of red ginger also helped to cut the fattiness/greasy factor of this dish.\n\nNext came our orders. We each ordered some variety of ramen, but noticed that only the miso ramen came with \"traditional\" ramen noodles. Everyone else received these thinner noodles...still good, but not what we expected. I added a pad of butter and corn to my dish which made it more complete in my opinion....I also appreciated the fact that add-on's here ranged from $0.50 to $1.50 as opposed to my regular $1.50 to $3.00 in the Bay Area (for the same two spoonfuls of corn in most cases).

This is definitely one of those places where you would have to hear about.  One of those hole in the wall places.\n\nOnce you walk in you are greeted warmly by the staff and the cozy environment.  You can see the kitchen and the workers all hard at work trying to fill the mouths of its many customers.  One thing I have to say about this place, and I have eaten here many times, prepare to wait a bit for there is usually a line because of how delicious this place is.\n\nOnce seated there will be a small menu with now four types of ramen you can choose from.  A tonkotsu base ramen which is pork based, shoyu which is soy based, tonkotsu-shoyu which is a mix of the two, and miso which is bean paste based.  They also have side items which you can put into your ramen like corn and eggs which are a pretty much a must.  The portions are also very generous and you will get that good fill feeling.\n\nI have personally eaten them all and can vouch for them all.  They are all so good.  Monta is like the In-N-Out of ramen.  They specialize in ramen and boy, do they deliver.  This is now one of the only ramen places I will go to eat.

I'm not sure if we just came in on a bad day, but I thought the noodles were too hard and the broth didn't have much flavor at all. Also thought the Chasu was weird. It was easy to eat because it was sliced very thin, but I did not like that slimy ring of fat around it. My husband felt the same way about his Tonkatsu Ramen. \n\nService was not the best either. The employees were slow with drink refills and they seemed to be more attentive to the larger parties in the restaurant. We waited a long time for our bill after eating.\n\nSorry, but this place just does not live up to all the hype. I would prefer having ramen across the street at Shuseki."

Thanks to my girlfriend taking her friend out for her birthday I got to try Monta. This place is busy literally all day from what I hear. When we arrived for dinner it was no different. People are taking cabs to this place from the strip since they heard good thing's about it.\n\nTonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen is what I went with. It's a blend of pork and chicken broth. Basic toppings are green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Of course me being super hungry I got extra pork, Nitamago(seasoned hard boiled egg) and extra noodles. So fresh and super good. We also got Gyoza (Handmade pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings). They were flavorful.\n\nThis place is not super big but the food is worth the wait to get a table. 4 stars. I see more ramen in my future."

Once you get a seat and order your Tonkatsu ramen, you can get ready for a savoy meal that you can remember for a very long time.  The fried rice that we ordered came first and it had the most pleasant taste ever.  For a ramen place, their fried rice was beyond exceptional.  The texture of the rice was just perfection to the tongue, sauteed to a heavenly standard.  The taste just melting into your taste palette is nothing less then the gold standard.  Once the ramen arrived,  the smell of the broth elicited a mouth watering sensation.  The delicate slices of Tonkatsu just melting into your tongue once you start to chew it in your mouth.  The broth was also truly rare and exceptional.  This is definitely a experience worth the wait.  :)"

It was way past normal dinner time but there was still a line to get in.  It took 40 minutes before we got our table.  There was a dust storm that evening so waiting outside was pretty special.  \n   The inside is small and not very impressive and gives you the feel of eat and get out soon as possible.   The service was pretty good despite being busy.  We ordered our ramen and a pork belly bowl.  The pork belly bowl with rice was pretty good.  The marinated Tender and tasty marinated pork was a hit with all of us.  \n   The Ramen arrived and I got the Spicy Tonkotsu which when I mixed in the red spicy paste  made the broth nice and thick.  I really enjoyed the taste and devoured my ramen as if my life depended on it.  The broth had a great taste and the added on egg made it even better.  The daughter got the black garlic ramen which I didn't care for.  So the Spicy Tonkotsu is my recommendation as I am craving it as I write this review.  I do think my next visit will be to pick up as the wait can be crazy at times."

In my love-hate relationship with Vegas, things like this definitely belonged to the first category.  \n\nTwo groups of very jovial Japanese business men occupied the cozy joint when we walked in.  They seemed right at home, joyfully exchanging conversations from across the restaurants to each other as well as the waitresses.  From the smiling eyes to the careless laughter, I make the speculation that they were tourists happy to have found Monta.  I've been there, that rare delight from finding a great Vietnamese restaurant somewhere completely unexpected.  \n\nIt was a frigid night.  Lips cracked from the desert air, my mouth greedily welcomed the steaming broth of the Tonkatsu Ramen, rich with pork bone flavor and complimented with smooth strings of fresh noodles.  Had it been warmer weather, I'd have opted for the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen, a bit lighter with the mix-in of chicken-flavored Shoyu broth.  \n\nI could do without the pricey upsell of add-ons, but I still highly recommend them, especially the soft-boiled egg, corn, and seaweed.  You may end up spending nearly 10 bucks on ramen, but it's still a better choice than anything at Grand Lux"

I've had ramen in LA (which is much better back home, and I'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something I can compare to), and the food here is a decent.  \n\nTonkotsu Ramen $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-The broth is pretty good.  It comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  The pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  \n\nMy gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  I mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  It's almost required!!!  I also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  Part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  The egg I got was slightly hard when I got it.\n\nPork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - Average.  The pork belly is extremely sweet!  I think they use too much sauce or something. The sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  I'd pass on this next time.\n\nI was able to try my friends Takana fried rice and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.\n\nTips:\n-Not good for groups.  Restaurant is small, maybe seats 20 people inside.   Parties of 4 or larger might have trouble sitting.\n-Egg isn't complimentary w/ the ramen, so you gotta spend $2 extra =(\n-No garlic press available"

It was this past Saturday night and I actually expected to have to wait after reading the other reviews. My advice to anyone going when they're busy is to watch the list!! My party of 4 waited outside for about 40 minutes. After noticing people being seated that arrived after us we decided to go back inside the crowded little waiting area inside to look at the list. Our name was not crossed off but the 6 lines below my name were. Just then we watched as a table of 4 got up to leave and looked for the hostess to call us over. Instead she looked at a young asian man standing directly in front of me, to come over to the table. I said out loud \"Wait we are next on the list!\" It was futile as I was completely ignored. I then grabbed the list and walked over to the server/hostess that seated them and pointed out to her how we were obviously next to be seated since every name above mine was crossed out. She pulled the \"I'm going to act like I don't speak English card\" and mumbled about a mistake. She pointed to another table where the diners were paying their check and said we can sit there. Ugh! If my family wasn't so hungry after waiting for so long I would've walked out at that point. What bothered me the most is the fact that the hostess never even looked at the list before motioning for the other party to be seated. Would I have waited 2 hours to be seated had I not gone inside to inspect the situation? Now for the food...the regular fried rice was not very flavorful but had a nice meat to rice ratio. It was also on the greasy side which I like. The cod fish eggs over rice was not edible. It looked great but tasted really fishy and not fresh. I tried dousing it with chili oil and then soy sauce but nothing could quash the fishy smell. The kuro Ramen with black garlic oil was fantastic and is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. It was very salty, which I love, and had 3-4 pieces of chasu. The broth was the star of the dish. The pork wasn't bad but a little bland, while the noodles and green onions seemed fresh and tasty. My family ordered gyoza, which they warn you will take 10 minutes to cook. I didn't try any, but the kiddos liked it. After our meal it took another 20 minutes to flag down a server to get our check and another 10 to wait for the check to be picked up. I won't be back, needless to say, but will say that the food is way better than the service."

Do you know why it is that the Japanese community in LV has turned their back on MONTA? There are many reasons.....\n\nI was confused. I was really confused. Why was I not a fan of MONTA? Every Chinese person kept telling me that MONTA was \"the best\". Every Korean woman kept telling me that it was \"the best\". Even their white husbands kept telling me that MONTA is \"the best\". My Mexican-American and Black foster kids kept telling me that Monta was \"the best\". Why is it that I didn't like it when everyone around me kept saying that it was the greatest? Am I just not Japanese enough to enjoy MONTA? My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese-American and he did marry a Korean woman, so maybe that Korean blood in me erased my ability to determine what a good ramen is. But then I started noticing that all my friends and business partners who were born and raised in Japan kept insisting that MONTA was NOT \"the best\", In fact they thought it was \"the worst\". So I came to the conclusion that Japanese people just don't like MONTA like everyone else does. \n\nPersonally, I think MONTA is  the California Roll of Ramen. It's a slightly Americanized variation, just like how the California Roll is an Americanized variation of traditional Maki. MONTA's ramen belongs to no true Japanese region.  It's made in America like Burgers and Fries. \n\nNo one eats comfortably at MONTA. The place is extremely cramped, the chairs are very uncomfortable. The counter is made of that cheap plywood you find at discount furniture outlets on Maryland and Flamingo.  The bathroom is like 4 feet from the bar, and some guy always insists on taking a huge dump and leaving the door open. There is never any parking in the lot. Frequently, I just drive across the street to Shuseki(A Chinese-Japanese restaurant) where it's much more comfortable and the ramen is f*cking awesome.  MONTA is the most popular ramen-ya in Vegas, so why won't they move to a larger space? One of the wealthy Korean business owners who is a member of my Asian-American Activism agency informed me that Seoul Plaza(where Monta is located) has the cheapest rent in Chinatown.  The owner of MONTA is attempting to cut costs to maximize profits and that's why he won't leave Seoul Plaza.  Cheapness is the main reason! And Cheapness is also the reason why your bowl of ramen at MONTA is only half the size of the other 4 major Ramen-Ya's in LV. And Cheapness is why you have to pay extra for every little thing. You gotta pay extra for noodles, you gotta pay extra for the egg, you gotta pay extra for butter and corn! How cheap is that!!! If you get all the add ons, the bowl of ramen comes out to like $15.00. You can get the egg, extra charsu, extra noodles, 50% more broth, corn, butter, and garlic oil all included in the $8.00-$9.00 bowl of ramen at Fukumimi. The Deluxe Ramen at Sora also has everything included and it's only like $10.00 flat.\n\nThe f*cking hipsters! This is a major reason why the Japanese have left MONTA.  Hipsters are usually White people, but they think it's cool to hang out in latino areas or Chinatowns. I don't know why, but hipsters think it's \"lame\" being around other Whites. Unfortunately, they have chosen MONTA as their \"COOL MINORITY HANGOUT SPOT!\". As a Japanese-American, do I wanna sit with a bunch of guys with \" David Lynch Eraserhead\" haircuts who wear Geek-Sheek  glasses and talk about their feelings? Do I wanna sit with a 6 foot 4\" man in a dress who is attempting to start a conversation with me about: Indie Rock, Indie Flicks,  Jesus(aka Obama), Apple Products, and how cool it is to wear sunglasses indoors?  My response= THAT'S IT! NO MORE!  I'M F*CKING OUT OF HERE! I'M GOING TO FUKUMIMI!\n\nBy the way... How f*cking long does it take for you guys to eat one bowl of ramen? While I'm on the waiting list for over 1 hour, I always notice how people finish their ramen after 15 minutes but just sit there and talk for another 45 minutes. This is the reason why we gotta wait so f*cking long to get a seat. \n\nMONTA has the worst Gyoza in LV. It tastes like the Chinese variation, and they all stick together like they are frozen(look at my pics). And they give you like 5 pieces for $5.00. That's like a dollar a piece!! Walk 2 minutes to Shuseki for a much better gyoza.\n\nWhy did my egg come from the Alley? They ran out of eggs during my last visit and then they ran into the alley and grabbed another box? Are the eggs just sitting out there in some kind of big jar?\n\nA Japanese restaurant is supposed to have Kim-Uchi, not Kimchi. I saw with my own eyes, the cook here at MONTA going to Greenland to buy one of those giant glass jars of Korean Kimchi. At Fukumimi, Katsu-San makes his own Kim-Uchi which is slightly sweeter than Korean Kimchi. It's a true Japanese variation of a classic Korean dish.  \n\n#$@!*$#%$ *%#!

We generally don't sweat the decor, or lack thereof, as long as the food is good.\n\nThey offer shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu ramen and several other items on their menu. We ordered the tonkotsu, of course, which was $7 for a small-medium sized bowl. They used the thin white classic tonkotsu ramen noodles which were decent but lacked the elasticity or chewy \"freshness factor\" of other places we've tried. As my wife will attest to, I like my food salty and flavorful, but their broth was a bit too salty, even for me. It had an earthy shiitake mushroom flavor but was lacking in the porky flavor and richness of a good tonkotsu broth. Neither of us cared to slurp up any of the broth once we were done with the noodles. I found the two pieces of chashu were mediocre at best. They were somewhat tough and fatty and had this unusual ring of gelatin around the edges.\n\nThis place is arguably the best ramen place in Vegas that we have found so far. Unfortunately that also isn't saying very much. A mere year ago, both of us would probably have been more than satisfied with Monta. Damn you Ichiran for making ramen snobs out of us and forever raising our ramen bar! The search continues for better ramen in Vegas..."

Good service, quaint layout, and the price can't be beat.\n\nI'm struggling giving it another star because I noticed somethings in the 20 minutes I was there to make you go hmmmm.  You heard me 20 minutes to get in, order a shoyu ramen and asahi and get out.  Can't beat that for efficiency.\n\nMenu is straight and to the point, if you are not here for Ramen, go somewhere else.  Broths are Tonkatsu, Shoyu, and Miso.  Shoyu is the base for me (kinda like vanilla ice cream).  Soup comes standard with a few thin slices of roast pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, and some seaweed.  The noodles were decent but not homemade, very stock machine made ramen.  I like my ramen al dente, these were not.  I did add the pat of butter for $.50 which was a nice addition, but totally over priced.\n\nSat at the bar so had full view of kitchen and how things were prepared.  Didn't like how the cooks did not sanitize very well, bare hands on food doesn't bother me, but when you grab an egg and some  pork slices, I'd like to see you wash them hands before moving on to the next order.  Also noticed their Kim Chee was out of a bottle, which they could have done a better job at concealing if they kept it towards the back.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice spot to get your ramen on, I would totally suggest going here.  Keep your party to 4 or less otherwise it would be a stretch to find seating for everyone."

Compare this place to Shoku Ramen which is down the street, it is very competitive. Again another ramen house with salty broth. Can I get a normal broth with just bone and vegetable taste then I add my own fish sauce and miso to my liking? The saltiness is still better than Shoku ramen, but then again it might be my bad luck at Shoku Ramen. \n\nMonta Ramen is pretty closed to my house. The combination of garnish, slice of belly pork, and broth is not fully met to the famous tonkotsu. But overall it was good. The service is fast. I get to pick thick or thin noodle. The decoration was earth tone which is easy to the eyes but not vibing like Las Vegas strip interior design. The kitchen is huge compare to the seating space. If they were to do a remodel again, they might want to calculate out the total space and give more space to the seatings. The last time I counted, this has less than 45 seats. I think they can push to the 50-60 if they redo the kitchen. The menu do not have a long list of items. Just broth, noodle pot, fryer and a few pots to boil. How much are storage spaces? I think there is a huge space for storing food to the decade. Not just 6 months supplies. Starbuck have the same total items but look at the reasonable kitchen size."

I have never had creamy broth like what they have, but it will cure a hangover in five minutes flat. The noodles have just the right amount of chew. My fiance fell in love with their pork belly rice and I was lucky enough to receive the bright pink pickled ginger that he didn't want. It was the perfect accompaniment for that ultra-rich broth. And the gyozas are little pockets of steamed/crispy goodness. I just wish I hadn't been so full when I got them. \n\nThe wait can be long, but it is well worth it and your food comes quickly once you are inside. The portions and prices are deceptive and you will end up with way too much food if you aren't careful. Overall, I highly recommend this place and suggest the cab ride if you're visiting on the Strip."

There is a restaurant that specializes in kuro ramen near my own home, but it does not compare to Monta's. \n\nThe food came out pretty fast, which is always awesome. The garlic was incredibly flavorful and aromatic and just amazingly delicious. Chashu was also really nice and tender. My only qualm was that the broth was a little salty for my own liking. I had to add some ginger and sesame seeds to cut the saltiness a bit, but other than that it was very, very good. If I had access to Mona Ramen close to my own home, I would eat there so much it would definitely not be too good for my blood pressure.\n\nCan't wait to come back and try their tonkatsu and miso ramen as well!"

The lines - The place is typical for a Ramen shop, with limited space to eat and to wait, but it is worth it.  My suggestion is to go when it opens and it will be all good.\n\n2.  The food -  Have had:\na.  Miso Ramen - Bean Paste Ramen, very tasty. noodles perfect.\nb.  Shoyu Ramen - Soy Sauce flavored broth and a nice stand by.\nc.  Tonkatsu Ramen - Pork Bone broth - my favorite.\n\nAll noodles are just right, al dente and the broth is not piping hot as I would expect, but tasty overall.  Perhaps they believe the western palate does not prefer the hot broth, but to me, it has to be piping hot to be perfect.  The soups have a perfect blend of roasted pork slices that are tender and tasty.\n\n3.  Price - Very reasonable, approximately 7.00 depending if you put extra stuff in the noodles.\n\nCheck this place out.  you will not be disappointed."

I'm not a ramen expert, but I've had my fair share of ramen throughout LA and OC (though Daikokuya in LA is up there). Everyone has their own style of ramen, coming from different regions in Japan. My favorite just happens to be tonkatsu-style ramen.\n\nAfter waiting about a half hour to get seated in this hole-in-the-wall, we were slurping away. The price of $6.95 per bowl is a steal, but if you want to add extras it can easily go up to $10+. I had the tonkatsu-shoyu, and I found the broth to be perfect. Deep, rich flavor, while not too heavy or salty. \n\nMy particular bowl of ramen came with thin noodles, which were okay. I kept reaching over to steal some of my wife's shoyu bowl, which had the standard, curly-style ramen noodles. Those had a nice, al dente chew, and I just loved how it clinged onto the flavors from the broth. Of course, what did I do after I was finished with my bowl? I had to order an extra side of curly ramen noodles for $1.50. Well worth every penny.\n\nThe other part worth mentioning is the slices of pork in the ramen. I'm used to the thick, fatty slices of pork belly. At Monta, the pork is so thinly sliced that it just melts and falls apart as soon as you try to pick it up with chopsticks. It's a shame that you only get 2 slices with the bowl. Next time around, I'm ordering extra. \n\nI can just imagine my face dripping with sweat if I'm slurping down Monta ramen in 110+ Vegas heat in the summer. I was dripping with sweat in 70 degree winter weather in November! At any rate, it's definitely worth the short drive from the Strip, the sweat, and the wait to eat at Monta ramen."

Let the ramen begin.\n\nI ordered their special- cold noodle with the mushroom, tomatoes, pork. The words 'cold' and 'noodle' shouldn't be in the same sentence, I know...but this is different. It was a refreshing blend of meats and veggies for the hot weather.\nMy cousins ordered the pork belly bowl, which is served with rice. To attempt..to even try to get close on its description..it's like Yoshinoya but 100 times better!\nThe other cousin got the miso based soup with an additional corn. It's so creamy and filled with flavor. \n\nI rarely head to the strip for food, instead take on adventures to find the best Asian places here in the desert. \n\n4 stars for their awesome food. But if I could, I'll give them a 3 for the seating capacity. I just don't like waiting."

Monta is located in the heart of Chinatown on Spring Mountain and although it is a divey, don't let that stop you from eating here. The noodles have great texture and the flavorful broth has lots of hidden flavors that will keep your tongue wanting more.\n\nThis place deserves 5 starts. Unfortunately I had to knock one down because it is a bit divey and cramped inside. Don't get me wrong, this is my kind of place. I'm willing to bump elbows to enjoy some good ramen. And I have to admit that does add to the charm, however, it can be an inconvenience specially during lunch hours. \n\nNevertheless, really enjoyed this place and will become a regular."

I opted to order takeout, so I would get it sooner, and I could use my waiting time to go next door for some milk tea(review for them will be next). They quoted me a 20 minute wait time, which was fine with me. \n\nI went next door, for boba, waited for my milk tea, and hung out outside for maybe two minutes, and he comes outside looking for me, looking worried that I had forgotten about my food or something. \n\nI get home, and am eating my Spicy Tonkatsu while writing this, and it is DELICIOUS.

The place  is reminiscent to the noodle houses we frequent in Torrance, CA and Litte Tokyo, offering a simple menu that doesn't detract patrons from the restaurant's main dish: ramens. We opted to try the miso ramen (bean paste) and tonkotsu ramen (pork bone) with the addition of available toppings such as chasu (roasted pork -- not for the fat conscious eater), shredded green onions, and butter (yes, butter!). The third ramen offering, shoyu, is something we'll probably try on the next go. The noodles were chewy-soft and a bit firm which is how it should be, and with a flavor-rich broth that's a cross between creamy melted butter and meaty-savory -- a feat only possible with many hours of high heat infusion of the ingredients. On a hot summer day, the place suffers from the lack of a good a/c, but once you start chowing down your piping hot ramen, the warm ambience fades into obscurity. A definite must-try place that we're glad we stumbled upon!"

I love the open kitchen layout because it's fun to see the cooks at work making the food and creating the magic.\n\nSo let me back up. This little restaurant is located in a small strip mall off of Spring Mountain (Las Vegas' International District). Use Yelp Directions to help you find it. It's small, clean, and similar to a place you might visit in Tokoyo today (only it's missing the plastic food display at the front of the store). We walked in around 4'ish and the place was already packed.  Luckily, we only had to wait a couple of minutes before a place opened up at the bar.  A very nice server came over and took our orders down on her iPad (good modern touch).  \n\nThe Shoyu Ramen (thick ramen, soy sauce & chicken broth w/ 2 slices of Pork) was only $6.95;  Tonkatsu (thin ramen, pork bone stew w/ 2 slices of Pork and a side of spicy sauce was $7.95; side of Kimchi $1; and rice $1. Oolong tea served nice and hot in a can was only $1.75.  \n\nAny Cons, you may ask? Well the restaurant is really small and really crowded because of it's popularity & tasty Ramen.  You have to eat fast or your Ramen will get cold. Also they want you out of there as quick as possible so they can make room for the poor customers waiting in line.  Think of this as an Express Ramen Noodle shop. We enjoyed this experience and definitely plan to visit again soon."

Bowl size and portion was just perfect but I could've easily ordered another set of ramen because I was that hungry that day but controlled myself. Soup based wise, it was kind of salty. Ramen though was perfect and the mix of chashu and egg was perfect since I usually have these at other ramen restaurants. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a good ramen place while you're in Vegas visiting, Monta Ramen is the place to check out.

My husband got the combination Tonkatsu and Shoya and it was just as yummy as my dish. It is interesting how many variations there are of ramen and how adding one ingredient changes the whole dish. \n\nMonta really is a hole in the wall restaurant because it could easily be missed in the shopping center.

I think it was because this was my first time trying \"authentic\" Japanese ramen, so I wasn't sure what to expect and left feeling unsure. However, our bond has solidified and deepened with each visit, each more yearning and wanting than the last.\n\nTonkotsu-Shoyu ramen is my favorite ramen, and I like to relish it with most of the condiments they offer. The pork belly bowl is both sweet and savory. The gyoza is delicious, the pork inside perfectly cooked and rich. Thankfully they don't mark up their canned drinks too much so a party of 2 could get away with 2 ramen bowls and 2 drinks and the bill will come to $20, not including tip.\n\nIf you come here in the summer months, prepare to deal with stifling heat. Monta is so small and doesn't have the best air conditioning to battle the heat and since the place is packed all the time, it will definitely get stuffy. A bowl of hot ramen is more enticing in the cooler months. But no matter what time you visit, prepare to wait anywhere from 5-30 minutes for seating. Tables are of course preferable since they're more private and have more room, but you'll wait longer for one. The bar is great too.\n\nBe prepared to get \"hurried\" in and out because as soon you're seated, your order will be taken and as soon it looks like you're done with your meal, waitresses will zip over and offer to take your bowl in a hurry to get the waiting guests seated. This isn't an ideal place to take your time chit-chatting with a friend for a long period. It IS a great place to get full on rich ramen and then be on your way to your next outing or errand."

You pick which noodle bowl you want, choose whatever you want to add to it (like a hard boiled egg for example) for an extra charge of course.\n\nThey also have other items like gyoza (pot stickers) and fried rice.\n\nService is above average and it should be because you can only fit so many people in this tiny place.

If you see lots of people outside just standing there, chances are you will be waiting for a bit before getting a table. For those that are chopstick challenged like me, they will not give you a fork unless you ask because you are already given chopsticks by default. All the condiments you need like sesame seeds, soy sauce, etc are right there on your table.\n\nSo you see their operation is simple.

This is my first review as an Elite woohoo! \nMaybe I had higher expectations of this place, even though I had nothing to compare it to other than the ramen you get for .20 at the local grocery store. It was good. Very good even. I ordered the pork/chicken broth ramen add corn and butter. I ate the entire bowl and would order it again. I personally chose to add a little chile oil and whatever that mixed seasoning at the table was. It def improved my broth which needed the extra umph. The pork in the soup was not my style. The fatty skin reminded me of duck, which I don't like the skin of. Everything else in the soup was yummy and ill consider adding extra mushrooms and maybe an egg next time. \nGood prices, I'd much rather go order a $7 bowl of ramen, versus buying all those ingredients and doing it myself. However, how often do I eat ramen is really the question here, maybe that's why I expected it to be something more than basic. Ill consider ramen again, as long as I don't have to wait (which you usually do considering they have like 6 tables) or possibly order it Togo. I did notice that was an option. Next time ill try Sora or Fukumimi."

Located in Las Vegas, over 100* in the summer and serving nothing but boiling soup AND an open kitchen that lets heat from the stove circulate throughout the extremely small dining area...Monta is a great place to dine in the winter, but in the summer, you'd have to eat it with struggle. I'd hate to give it less than 4 stars because of its environment, since the food is delicious, but Monta is one of those places where it's really a diamond in the rough, and it will eventually affect the way you feel about the meal overall.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very tiny. It sits up to around 30 people max and because of its popularity, it is always packed. They have about 10 items on their menu only, with 4-5 of it being their specialty noodles. The broth here is superb, especially their miso flavored ramen. It is very rich and buttery in taste. The soup is not salty at all, and their noodles are extremely fresh and chewable. It is almost uniquely sweet when you bite into them. The char siu pork that comes with the noodles (japanese pork with soy on the outer skin and slow BBQ) is delicious. The meat is thinly sliced and fatty at the same time. When you bite into it, with the combination of the buttery taste of the broth, you will get an almost guilty sensation of rich flavors. It is really worth the experience, if you can deal with the heat. \n\nMonta gives you the option of adding extra items into your ramen, each of it having a charge from like .50 to $3 ... The only thing that is worth the extra charge (since I ordered it all before-- not worth it!) is the boiled egg, butter, and extra char siu. Everything else will just overwhelm your soup and by the time you're done eating half.. the soup will be soggy and floating with stuff in it. \n\nJust beware though, the standard price starts off at like 6.95.. But  if you get carried away with the extra sides... your ramen can come out to about $14 without you even realizing it!"

I didn't believe it until I took the first bite at Monta.\n\nIt was a chilly day, and nothing could beat the satisfaction found at the bottom of that ramen bowl. Monta is tucked in a small strip small. There's limited seating inside, but we didn't wait long at all and sat at the bar. I actually prefer this since we could watch the kitchen in action.\n\nEverything is EXTREMELY affordable. I got a huge bowl of ramen (with a few addition) for the same price as 1 fancy hot dog on the strip. I opted for the Tonkotsu and added corn and egg. We also had the Gyoza to start. The Gyoza were perfect, so light and airy. Dipping them in a mix of soy with sesame oil with a dash of their spices made it that much better. The bowl of ramen was huge! I tried to force myself to finish it because it was so good. I was going to add spices to the broth, but it was fantastic on its own so I didn't mess with it. The noodles were soft and the egg was the perfect addition. I wish I could have another bowl right now with this cold outside!\n\nWhat I also enjoyed about this restaurant was the design. It wasn't the typical meh photo with a description underneath. They took the time to take beautiful photos of all their dishes and explain them appropriately. It really makes a difference.\n\nThe staff was nice. The place was busy and they kept everything on pace. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."

If you like soup noodles, soups that takes hours to make, or melt in your mouth pork belly...then this is a must try. \n\nThis place is very small with minimum seating area and a limited menu.  Their main focus is their ramen and pork belly bowl, so if you do decide to make the trip out from the Strip of Las Vegas (about a 10 min taxi ride), then you have to try their Ramen and Pork Belly Bowl.  Tip:  Anticipate a wait due to the limited seating area.  Fortunately, we were in luck...no wait!  SCORE!!!  The prices here are very reasonable for the portion and the flavor you receive.  You are definitely getting your money worth.\n\nWe ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and a small Pork Belly Bowl.\n\nThe Pork Belly Bowl was a small size, but it was plenty for us since we totally devoured ourselves with tons of fantastic food on our trip to Vegas.  The bowl was pretty when it arrived!  The bowl was decorated with pickled ginger to cut the fattiness of the pork belly and an abundant amount of scallions to give the bowl a fresh green flavor.  Below the green and the red, was a pile of juicy, tender, and fatty pork belly gleaming at you. \n\nThen our star...Tonkotsu Ramen.  We added extra Chashu Pork, corn, butter, and EGG (this is a definite MUST add...super soft and melt in your mouth!) to our bowl of ramen.  I have to say, this was a delight to the eye.  The portion was a good size, about the equivalent of a large bowl of Pho.  The flavor of the soup was deep and meaty, the noodles had a good bite to it and every bite had the yummy soup flavoring (we saw them cook the noodles in the slow cooked broth), the pork was drool worthy, the crisp sweet corn added an additional tastiness to the bowl, and the black fungus and bamboos added earthiness.\n\nOverall a delicious experience...simple yet still makes us think about it all the time.  Of course not as good as the ramen you can get in Japan, but definitely pretty good for USA.  We would rate this place a 7 for flavor, price, and quality of ingredients."

In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\nI started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. Even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. Next time I drop by, I will probably give their fried rice a shot.\n\nMonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when I went. It started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles.

I know nothing about what is good and what isn't.

I've complained in other reviews about some restaurants (mostly Asian-type food) that overwhelm you with egg smells when you walk in.  This one was one of those restaurants, but it was not bad enough to make me turn around and walk out.  It still grosses me out, as I really hate eggs.   I ordered the Tonkatsu, and only added some green onions.  Really nice flavorful broth, and I've never had such tender, nicely cooked pork in my life.  Very very good.  Next time I would add more pork to the dish.\n\nMy only beefs about this place was that they didn't brew their own iced green tea, they serve it from a can, meaning no refills.  And, the portion sizes were huge and I couldn't finish it all.  I wish they would serve a smaller bowl.  Oh and veggies!

The service is quick and no frills but friendly. The menu is simple-there are four types of ramen and a variety of appetizers and alternative dishes like kimchi fried rice, gyoza, cold noodles and a pork belly bowl. Ramen comes with add ons like seasoned egg (SO GOOD), mustard greens, scallions, extra pork belly, corn and butter. \n\nThe broths are rich and flavorful and it's hard for me to pinpoint a favorite, but if I had to pick the tonkotsu-shoyu would probably be it. The noodles have that perfect ramen texture-chewy and slurpy, in a good way!\n\nBecause of the size of the space, it can be an intimate dining experience with complete strangers particularly if you sit at the bar. But it's also one of those places that solo dining isn't awkward and can actually be to your benefit when there is a line out the door.\n\nMonta is your spot for legit ramen with no pretense!"

The noodles are fresh and the broth, whether tonkatsu, miso, or shoyu, is always steaming hot and extremely flavorful.  I appreciate that it's the real stuff and not the packaged, powder crap other places use.  \n\nYes, Monta is a noodle house but their fried rice is just as good, if not better.  For someone who doesn't really like fried rice, I would come just for that.  Their gyoza was just okay.  I've had better.   \n\nEven though the place is (extremely) small, I like that it's cozy.  There was only one time when I actually had to wait for a table, but as always, the wait was worth it.  \n\nA basic bowl of ramen will cost you almost $8.  That's kind of steep, especially in the economy that we're in now.  An extra $1.50 for a hard boiled egg also seems a bit much, don't you think?  I guess it's really quality over quantity with this place. \n\nFour out of five stars because food quality is good, service is good, but pricing isn't the best.  This place is always a pleasure though.  If you haven't been, you probably should soon."

Not authentic korean but that ok because this is a Japanese restaurant, not korean.\nWhen you come you have to do the kaedama, more noodles.

            "review": "Its official; I made my quest here today and I'm already craving round 2. It's gooooood!\n\nFor those not in the know, I've been a ramen-iac since I was 12 and first learned how to cook myself a cup o' noodles. I spent several summers as a gawky teenager watching cartoons and gobbling noodles like a fiend. Over the years, and through thousands of packets of freeze-dried noodles I slurped onward. Kimchi flavor, Maruchan, Nissan, yam-noodles, dandan mien and instant jjangmyun, my adoration for the comfort of a big steaming bowl of chewy noodles drenched in broth steadily growing. I've tried Ichiza's, Shuseki's and making it myself- this tops the list. Ichiza's was close, but this place will most likely be my number one noodle-spot this winter. \n\nComing up to the restaurant, I wouldn't have thought it was open if it weren't for the neon sign saying so. There's plenty of parking and it's right across the street from the shopping center with Shuseki. \n\nI sat at the bar as I was having lunch alone and wanted to see the action. One chef would feel out the proper amount of fresh noodles per bowl, roughly a fistful, and drop them into the boiling cauldron of water. On the other side was a large kettle of broth steaming away, ready at a moment's notice. In the background several men worked on various other tasks involving the pork and other side dishes. At the front of the bar was the Vegas Weekly magazine that mentioned them, as well as a Good-luck Kitty, which I thought was cute.\n\nToday, I opted for the miso. At first I couldn't decide- I'd tried the miso flavors at other establishments, so should I continue the trend for consistency of comparison, or deviate and expand my horizons further. I opted for the miso with nitamago, or egg. It didn't take long before my noodles were politely presented to me.\n\nThe broth: Super porky. No MSG taste at all. Rich miso flavor-seemed like it was all white [sweet] miso. Great depth of flavor, with an intense, buttery mouth feel. Hit all the right notes and was intensely satisfying. Tastes like homemade.\n\nNoodles: Al dente egg noodles. Chewy and lots of them! Much better than anything instant with great slurpability. \n\nThe egg: Beautifully cooked, creamy and custardy, it added an entirely new level of complexity to the broth and had an exceptional texture. Ichiza's eggs are close, but the one I had here was supple and gelatinous, cooked slowly and well. It was easily the best egg I've had in a restaurant this year. \n\nPork: My bowl came with 2 slices of succulent, fall-apart tender pork. I could pull bite-size pieces off using my chopsticks. Thousands of times better than the terrifying piece of pork we were served at Shuseki. The pieces were thin, but I was satisfied with the amount I was given. You can always order more if you're willing to pay the additional charge. \n \nExtras: The ramen comes with bamboo shoots, a few pieces of mushroom and a mountain of green onion. You can also add minced garlic paste, benishoga [red pickled ginger], sesame oil, furikake mix, sesame seeds, what looked like vinegar & a couple of other options are available either through the menu or asking your server.\n\nI found the portion large enough for a late brunch, tiding me over for hours and powering me through a trip to the dog park with 3 rowdy puppies. I'm extremely satisfied and happy with the meal I had here, and I bragged to several of my friends. I'm looking forward to trying the shoyu flavor next, as well as trying the spicy greens with it. \n\nI'll be back very soon!"

I don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  And yes, they do use different noodles for the Tonkotsu ramen versus the others.  The tonkotsu ramen is Hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  They cook theirs a little more here than they do in Hakata, but it's still great.\nAnyway, having tried the miso ramen, I'd say give this one a shot too.  It's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs.\nI also have to recommend the chahan (fried rice), it is super peppery and delicious.  Just the way I remember it from my highschool days in Japan.\nA second note.  Anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  I keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for.\nAs always, they're eager to please, and definitely worth seeing, so help Monta stay busy, and maybe even expand.  I would love to see more of these guys."

The gyoza had that crispy-tender fried crust on the bottom that I never quite manage at home, and the pork belly bowl had some serious depth-- tender, tasty pork, fresh green onions & carrots on top, and the rice on the bottom was just fantastic, flavored nicely by the sauce/juices of the pork.\n\nLike everyone else says, the wait can be seriously bad-- it's a small space, and though they do their best to move everyone through asap, the food takes time to come out (as it should!). It doesn't help that if you're there with a group, you're probably going to end up ordering extras to try once you've had anything on the menu."

Don't make that mistake, Monta Ramen is actually in the plaza before that street. Google map takes you to this empty plaza with nothing but a sleazy looking massage parlor. Hmmm....? \n\nThis small hole in the wall restaurant interior reminds me of Daikokuya Jtown LA but even smaller! They had an L shaped bar which probably sits 10-12 people max. There were about 5-6 regular tables, some made for two people & some made for four. What happens in a place like this? A number of overflowing people waiting out the door. I recommend you coming early or during non-peaked hours. We got lucky because there was only one party ahead of us when we got in but that quickly changed. By the time we got out, there were at least 10 parties on that waiting list.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the array of condiments in front of us. Shredded pink ginger, purified garlic, white pepper, Japanese chili powder, SPICY a$$ hot chili oil, vinegar, soy sauce just to name a few. Love restaurants that aren't all hipster tight up the butt about their condiments.\n\nHad the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen, a mixed blend of pork bone and soy sauce type soup based. The first one I've ever had actually since I'm typically accustomed to just Tonkotsu base. It was a little less rich and thick then the Tonkotsu base but still had that cloudy and strong taste. I added an egg and kimchi for a little more. For you carb lovers, you can add extra noodles for a minimal fee. I was quite satisfied with my ramen. My expectations were met even though they weren't that high since we were in Vegas and we know LA is crawling with bomb ramen houses. The chashu pork was quite fatty and the slices were on a smaller scale. The bowl of ramen itself was enough to make you full but not overly stuffed.\n\nAlso ordered the mini mentaiko bowl - cod fish row, seaweed, green onion, over rice. Nothing significant to report. The fried gyozas (pork and vegetable filling) were decent.\n\nThe ramen is nothing to die for but it really wasn't too bad. If you have a mad craving for ramen or just want to get something other than pho on Spring Mountain Road aka Chinatown, then Monta Ramen is there for you. Just be ready for a wait time. The ramen met my simple standards and the price was very affordable. The hard working staff are efficient and all \"peace sign\" fobby smiles."

There is a $10 minimum for card.\n\nThe waitresses are obviously experienced and seemlessly work together and with the chefs to efficiently serve customers. They are friendly, but not overly so. Food comes quickly as well because their menu is pretty small.\n\nMy usual order is a miso ramen with corn. The main reason I get corn is because the broth is a little too salty. Many people complain about this but I never really felt the extent of Monta's salty broth until the past year or so. It just seems thicker and more unhealthy than it used to be. I'm not sure if their recipes changed or if my tastes changed.\n\nYou get nori, chashu, and bamboo. Condiments you can add include garlic puree, pickled ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and chili powder. One thing that used to bother me when I first started coming here was that they only have green tea iced and in a can. \n\nThey also have a few other dishes besides the various ramen, including rice bowls, friend rice, cold noodles, and gyoza. For recent additions to the menu, they have the option to make your noodles spicy (+$1) or the kuro ramen, which is black garlic ramen. It's actually pretty tasty in my opinion, but I am an avid eater of garlic.\n\nRegardless of the heavy mouthfeel of the ramen, the consistent service and food keeps regulars like me coming back."

They don't have hot drinks, so enjoy some UCC Oolong or Green Tea or a can of Calpico (I wish they had UCC Iced Coffee!!)  We placed our order and watched as the crowd built up very quickly.  Food arrived fast and piping hot.\n\nThe gyoza was fine - crunchy on one side, steamed on the other, hot all the way through.  My mom and hubs got the pork belly bowls and my dad and I got the miso ramen (I got mine with corn)\n\nThe charsiu/chashu/chasyu (how ever you want to spell it) WAS SO AMAZING - I do not use this phrase lightly.  It was LITERALLY melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The pork fat was flavorful and rich and just melted away when it hit your tongue.  So amazing!  I am sad that I didn't stop and order a side of it immediately.\n\nThe ramen noodles had a great chewy texture and the miso broth was delicious.  My mom was very pleased with the pork belly bowl, as well.\n\nThe only thing that didn't live up to everything else was the mentaiko bowl.  I got it because I love hot rice and tarako (and my mom had made some for me the night before and I was still jonesing for it).  Unfortunately, the rice was not very hot and a little on the dry side, so the bowl was disappointing.  I ladeled some of the miso broth into the bowl and that made the rice more palatable, but it messed with the flavor of the mentaiko.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go to Vegas again so I can go to Monta again! \n\n**ACCESSIBILITY NOTE - The parking lot is not very wheelchair friendly and Monta itself can be a little tight to try to get a wheelchair in and out.  The only wheelchair ramp up from the parking lot is blocked by the car when you park in the handicapped space, so once you get the person into their chair, you have to move the car to get them up to the sidewalk level where the restaurants are."

If you only get 1 bowl of ramen, choose one with pork broth. It is way better than the light-tasting chicken broth. This is a great off-the-strip lunch and worth the drive. Get in the know and hit up this place!"

The line eventually got crazy. But the ramen here was fantastic! I've had ramen all over the world but this was one of the BEST ever. I realize waiting in line sucks but this place was worth the wait. I tried the black garlic oil Kuro ramen and it was hands down the best bowl of ramen I ever had. We also tried the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it had great flavor as well. Best to get here 30 mins early and just wait before the line becomes crazy but you will be glad you did."

If youre confused about what ramen is, its just noodles and broth and you get to pick your additional toppings or mix ins or whatever. This place has a chicken broth, a pork broth, or half and half. Its acually really good. It is a little salty, and I wish they had a few more choices for the additional add ins, but I would definitely go back. It is a tiny place, and they wont seat you unless the whole party is there."

Alright.\n\nCame here because a few friends raved about it and it looked like it had amazing reviews, came half an hour before opening time just to make sure we wouldn't have to wait too long. luckily my group of about 20 just barely fit behind a few other couples. very small place that seats less than 30?\n\nThe ramen wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't all that great. I'm from LA so I guess I probably am lucky to have much more options but you would figure Vegas has the best of all worlds. Compare to anything else I've ever had around LA, this was much more salty, portions were a tad bit smaller, other than the saltiness not that flavorful. Menu here is small but some Japanese restaurants tend to be so that wasn't too big of a surprise.\n\nYou definitely have to be a pork lover because that's pretty much all they have, if I remember right they have approximately four different ramen choices, and a few other side dishes like fried rice and gyoza.\n\nIf you are a local I'm sure this may be as good as it gets? But if you're from out of town only try this place if there is no wait. Totally not worth a wait."

I feel that the tonkotsu was a good choice to test out the restaurant so I ordered a bowl with egg and corn added.  The total cost was around $10.  The menu seems to range around there with extras for onion, corn, egg, etc. for an extra charge.  The ramen was great.  I don't have much comparison but it was tasty and filling.\n\nMonta Ramen has that must-visit reputation so there's always lines.  It's located in probably the most renowned shopping plaza in Chinatown so add no parking on top of the wait time.  The restaurant only has a handful of table and counter space as well.  The service is really fast and good, but it just takes a while to sit.\n\nDefinitely give Monta a try.  It has such a high reputation that if you are a true ramen fan, then hopefully this will be your joint.  They also have a second location in Henderson that hardly ever has lines if you hate that hipster line disease."

It was my first time having authentic Ramen and it was delicious.  The pork, abundant in portion just melts in your mouth and the broth - my lord, the broth was creamy and rich and thick and so tasty.  The bowls were the perfect size too! My boyfriend and I joked that this is better than pho, but I put pho in a totally different category ;) \n\nWe came here around lunchtime during the weekday and on both occasions, there was about a 10-15 minute wait, but it's worth it guys! It's definitely easier if you're a single diner or just the two of you.  A party of 3 or more -- be prepared to wait.  The place was rather small so I got worried, but the staff are efficient and people are in and out.  We were seated at the counter closest to the kitchen, so it got pretty hot while waiting and eating our ramen, but it wasn't too bad.  For the amount you get and the absolute tastiness of everything -- it was worth every bit of wait and effort especially for being under $10 for a bowl.  \n\nI recently came back to DC and decided to try another ramen joint in the city and it didn't even come close.  Boyfriend and I were really disappointed because Monta Ramen has set the bar high for us and I cannot wait to come back to Vegas just for another bowl! \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you're traveling or trying Ramen for the first time.  You will not regret it! The Spicy Tonkotsu wasn't even spicy for those who are hesitant  about the level of spice.  The dumplings were also delicious and fresh.  I miss you, Monta Ramen, and all the over delicious Asian eats in Vegas!"

We tried the goyza (I make this fresh at home and restaurants never beat my fresh ones but since it has such good reviews we tried it). If your a fan, definitely order them! So good!! I got the shoyu with boiled egg and cashu pork. The pork just melts in your mouth and the egg adds a nice texture to it. My Dad got the tonkastu with the cashu pork and loved that as well. Both types had amazing flavor, and we're just like the ones we fell in love with in Japan. \n\nIf I could give this place 6 stars I would!!!"

One of my best friends is obsessed with it and I didn't understand why until now.  The only thing I have had is the shoya (soy) ramen and it was a religious experience for me and it might be a while before I try anything else.  \n\nImagine a bowl of broth that taste like the most amazing piece of seasoned caramelized roasted pork ever, it's not thick but has that velvety satisfying stock feel that only comes from stewing all that flavor and goodness from bones for endless hours.  \n\nNow in the broth, perfectly al dente noodles that soaked up all that awesome flavor.  They are al dente, you still have to chew them but they are by no means undercooked.  Then take slow roasted pork bellies that are so tender that you could cut it with, I don't know, a piece of grass, and slice it and float in on top.  Along with that add just a few slivers of some vegetable things that are cooked so they are just barely firmer than the noodles along with a touch of scallions.\n\nThe only thing that would be more porkly satisfying would be a pork loin wrapped in bacon.  It is crazy but it somehow reminds me of one of my favorite things in the world, carnitas.  Well it hits the same spot at least.  It's perfect too because it's got enough fat so you know you are eating pork but it's still lean-ish so you don't feel like killing yourself via hara-kiri after (It's the perfect lunch).  I mean I worked out about an hour after the last time I had it, try doing that after a carnitas plate.  I love pho but this ramen flipped my noodle soup world on it's head.  I can't sleep right now I just want to go back and eat more.  \n\nP.S.  I have seen this place here before on this site and had it bookmarked but then I saw it pop up in the book \"Eating Las Vegas\" as one of the best 50 spots in vegas."

After looking at the menu I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which is a rich pork broth with two slices of melt in your mouth pork with wood-ear mushrooms and scallions.  I added the Nitamago which is a seasoned hard-boiled egg.  This meal did not disappoint.  It came to the table within 10 minutes and was a great looking bowl of ramen.  Very savory and fresh.  We also had the Gyoza  which is a pan-fried pork and vegetable dumpling.  My brother ordered the Takana pork-fried rice.  This rice was a nice addition to our ramen bowls.  \n\nJust a note:  As our ramen bowls were delivered I looked up and noticed that Monta Ramen must have a lot of fans because the little doorway was filled with people waiting to eat but the line also went out the door.

At 11:40 AM on a sunday morning, only a few minutes after they opened, the place was already FILLED. My bf and I snatched the last few seats at the bar. Ended up being a fun experience! We watched the nice chefs prepare our meals ;)\n\nDon't even try to get a big party in here... I think the largest table fits 6 people?\n\nParking: good size shared lot\n\nService: good, quick? Gets a little busy and they might need more servers..\n\nFOOD: come here for the RAMEN, I mean... why would you come to a ramen shop for... fried rice =.= I gotta admit the flavor here is a quite different from all the tonkotsu i've had in LA? But it's a worth-trying difference!\n\n+Tonkotsu ramen (4/5) it was very very RICH , THICK and FLAVORFUL, maybe it's because i'm not Japanese and can't appreciate the ultra richness, it felt a bit over whelming at the end of the bowl. Maybe the tonkotsu-shoyu would be a good texture.\n\n+the flavored egg (5/5) omg, please do add this to your bowl, it is soooooo gooood, im drooling a bit just writing this review. I wish they can just make this part of the bowl instead of an add-on\n\n+pork belly rice bowl (4.5/5) it was really good! moist and flavorful, one of the better pork belly bowls i've had!!! Do order this instead of the fried rice\n\n-why is the \"spicy\" upgrade costs extra?!?!??! RAWR\n\nOVERALL, my bf and I had a solid lunch for a decent price tag.

There is always a line by 1115-1120 when I usually am nonchalantly rushing to the line in fear I'll miss my window of opportunity to enjoy my oh so fabulous bowl of noodles. It is small and fills up fast and they don't seat you unless your whole party is there which sends me into another panic until The boyfriend shows up and I can breathe again. Also they only seat singles at the bar heads up, no table for you, no room for your laptop, this is not a working lunch spot. In and out. Once you're done you'll feel the eyes stating at you till you leave with your head down feeling like you might have taken just a little too long to enjoy your grub. \n\nThe service is always spot on and fast. Sometimes they ask if its ok sometimes not, I don't care though its always good! Sometimes being the first customers the wait for the food is sometimes sluggish with all the orders going in at once but I understand and gives us time to chat and admire the others. I always get my Ramen with corn and butter hold the shrooms. Yea I know they're not poisonous but these shrooms are just weird to me. The Boyfriend gets the Pork Belly Bowl and always shares generously, we'd have a fight on our hands if he didn't. This thing is to die for! Yummy baconey porky deliciousness! You won't regret it!"

My friend and I got a massage right next to the place and was ready for dinner when we saw the line outside Monta and got curious. Went inside and saw a small six table dive-ish kind of place so looked at Yelp for some guidance. Once I saw the reviews, I know its a match made in heaven. I signed in so we can get a table and waited 10 mins to get seated. We were lucky because there's only three parties ahead of us. We sat by the bar and ordered 2 gyoza, fried rice, pork belly bowl, a Kura Ramen for me and Shoyu ramen for my friend. The service was quick and efficient and it wasn't long till we feasted on this scrumptious food. First off, the bowls of ramen are huge!!! My black garlic ramen with extra egg was so good I am thinking about it until  now. The broth had depth of flavor and I relished every single spoonful. The noodles were al dente and tasted fresh and went well with the black garlic seasoning, I can eat it all day long. No regrets after I decided to be adventurous and try black garlic anything for the first time. Now on to the Gyoza - they were pillows of soft savory goodness with a slight crunch from being pan friend. The meat was lightly seasoned and was perfect with a lil bit of chili oil and soy sauce dipping sauce. The pork belly bowl was a good sized bowl (I ordered a small) and hit all the right spots with the tender pork belly coupled with the fragrant rice. It was the best $45 meal I have ever had in my entire life. I wish there was one in Houston. I am dreaming of coming back to Vegas just for this. And oh, don't even think about saving it for next day. Enjoy it while you can, and how it should be - fresh on the day of ordering and don't complain about it not being quite the same the following day. As a ramen enthusiast, Ramen is best enjoyed fresh and hot. I cannot wait to go back!!! Now on to dreaming about it again"

Run over across to one of the other spots in the plaza or over to the market across the street. \n\nI get the Miso Ramen and ask for them to make it spicy. You can ask for the spicy ball on the side if you want.\n\nThe noodles are pretty firm and chewy. They don't leave a waxy feeling in your mouth. Kaedama (extra noodles) are only a buck fifty more too.\n\nThe broth is where it's at though. It's really thick and tasty. I normally get around 4 noodles (1 original and 3 extra) in before I need extra spicy sauce or something to thicken it up. \n\nI'd say this is the number two spot, just can't eek out Ippudo, sorry!"

This movie is amazing and it's about foodie ramen culture in Japan.  They are as authentic as it comes.  Just like the movie, the ramen is cooked al dente, the pork slices are placed carefully, the soup is hot and the broth is flavorful.  All the toppings are there and we were so excited we replicated a part of Tanpopo when the zen ramen master mindfully eats his ramen.  \n\nI knew this place was it when I ate everything and drank the broth to the bottom of the bowl.  The soft boiled eggs are a must.\n\nThis place is amazing and the menu is simple and they just added the shoyu ramen which is by far my favorite.\n\nthe shoyu ramen is light broth not overly salty, the tonkatsu is very meaty and flavorful and they use a different noodle.  I prefer the ramen noodles that come with the miso ramen though.  The miso ramen is delicious but, a little to salty (but, authentic for japanese taste)\n\nI wouldn't get their gyoza again.  pretty generic and expensive.\n\nthe ramen is cheap coming in at under $7 for the tonkatsu and $8 for the miso.\n\nThis place is damn good.  I went their for dinner and was so impressed I went back for lunch again the next day driving all the way from Henderson.  \n\nMonta is pretty authentic looking and I hope it does well because I love little hole in the wall gems."

I didn't have any add-ins and I was so full! \n\nMy daughter had just had her wisdom teeth out a few days prior and was dying for some real food. She had the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen.

By the time she was done eating her ramen, she had a rosy glow in her cheeks and she perked up 100%! It was like ambrosia. \n\nWe loved this place so much that when my friend came to visit from the San Francisco Bay Area the next day, we went again. My friend is a food snob and was leery that Monta would be anywhere near as good as her beloved Orenchi in Santa Clara (I've eaten there, it is heavenly). Monta definitely passed her high standards. I couldn't get her to admit that Monta was better, but she did agree that it was at least equal!\n\nVery friendly and attentive staff. Small eating area, but just make sure you come before or after the normal busy times. We didn't have a wait either time when we went around 6:30pm, but worth the wait if you have to. \n\nIf you are looking for a good ramen place, this is it!

Great for the price, but it's $10 for the ramen plus a couple ingredients.  The service is ALWAYS fast.  I mean, how hard is it with less than 20 seats?  If something concerns you, the server is no more than 10 feet away- call for them when they pass by.\n\nThere are several kinds of soup base you can pick from- each explaining in good detail what they taste like.  They are never watery- very flavorful, and each side dish they give you to put into your soup is always fresh.  The ramen doesn't taste like cup noodle.\n\nSomeone earlier said that it's a typical, small Asian restaurant- get your food, eat, get the bill, get out.\n\nOk, that's true.

You will typically encounter a line as it is a small restaurant with only 5 tables and about 8 seats at their bar but well worth the wait! If you're thirsty for some Boba just go next door to Kung Fu while you wait! Enjoy everyone!"

The chasu was really fatty, which some people like but it isn't my cup of tea. The noodles were good but overall nothing spectacular."

I was at the end of the bar practically inside the kitchen. There was a wait, as usual, but as usual, the wait is worth it. I brought a ramen enthusiast friend from out of town. He ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with egg and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with mustard greens. We also split an order of the pork belly over rice. LET ME TELL YOU. This pork belly over rice was so silky and delicious that I didn't want my ramen anymore. I didn't even need the pork belly. The oils and the flavors of the pork just sinks into the rice and the rice alone is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The ramen is no joke either. The texture of the noodles stays perfect throughout the entire meal. They don't become so bloated with soup that they turn into mush. I hate mushy noodles. My friend ate his entire ramen bowl down to the last drop of soup! Now heed this warning: The portion sizes are not of America! If you think you are going to get this huge bowl of unfinishable noodles and broth, YOU'RE A GLUTTON. The portion size is just right and leaves you with JUST enough room for you to share an appetizer and have a cup of tea. This isn't the type of place for socializing. Eat your noodles and GTFO so that all of the other hopeful patrons can share a piece of the heaven that you have just experienced."

I thought to myself, \"heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because I've heard a lot of good things about this place!\" Tried the food. Wasn't impressed. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and a mini mentaiko bowl. I expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. A few minutes later, the shoyu ramen came. Too salty for my tastes. \nMy cousin ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and I tried it. I wish I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasn't AS salty, but still pretty salty. My dad ordered a miso ramen. Again, it was salty.\n You get the gist.\n\nAside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and fried rice. The fried rice was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. Neato.\nMaybe I'll come back when I'm low on sodium intake. \n\nThe only good thing was the service. I wouldn't recommend this for big groups because the place is pretty small and it's usually packed whenever I'm around the area."

When I read in some reviews that this wasn't the type of place you linger at, I was afraid that service might be a bit brusque. Nope! You get an enthusiastic greeting of \"Irasshaimase!\" from the couple of servers on the floor and the noodle chefs in the open kitchen behind the bar. Our server was courteous and we did not feel hurried. There's counter seating around the bar and maybe 5 four-tops in addition. It's not a big place, so there might be a wait if your party is larger than one or two. The AC was cranked up, which made for a very pleasant dining experience, considering you're eating hot soup in the desert.\n\nI loved the concept of standard toppings and adding what you want on top of it. I added the seasoned egg to my bowl, which had a perfectly set, slightly gooey middle. The tonkotsu was thick and cloudy, with plenty of collagen dissolved in the soup to give you that lip-smacking sensation. Noodles were perfectly chewy, although you had to slurp fast so the hot soup didn't soften them too much. They also have Sapporo on tap in schooner sizes. Perfect, because my tummy can only hold so much liquid. \n\nThis is definitely worth a stop whether you are heading into or out of Las Vegas."

Orders are taken promptly by pleasant wait staff, and your meal is turned around quickly as well, within 10 minutes.\n\nTheir ramen are overall the best I've had - not greasy, fresh, with nicely firm noodles - although from pure taste standpoint I probably prefer Hiromaru (RIP).  Their fried rice is really good, as is the chashu don.  These are more like side dishes from size standpoint, but probably too much for one person to have a ramen and one of these.  Maybe 2 ramen dishes and one will work for two...

It's comfort food for my fiance and I especially after the Bellagio buffet dinner on the night before.\n\nThe place was very small and there were people waiting when I got there.  They won't sit you unless all of your party are present which is nice so no one can hog up the table.\n\nWe ordered Tonkotsu ramen with extra ramen, and flavored egg, gyoza and takana fried rice.  Everything was excellent.  The takana fried rice was very different than the regular Japanese fried rice.  It has a very nice kick to the taste too.  My fiance and really enjoyed the food and would definitely come back whenever we are in town!\n\nThe place is cash only."

            "review": "Whenever I wanted to eat ramen in Las Vegas the best option was to stay home and cook a bag of Maruchan. Why is that you ask? Because at least then I'm already prepared to be disappointed. The ramen scene in Vegas is not that great, there are few choices of where to go and even fewer options of what type to order.\n\nHearing from my friends that we were planning to visit a new ramen place I got quite excited. Were we finally going to find a place worth eating ramen at after all these years? The simple answer, yes.\n\nAs soon as I walked into Monta I knew that this was going to be a place we would eat again. The decor was simplistic in nature and at the same time very enchanting. There were few seats, maybe 26 at most, but you didn't feel cramped at all. We chose to sit at the bar seating and got a great view of the chefs at work.\n\nA first look at the menu told me that there were three different types of ramen to choose from. This may not seem like a lot but accompanying that was a decent sized list of sides that you can add for a small price. As my nickname is Miso, I decided to stay true to it and order the miso ramen. I requested no bamboo shoots or mushrooms, that come with the order at no extra cost along with some slices of pork. I also decided to add an egg to my order because egg in my opinion makes everything better.\n\nThe staff there was very upbeat and happily took our orders. They were very chatty with each other, but not in a bad way. This is the kind of staff that you know they enjoy their work. If anyone needed a refill on their drink the staff was very quick to notice and refill them without any trouble.\n\nAs the food arrived all of us looked at our food putting off the first bite in fear of being disappointed once again by another bowl of ramen, boy were we wrong. The first bite was amazing and with that we began to devour our dinner with gusto. The flavor of the miso was a little on the salty side but not so much to over power it. The noodles were prepared well and the texture was enjoyable. The egg that I had ordered did not disappoint, and the pork was a pleasure to eat. The size of the order was enough to make me content. Had I wanted more there was an option for more noodles for $2.00, which is not that bad at all.\n\nOverall the experience at Monta was a great one. It may not be the best ramen out there, but it is for sure the best ramen you are going to find here in Vegas. The pricing is reasonable, the order came out to under $10.00, and the food did not disappoint. If you are looking for some good ramen, Monta is the place to go in town! We will most definitely be making return visits in the future!"

Most of my reviews on Yelp have 3, and the rare 4 stars. This is worth 5 stars. \nI went here with a friend, were a couple minutes late and had to wait. It's not in the best place in the shopping center, but doesn't matter much. Get here when they open if you don't want to wait.\nWe ordered their specialty Tankatsu ramen, and was served within 10 minutes (very quick). Noodles were packaged, but very good. The roasted pork on top was thin, but tender and flavorful. The rest of the toppings; mushrooms and bamboo shoots and green onion helped the ramen nicely. What makes it all go together was the soup stock. Amazing. \nOn top of that, for $7 the price is totally right. Not too cheap, not too expensive. And worth every penny.\n\nLike other reviews compare, the only contender to Monta Ramen is Sora Ramen. I suggest Monta first, definitely. I believe it's on an entire different level than Sora. But, Sora's extra cost does get you more: Thicker meat, more soup, a tad bit better topping, but the noodles and soup stock isn't as good.\n\nSecond visit: Still amazing. Had the mini mentaiko bowl. It was good, and a nice side.\nThird visit: Still amazing.\nFourth, fifth, sixth... seventh... I forgot how many times I've been here, but it still blows me away. I had the Miso ramen and that was very good as well."

I usually order a Tonkotsu or a Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with extra Pork Chashu (4pcs for 2.50). Occasionally I also get the regular size Pork Belly Bowl.\n\nTheir ramen broth is full of flavor and you can mix and match a variety of different toppings to your liking for a cheap price. They give you a large and filling amount of ramen in your first bowl and if you're still hungry you can order another bowl of ramen noodles (Kaedama) for $1.50\nYou do need to save some of your broth though because they will give you a bowl of noodles and that's it.\n\nAs much as I want to give this place 5 stars, the only thing holding me back is their service. I always feel like I am being rushed to order, eat, pay, and leave so another party can take my seat. I don't blame them because it's always packed and they have to fit everyone who has been waiting in line, but it does suck when you feel like you're being rushed to eat good food.\n\nOverall, I love this place. I try not to come here with large parties because of the amount of time it would take to get the open tables. But this is definitely one of my favorite places for a good, affordable meal."

Food is amazing. We had tonkatsu shoyu ramen with flavored egg, pork belly bowl, and kimchi fried rice. The ramen was very traditional, well-flavored but not overpowering. The pork belly bowl was incredible. The pork is soft and bursting with flavor. Their rice is actually a nice texture, too - sticky without being mushy and not hard in the middle. The kimchi fried rice, while not spicy, had an irresistible taste. It was rich without feeling like too much. When we are in Vegas, we definitely expect to come back."

Although I preferred the spicy miso ramen over the tonkotsu shoyu, they were both incredibly heavy and beyond rich. The bowl and noodles were piping hot, but the broth was just warm. \n\nWe couldn't finish our bowls and left about 65% of it back (noodles and broth). After our dinner, our stomachs had a hard time digesting the richness and we felt a little nauseous. We could of shared one bowl of ramen, it was super filling and we had a ton of leftovers. \n\nThis is the first time I've ever regretted adding extra toppings on my ramen. The toppings didn't enhance or compliment our ramen. It all got lost in the thick salty broth. Plus the topping choices were rather boring, the best had to of been: corn, kimchi, and nitamago (flavored egg) - the kimchi was fresh and flavorful and they have perfected their soft-boiled egg!\n\nHere's what we ordered: \nTonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with thin noodles (I didn't care for these noodles) and 2 slices of chashu (and with all of the extras):\n+dried seaweed - pretty boring\n+corn - I loved the corn's sweetness and texture \n+nitamago (flavored soft boiled egg)- perfect! \n+mustard leaf - mushy and flavorless\n+shredded green onion - adds nice texture and freshness\n+butter - this ramen doesn't need more richness! \n$12.45 \n\nSpicy Miso Ramen with thick wavy noodles (the best noodles!) and 2 slices of thin chashu (and with all of the extras):\n+dried seaweed - boring\n+corn - great!\n+nitamago (flavored egg) - great! \n+mustard leaf - boring and mushy\n+shredded green onion - adds freshness\n+butter - this ramen does not need more richness! :x\n$13.75\n\nSide of extra chashu $2.50 - super fatty and buttery. \n\nSide of Kimchi $1 - very fresh and flavorful. \n\nSmall pork belly bowl $3.95 - this was my favorite. The pork belly was tender, buttery, and rich in flavor. The rice was cooked perfectly and the green onion and sweet pickled ginger added perfect freshness to the rice bowl.\n\nAfter eating here, it really made me miss Santouka Ramen in Costa Mesa, CA and Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen in Fountain Valley, CA. :/"

My family were in Vegas and my sister knew of a tasty ramen place so we decided to truck on down to Monta Noodle House.  Over all, the experience was pretty good.  I have to say this stacks up pretty well compared to some of the ramen places in California like Santouka or Shin Sen Gumi.  I think the defining factor is the broth itself.  Whether you're down for thick hearty broth or straight up thin broth, that's up to you.  I personally dig the heartiness of this place and definitely wouldn't mind going here again.  Ten points to Monta."

They have multiple soup base and different add-ons. So it's line a customizable ramen shop. Build-a-ramen. The noodles are cooked well, they aren't bloated, the base is very flavorful, and the meat literally melts in your mouth. Service here is beyond excellent.

Five minutes later, the crowds rolled in... \n\nI love that the menu is so simple and straight to the point. I got the Miso Ramen, which is my favorite broth that I usually get when I try a new ramen place for good comparison. I added the sliced chasu pork that is roasted right there in the kitchen in plain view and the seasoned soft boiled egg that they use a piece of thread to slice in half; both really tasty and the pork, tender. The noodles were cooked to aldente perfection and the piping hot broth was hearty, thick, and nutty tasting. \n\nWe'll definitely come back to this ramen place on our future Vegas visits even if we have to fight the crowds!"

I also ordered the kimchee fried rice as well for $6.95. \n\nAwesome execution for both I may say! I loved the texture of the noodle. It was soft, but it still had that firm bite that you take into it. That's how I like my ramen! It also hd a very tender slice of pork in it and a few other garnishes. I loved the Shoyu broth. I don't know what else to say! It wasn't salty or overpowering. It was just right. Not too salty, and the broth was very nice with the mixture of the meat in it. YAY BROTHINESS!\n\nKimchee fried rice is also of A+ quality. You can taste that nice grill taste to it. The cut o the kimchee was small and so were the small bits of egg which is how I like it too be. So YAY KIMCHEE FRIED RICE! \n\nIt's such a good price too so I felt like I got more than what I payed for. The service was awesome. The server was very cheery and upbeat and attentive which I loved. So...YAY SERVICE! Thumbs up for such personal service in such a little place. I just love how authentic Japanese restaurants like to keep things small, simple, and intimate. YAY JAPAN!"

This place is super tiny, but the turnover seemed as speedy as it could be. It was cold outside and there was no shelter from the cold. I would NEVER wait to eat at this place during the HEAT of summer!!! Impossible!!! \n\nWhen we finally got seated, our orders were taken promptly. Surprised to find a little cubby to stash my stuff under the bar!!! Clever!!! I LOVED my Sapporo on tap. Sitting at the bar gave us a bird's eye view on how the food, especially the pork roasts were prepared. The logs of pork roasts were seared on something that looks like a huge George Forman grill. Oh!!!!! If you could only hear the sizzle of the hot grill & the smell the wonderful umami flavor of roast pork!!! The roasts are then placed into an oven and cooked until tender. This pork is then cut into nice generous slices to garnish the ramen or cut up into the fried rices. I take the time to mention what I witnessed because you feast not only with your palate but also with your other senses as well. I love that they roasted the pork & didn't just boil or steam them to oblivion. This is probably what makes this ramen house so yummy...the care in how the pork is prepared. \n\nWhat we ordered...\n\nSpicy Tonkotsu ramen...the most popular ramen on Yelp. Also highly recommended by those drooling to get in. I hear that corn & butter add-ons are a must!! \nThe broth was delicious, the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was garnished with nice big round slices of roast pork. In most ramen houses, the chasu is often half fat... although there is nothing wrong with some good fat. These slices were mostly meaty. Yay!!! \n\nPork belly bowl...also popular on Yelp, but the pork in my bowl wasn't crispy at all. Good, but not as good as the....\n\nKimchee fried rice....surprisingly VERY GOOD!! I am usually skeptical to order \"Korean\" items at Japanese restaurants and vice versa, but it tasted SO GOOD!!! The big juicy pieces of pork made the rice so decadent!!! Yum!!!!\n\nI didn't take off any stars for the wait...they can't help that they're a fabulous popular place!!! :D"

San Francisco is one of the best foodie towns but it fails miserably in terms of ramen offerings.\n\nWe stopped by Monta on a recent trip to Vegas.  It is located on Spring Mountain road like most of the other popular nearby offstrip spots and is located in the same strip as Raku and Kung Fu Tea.  The parking lot is a bit tight and can fill up pretty quickly on busy nights but there is street parking and we have used the lot opposite of the strip (store was closed).\n\nThere was a short wait at Monta as expected but it was reasonable - only 3 other names on the clipboard.  The shop consisted of a long L shaped bar and 10 or so small tables.  Not a huge place but not small either.  We all ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and Tanaka fried rice as recommended.  The default toppings were a bit sparse (pork, bamboo, ginger, 'shrooms) but considering the price (under $7) I didn't mind.  I added a soft boiled egg to mine - other standard toppings were available (corn, more pork, butter, etc) We were pleasantly surprised at the turnaround for the ramen - within 5-10 minutes.\n\nThe broth carried plenty of flavor but was a bit thicker than the other ramen shops.  The noodles were thin and firm but not overly so.  The bowl only came with 2 slices of pork but it was expertly prepared - tender with a good combination of meat and fat.  There was a slight aftertaste (from MSG?) but easily queched from the Kung Fu milk tea from next door.\n\nThe fried rice was solid but a bit salty.  It was more than likely from the mustard leaves either being too abundant or just overly salty themselves.  Not bad but I may go with the potstickers or simply stick with the ramen next time.\n\nA definite stop for me in Vegas the next time I am craving something soupy or noodles."

If you have a saltier taste bud, you might try the tonkotsu/shoyu broth combination.  Personnally, I like the regular tonkotsu best, but you won't go wrong with the combination broth.  I have also tried their gyoza, which was ok and nothing special, but hey, I'm here for the ramen and pork. =)\n\nThe only issue I have about this place is the price or serving size.  The ramen bowl is $6.99.  If you have a decent appetite, you'd have to order extra noodles ($1.50) or extra pork ($2.50), which is ok.  However, if you have a bigger appetite, you might have to order gyoza or other side dishes in addition, which can increase the overall cost of your meal.\n\nIf you have tried Shinsengumi in LA, this restaurant is the most similar in taste.

            "review": "Now that I've come here enough to practically remember the whole menu, I think it's ready for a review. \n\nWhen I found this place (through Yelp of course) I thought to myself, \"Could it be? A true authentic ramen place that the city I originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? My own little NYC Momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?\" OH, SWEET BABY JESUS IT COULD! \n\nBefore making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you're going and at what time. This place is SMALL, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! The first time I came here I literally drove by and was like, \"awh hailll noo,\" and drove away. HOWEVER I will say that if there's just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. The tables turn over rather quickly.\n\nWhich leads me to the menu. It's very simple and quick to prepare. If you're going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: Shoyu (chicken), Tonkotsu (pork), Tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and Miso. All are priced around 6.95 a bowl. Just forget the rest and go with the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. All ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped green onion. Don't forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and mustard leaf! If you've never tried mustard leaf, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! Adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. Just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it's okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self! \n\nThey have other items as well such as fried rice, small plates, and cold ramen! I still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit! \n\nThe only negative thing I'd have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but I'm pretty sure all they're going to do is dilute it with hot water. To leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is PERFECTION. Extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare."

But after their meal at Monta, not many positive reviews stem from their experience they had. Honestly, if you're going have that reputation as \"Best of\", people will hold you to a higher standard.\n\nI would say the service here is good: the servers are friendly, the food comes out fast, generally a clean restaurant, and the wait is not too long (30 mins during busy times). The kitchen is open with a bar counter for customers to see their food being made. \n\nOnto the food, and the reason why this is given only three stars. It is unfortunate to say that Monta's food is only standard. You can find this kind of quality ramen at any restaurant that is dedicated to making only ramen. The broth is good, but other ramen places in Vegas can and have achieved the same results. The toppings are what you'll find at other ramen shops: butter, nori, chasiu, canned corn, green onion etc etc. \n\nI will say that i do stop by Monta frequently for a bowl of ramen, however I would not make this a destination restaurant. There are other ramen houses in Las Vegas that are producing at the same level."

Both had thick and rich pork based broth with thin, unrisen noodles. The fried rice was well mannered with excellent seasoning & the gyoza was surprisingly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. \nService was o-kay ....most likey because it was super busy with only two waitresses on the floor.

I'm a patient guy and I was here too, but reality is that deep down inside I wanted to just go.\n\nI order the Spicy Tonkatsu.I mixed things in, I ordered an egg for it and digged in. I ate, and I ate and I could just not get any flavor from the other ingredients. The only thing I tasted was the noodles and the very thick broth. As far as spiciness... there was none. Not one single sweat came down, not one single sniff of spiciness, just a whole lot of disappointment. The broth was too strong and took all the flavor from everything else. It was not warm enough. My friends bowl had more noodles than mine, he did not order extra. The noodles just felt present. Not really much of an impact there. The meat just dissolved and I didn't even feel anything because of the broth. If I at least had more noddles I would have just enjoyed slurping them more.\n\nMy friend had some Gyoza and those were real good! But again thats something I did not order. I did not eat it fast, the bowl just ended quick. I still feel disappointed writing this now. Between the hype, the atmosphere and the awards hanging I was expecting more. My friend ordered the regular Tonkatsu and said it was great. We both agreed though that we have tasted better around Las Vegas. So I may come back, but not for a long time cause I don't want to feel disappointed again, or feel like a sucker. Price is fine for Ramen I don't mind that anywhere. To give you a sense of how it feels today... It's like when you break up with your lover only to go back and be treated like crap and being told, \"I told you so\". Just for me... when it comes to Ramen I want to feel happy to some extent.\n\nI am so glad my first Ramen bowl, I have ever had, was at Aki Matsuri back in 2014 where a restaurant from Japan came in just to sell Ramen for the festival. After that experience, I hold these places, especially this one with awards, with high regard. Sucks, I was really looking forward to this place. *sigh* :/"

Their menu is small and simple, which I like because then I don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one I want to order. I was able to see what they have and decide what I wanted quickly. We ordered the Tonkatu Shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy! We also ordered their fried rice and gyoza. All was delicious. \n\nThe only downfall I have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside. (No inside seating area, hardly)\n\nIt was definitely worth the wait for us though. We enjoyed eating here and will be back again for sure."

Four stars as while I've no complaints on the food, and they also have a liquor liscence which is cool, the restaurant only seats about 24 so if you want to eat, be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes when the place is full (and it always is).  If you get there about 5 minutes before it opens you'll be able to get a seat; getting your bill is also a bit of a challenge but overall a great experience.

Ramen noodles, with different bases, toppings to add and gyoza and fried rice are a must also. Enjoy! I come here often and have been coming here since they opened.

The soup for the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen was a little bit salty, but the pork was the best thing ever. Wow, it is so tender and tasty, totally worth it- just don't finish the soup. I wish there were more pieces in my ramen, but you can always add more! Also, as recommended by our waitress, the Takana friend rice is a must. It was really delicious and I wish my stomach would have let me eat more. \n\nOverall, Monta Ramen is a cute little ramen place in the Chinatown/ asia food area off the strip. The food is decent, great for hangovers and the service is also really friendly. Although where we sat is spacious, this place gets super packed. Prepare yourself for a wait because the restaurant is small and can only accommodate a few tables / seating at the bar at a time."

Hey, that's the perfect description of our waitress!\n\nWe arrived on Friday night, between 6-7PM to a full parking lot, but a slow night over at Monta Ramen. We found street parking, got our name on the list and probably sat around 7 minutes after that. The bar top was packed while the main area had a steady flow of patrons ordering, dining, enjoying then leaving. Seems like standard operating procedures, so let's do it.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Tonkutsu Ramen and our table shared the Takana Rice. Literally, our ramen showed up within minutes.. Seems like they might have it sitting stove top somewhere. It took longer for our rice to show up, but it was definitely worth it. The rice was tasty, as are most fried foods. Fluffy and moist with bits and pieces of meat, egg and dashes of spice. \n\nAs far as the ramen goes, there was a taste I can't quite describe.. it wasn't necessarily bad nor was it good. What saved the bowl, in my opinion, was the fact that they include a little sriracha style chili sauce which blended well in the broth and masked that indescribable taste. That, along with garlic and a dab of soy totally turned this dish from a 3 to a 4. The spice level, out of 10, had to be in the 5 or 6 zone. ALMOST had me, but it was more of a flavor than the actual kick. The ramen noodles were a little thin making it truly easy to finish this bowl off, which I find hard to do in the SGV area due to the portion sizes.\n\nThis wasn't necessarily the best ramen I've had to date, but having the wind gust hard outside along with winter like temps and an empty stomach, it definitely did the job.. We didn't have to wait in a dreaded line, super-friendly service, decent prices, prompt ticket turnaround times and the meal was quite fulfilling."

            "review": "Every bowl of ramen comes with two slices of pork chashu, green onions, kikurage (black mushroom), and bamboo shoots. There are four different types of broths:\n\n1. Shoyu- Soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average\n\n2. Miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill miso ramen\n\n3. Tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. The soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. Some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. If you're not a fan of a thick soup, I would skip this one. Definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.\n\n4. Tonkotsu-Shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. The shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. This is definitely Monta's signature ramen and a must try.\n\nAdditional Toppings: Some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.\n\nAdditional Notes: \n*If you order extra noodles (Kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. It's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning. \n* There are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to Chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). I definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy. \n*There is a $10 minimum on credit cards. Bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that.\n*They will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.\n\nOverall:\n\nSo far, Monta has the best ramen in Vegas. (Still need to try Anime Ramen, and Fukumimi though.) It's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up. \n\nService varies depending on how busy they are. Bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. Seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours. \n\nThe consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. Sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. Also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. Once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. These hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. Portions are decent sized for a regular person. If you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share fried rice (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.\n\nOverall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, Monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists."

I am a HUGE ramen fanatic so I would certainly recommend coming here for a bowl of noodle soup or their excellent fried rice; however, do not let the prices on the menu deceive you! It only APPEARS like you are eating a quality meal for cheap; however, if you upgrade your food to the way you want it (extra noodles, toppings, etc.), it actually comes out to more $$ than you'd expect to pay for a ramen place. The bill came out to almost $40 between 3 people, which for a ramen place is HUGE! \n\nThe service was below mediocre. They weren't attentive and they kept forgetting to bring some essentials... like water, soft drink, etc.. We did not go at a busy time, so unfortunately they had no excuse. \n\nMy friend keeps wanting to go back for their fried rice and I wouldn't mind going back to try a different bowl of ramen either :). Just don't go here thinking you'll have the best ramen and service in town from of all the other yelp and magazine reviews, because then you will end up being disappointed like me... Just come here hoping to have some good food and if you have a large appetite, be prepared to spend extra $$ than you expected."

It's pretty much marinated bacon, how can you go wrong? The ramen was very tasty and I was finished before I knew it.

You could tell the noodles were \"wendy's\", fresh not frozen, and the garnish were all nicely cooked.  The pork was so tender and fatty and delicious.  You could eat that all day fa sho. \n\nWe also tried the fried rice and the gyoza.  Gyoza is top notch, some of the best i've ever had and I had some Godly ones in japan..  The fried rice was pretty delicious as well.\n\nI really liked my experience here.  The waitresses seemed to be imported straight from Japan, very hospitable and nice.  The food was excellent.

I had a sip of the broth and it was pretty good.  If you want a healthier choice, the Shoyu would be the one to go with.  We also ordered one Mini Mentaiko bowl but didn't even touch it because we were so full.  But later tried it and the eggs were way too salty.  \n\nFor 3 bowls of ramen and the mentaiko, our total was about $24 without tip.  It was very reasonable.  The service was very fast.

Also, even though it's a small place, it didn't feel cramped or stuffy. You had the choice of sitting at the bar or at a table - which made for a very chill eating experience. \n\nI ordered the Gypza to start, set the stage for a wonderful meal. Then ordered the Shoyu Ramen which has both chicken and pork broth, thick noodles, pork belly, mushrooms and egg (extra). The ratio of noodle to broth was perfect and all ingredients complimented each other very well. The broth wasn't salty at all either - which was great! \n\nMy go to spot whenever I'm in town, hands down!"

The menu consists of 4 simple but very different ramen bowls and a few add ons and very minimal side dishes. But so much easier to choose from.\n\nLove the Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen. I order mine with thick noodles instead which are seeped in pork AND chicken broth. DOUBLE the flavor. I make sure to always order extra chasyu (pork) although all ramen bowls come with 2 slices.\n\nLove the slurp of the noodles and melt in your mouth pork.

Dip it in some vinegar and soy sauce and you're good to go! (5/5)\n\n2) Pork Belly Bowl - We got a small bowl to share and OHMYGERD IT'S SO GOOD. Definitely try this. You'll have a hard time sharing it so just get a bowl for yourself haha (5/5)\n\n3) Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen - Broth was flavorful and noodles were good too. Just be aware that basic toppings come with just mushroom, bamboo and pork chashu with green onions. If you want an egg, you'll need to pay extra. (5/5)\n\n4) Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil - I love the broth! The black garlic was oh so yummy. The noodles were cooked perfectly, texture was great. What I especially like about both our ramen bowls was the quality of the chashu. It literally MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.

The Tonkatsu gave the broth the fatty rich taste, and the shoyu gave it a bit more kick in the flavor. For the marinated half-boiled egg (Ntamago), you have to order on the side, which is super worth it if you like them!

(I was parking for goodness sake.)  People were starting to line up outside the door, it's such a tiny place.  We both ordered to tonkatsu ramen, mine with butter and corn, which added to the rich broth.  I keep forgetting to tell them to hold the bamboo shoots.  The chashu was tasty, but just a bit on the chewy side and it's worthy of a youtube video to see me try to separate it with my hashi or do the bite and yank technique while slurping the noodles and broth.  Fun experience pretending we were in a Japan noodle house. We'll go back to try a different broth and see if the chashu is more tender earlier in the day."

I actually joined yelp  just to write a review. \n\nI travel very frequently & always try to seek out the best Ramen / noodle houses in the cities I visit often as I'm a noodle junkie. I don't know why it took me so long to find Monta, though I'm really happy I did as I'm in Vegas every other week. \n\nFirstly, the greeting and staff are extremely friendly - which really surprised me in a positive way considering Monta is located in Chinese town (an area I typically expect to be underwhelmed by service). Very attentive and happy - I left in such a better mood than I arrived!\n\nI sat at the comfortable wooden bar & ordered the Miso Ramen with extra chashu. It was nice to watch the 2 cooks prepare the bowls ordered before mine as it was immediately clear that they were dedicated to the quality of preparation, ingredients and timing to ensure their guests received a perfect serving. In between orders I watched one cook prep and truss the pork for slow roasting & was impressed with the skill.\n\nMy bowl arrived as a perfect portion & nicely presented. I only added a dash or two of the toasted sesame seeds & a dash of the chili powder that were part of a good array of seasonings available to personalize the noodles to your taste. I like that.\n\nThe broth was truly wonderful: rich and creamy while carrying a fresh pork flavor. Noodles were nicely cooked, although a little thinner than I find my favorite to be (Santouka still purveys the finest noodle I have come across). The definite star of the bowl were the delicate and chashu slices that pinch perfectly into the grip of the chopsticks! The flavor, texture, and quality of this moist pork is truly superb.\n\nSuffice to say that Monta has immediately become a favorite here in Vegas; a city where the experience usually fails to measure up to the hype.\n\nEnjoy."

We came to this place like 40 minutes before it opened, and there was ALREADY A LINE. This being said, I HIGHLY recommend coming early & waiting, unless you want to be in the hot Las Vegas sun, grumpy, hungry, hungover and sweaty. \n\n3. The ramen\nI ordered the new spicy tonkatsu ramen with an egg. It was SO GOOD! The broth was very flavorful and not too salty (although, I've been told that I have a salty palette.. to each his own.). The pork in the ramen was soft and melted in my mouth! My only regret is not getting extra. My boyfriend got the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with fat noodles, which was good, but definitely not as good as mine... I think his was TOO salty for my taste (which again, has been known to be on the salty side). Even thought my ramen was overall really good, I couldn't finish it because it felt way too heavy/greasy in my stomach. I actually ended up with a small stomach ache after. \n\n4. The service\nOkay, I guess I have to cut some slack here, because there were only 2 workers manning the floor, but it took FOREVER to order/flag someone down... it kind of felt like they were ignoring us on purpose at first. Nobody likes to have to compete for attention! #middlechildsyndrome #i'mnotevenamiddlechild #yelpdoesntevendohashtags\n\n5. The value\nSUPER CHEAP! Also, a coke was only ONE DOLLAH! To me, that seems unheard of in a restaurant... \n\nAll in all, I recommend it. If you're like me and you easily get stomach aches from food that is too heavy, buttery or greasy, I'd recommend getting a coke or a sprite with your ramen so that you can burp all out alll dat ish."

I got my usual, shoyu ramen without meat, and was not disappointed.  Their noodles were not too cooked, which is just to my liking.  Also, I thought the broth was pretty tasty.  I had no idea, though, how tiny the place is!  We got there just a few minutes after opening, and all the tables were already taken.  We had to sit on bar stools which was a little bit uncomfortable, especially since I was wearing a short dress on the hot day we went.  Business was pretty steady at lunch time - tables/bar stools did not stay empty for very long at all.  And it seemed like everyone ordered their fried rice - maybe I missed out on something?"

It is Osaka style stringy ramen, swimming happily in a savory white Tonkotsu (Pork Bone) broth, not to be confuse with Tonkatsu (Pork Cutlet).  It is created from slow roasted pork bones. You can add sides such as corn, butter, pickled vegetables.  I asked for the roasted chastu pork, medium boiled egg and nori.  The roasted pork melts into the broth creating a symphony in your mouth and the egg was cook to perfection with the yolk still bright orange.\n\nThis is definitely a place where I will come back again but it is like a typical ramen shop.  One thing I have to add is that, they do not serve very large portions, so if you're hungry be sure to get an appetizer.  Sits 20 people, the open at 11:30am and full house by 12:30.  Service was friendly and menu is basic and simple."

The wait staff is well trained and are very alert to what is taking place around the restaurant.  Unfortunately, the ramen is not up to par.  Instead of a slightly thicker and more al dente bowl of noodles, my was softer and more closely resembled the thinner egg noodles one might find in Cantonese soup noodle entrees. The noodles lacked \"bite\" and did not create much of the \"slurping factor\".  It is really too bad because the broth was decent.  The pork belly was good and the other ingredients were good.  The main attraction, however, was a bit \"flat\".  I did not feel going to the restaurant was worth the close to $30 round trip taxi fair I paid to/from my hotel.

The first few bites I thought were delicious.  Then the saltiness became a little too much for me.  I couldn't eat it all, and took about half of it home in a to-go container.  I had the rest the next day, and again, it was tasty but way too salty.  And I usually love salt.  I still ate it though.  Someone else in my party ordered the kuro ramen and loved it.

Monta offers perfectly balanced side dishes (fried rice, gyoza, etc) and options to upgrade ramen dishes.

(* + 1) I'm no ramen expert but I believe the best places have distinctive flavors for their broths. At Monta, you can definitely tell the Miso from the Tonkatsu, and the Shoyu from the Tonkatsu-Shoyu which earns a star. ( * + 1) \n\nLocation+Atmosphere: It's tucked away in a shady strip mall which I always seem to pass, but a good landmark is the bar at the beginning of the mall called Kilroy's (named after the famous Kilroy graffiti). I love the atmosphere which is an open kitchen where you see the chefs work. The bar seating has nice spinning bar stools and it's easy to get comfy/friendly with the strangers next to you. (* + 1)\n\nService: At the door they don't really care who you are or what you do (whether you have a party of one or a party of 10, no special treatment; no forgiveness for leaving/having incomplete party). Once seated, the service is quick and they get your stuff out as soon as possible to get another butt in your chair. With a small party (2-3) the wait shouldn't be too long. With a large (+4) party, at munch-time you're out of luck. Service does not earn a star.\n\nFood: Ramen (why would you get anything else here?). Four different broths to choose from with their own noodle style. Tonkatsu shoyu ramen comes with wavy noodles and the Miso came with thin noodles. Extra noodles are $1.25. I don't get add-ons because there's no need, the amounts which are portioned should be rich enough to keep you from wanting for a couple hours. Which leads me to portion size. First time it came, I thought I could eat 3 bowls, but after the first tasty, rich bowl you find yourself satisfied. What you're looking for is the flavor of the broth and I think this place has one of the tastiest broths. I like to add the spicy powder, hot oil, and sesame seeds so maybe that's why it gets salty near the bottom, but it makes my noodles tastier. (* + 1) Got the gyoza, tasted the gyoza, enjoyed the gyoza, did not write home about the gyoza.\n\nStrangest thing: I do not understand why they don't serve hot tea. Too much work to serve and too little space for the cups? They do have canned oolong and green tea though."

When my order came there was an obscene amount of black garlic oil resembling black sesame paste. This definitely did not look like the picture as advertised. The picture definitely did not have this much black garlic oil in the bowl.  In my bowl the tonkatsu broth was hiding under a layer of black oil. I was puzzled at why there was an excessive amount of garlic oil but I figured I should try it before I say anything else. Once I tried a spoonful of soup I wasn't sure what to think. To me the black garlic oil overwhelmed the tonkatsu flavor and was also quite salty. All I could taste was the garlic oil. Upon finishing my bowl I started feeling quite parched from the saltiness of the broth. Maybe I just went on an off day? If you do order the black garlic oil ramen proceed with caution as it may not turn out like the nice picture as advertised."

I didn't do this, but you could probably ask for the thicker noodle + the tonkatsu broth! \n\nTry to go early to avoid lines!

As I pulled into the parking lot a bum approached the front of my car and stopped me, he asked me to roll down my window, I could smell the alcohol coming off his breath mixed with the smell of unwashed body... after explaining to me that he \"wasn't lying and telling the truth\" and needed three dollars to get on a bus to take his \"kid' (pointing at a wall where no one was) home I told him I had no cash... after staring at me for a moment deciding what to do about that I cut him off and told him to have a good day and good luck... and then proceeded to try to find a new parking spot as someone went around me and took the good parking spot that I was aiming for before I was approached by said bum!......\n\nI have read reviews and you really don't understand how small this place is from reading them. the size of the bedroom... I mean... their dining area... is smaller then the size of my master bedroom.... You could not fit two king sized beds in the main dining room area. after getting over that shock, I signed in and proceeded to wait. after about 20 minutes four people from the bar area left and I was seated...\n\nNow I'm a bigger dude. I push about 290 on a good day and the stool i was on was uncomfortable and flimsy but for some miracle it didn't break!\n\nI ordered a mini Mentaiko and a Tonkotsu Ramen. The Mentaiko was actually very tasty, those eggs do give a good spicy kick, but once I mixed everything up with the rice and added some soy sauce it wasn't long before it was gone.\n\nThe Ramen was flavorful , I added more chashu pork, nitamago (hard boiled egg) and nori to the bowl when I ordered. The broth had a ton of flavor to it. I really did like it. however, I noticed that the noodles are pre-packaged and did not have any sustenance to them they were a little bit of a let down and I wasn't really into them but they didn't take away from, nor add anything of value to the soup broth itself. \n\nThe Chashu Pork was melt in your mouth good. I don't think it was worth the extra 2.95 for the extra two paper thin slices though. however, the extra cost for the 1.50 for the egg was definitely worth it and to be honest, the server I had was actually really nice and she worked really hard to make sure everyone was happy which I really liked to see. after paying in cash...  I ended up getting most of it to go and I just finished the last bit of it while writing this review... (for some reason after re-heating it actually tastes more flavorful! that's kinda odd)...\n\nI would recommend giving Monta at least a try... it's not spectacularly good but it's good enough that I'd come back and try some of the other broths.. I have been to Ichiza for Ramen too. (just up the road from this place heading east) and if I had to compare the both I'd say that Monta comes out on top in terms of the quality of the broth... if I could get Monta Broth with Ichiza Noodles it'd probably be the perfect bowl of Ramen.\n\nI've subtracted 1 star for just how small this place is and the fact that if you go by yourself you'll pretty much be forced to sit on the uncomfortable stools that promise either a fun trip to the ground if they break or a sore ass by the time you're done. I also subtracted 1 star because I didn't particularly care for their noodles.\n\nWhen you go, hopefully you won't be accosted by the homeless in the area, seems to be a lot of them hanging out around popular places trying to find \"bus fare\""

In addition to the traditional Japanese greeting by the staff as you come in and an open kitchen view of the chefs preparing the food, what struck me was the significant number of older Japanese business men who had come in with their suits folded against their shoulders on a blistering hot summer day to order a steaming bowl of noodles!  That clued me in this was perhaps the real deal.\n\nBeing my first time here, I went with the Tonkatsu ramen, which is ramen in pork broth stewed for several hours.  Bonus points for speed since I could have sworn my entree arrived within 2 minutes from the time I ordered.  Step one is tasting the broth:  the broth was at once unctuous and velvety smooth with intense flavors of marrow and porkified goodness without seeming overtly greasy/oily.  \n\nMoving onto the noodles, there should definitely be some spring when you chew on the noodles and these were definitely on par with the other places I've visited with just the right amount of \"al dente\" and some umami embedded within the noodles themselves.  \n\nFinally there's the pork which is marinated in soy and cut paper thin with a thin lining of fat that has condensed into a perfect strip of pork belly perfection that is just right for the creamy broth it is bathed in since any more would cause the pork to loose it's distinct note.  The basic order also includes some bamboo shoots and kikurage (japanese seaweed) and it is a steal of a deal at 6.99, but I think what would have completed my experience was the addition of a few toppings such spring onions or mustard greens (for a few bucks more) to cut through the richness of the broth and add some additional textures and color.  There is also the option to add a hard-boiled egg or to get an extra serving of noodles if you're needing something more substantial.\n\nAll in all, definitely an authentic joint that measures up to the greats and will be somewhere I will frequent again and again especially during the colder months."

Tonkotsu appears to be their most popular offering and bowls start at a reasonable $6.95.  Each bowl comes with two pieces of chashu, green onions, and some bamboo shoots.  \n\nOverall, the bowls are on the small side and toppings a bit sparse than other top places I've frequented.  Corn, butter, Kim Chee, and a hard boiled, not soft boiled, egg can be added.  \n\nBroth flavor was good though a tad salty and one noted compared to the more complex broths I love at Santouka.   The noodles are fresh but thin reminding me of the fresh made noodles at Maru Ichi in the Bay Area. I personally like thicker noodles like Orenchi in Sunnyvale.\n\nService, due to the small space and crowds, can feel a bit rushed and they initially forgot our drink orders.  No biggie and quickly fixed.  \n\nMonta is a nice addition to the ramen scene but with minimally topped bowls and solid broths, ramen aficionados will likely have tried more polished ramen parlors in SoCal and NorCal.  \n\nMonta doesn't accept credit cards and is cash only."

So the next time I went to Vegas, I decided to try this place out cause I love good ramen. Line here sucks but it is well worth it. The first time I had this place I was blown away at how scrumdidilumpcious. I decided to go back to this place again the next day just so my friends can try it out also. Miso ramen was excellent. The pork was so tender that it melts in your mouth. Same with the egg. The only thing I would complain about is the gyoza. They tasted like the one you brought in the frozen good section at the store. Stay away from the gyoza and you would definitely give this place 5 stars."

            "review": "It is hard to believe that over two years ago Monta came into the land of Las Vegas and took us by storm. A small restaurant that mainly focused on ramen with decor that was similar to that in anime, UNHEARD OF. I was blinded by Monta's kool-aid. However years later now and most likely because of the raging success Monta has on the Vegas valley, ramen proprietors came from the shadows and declared Vegas ready for legitimate ramen. For me a cause and effect of the boom is that Monta has fallen in the ranks of preference and not only because of taste, but from the swarm of different styles of ramen that became available. \n\nSure Monta is not what it used to be pre-2012, but it is consistently now what it is. For myself it overwhelmingly salty, thin, and a lack of depth. That might not be the same for everyone, as I know that some of my friends do not particularly enjoy the thick rich broth from other providers. The chashu is more fat than anything else. Monta also consist of ridiculously long wait times, its insane to wait anything more than 15 minutes when a handful of options are only a 5 minute drive away. \n\nAlthough this may seem like a bash on Monta, I think that everyone should try it at least once (when the wait is not ridiculous), sort of paying tribute to Monta because without it, we (Las Vegas) would not have all delicious alternatives. \n\nThanks Monta"

While it is small, it seats more than you'd expect and they also have an L-shaped counter with additional seating when you come in.  Always a good sign when you are greeted warmly, there's a sign-up sheet for waiting, there are kids with their folks, and regulars since the waitresses knew some of them by name. \n\nWe had the tonkatsu ramen and the shoyu ramen, with corn and shredded green onions.  The noodles were perfect, chewy, and the broth was top notch.  We also had the fried rice and the pork belly bowl.  Don't miss these!  And the food does come out fast from the kitchen.  Compared to the bay area, their prices are pretty reasonable and you get plenty to eat.\n\nService was excellent.  If you don't like to wait or are a true vegetarian, probably not the place for you.  We got there at 5:30pm on a Sunday and the place was just 1/2 full.  By 6:00pm, it was packed and they had more than a dozen people waiting.  I'm guessing if there's a line somewhere, it's usually a good bet the place is worth the wait.  It is located in a strip mall so there is parking, but there are also many restaurants as well.  They also called a taxi for us when we were done which was awesome.  I'll be back for sure."

The Spicy Miso Ramen isn't on the menu but since that what I always have, I asked if they were able to make it which they did to perfection.

Recently my Dentist informed me that he had a 3 day conference in LV so I directed him to Monta.  When he came back he told me it was so good that he ate there 6 times in 3 days which means he had lunch and dinner there for 3 days in a row.  If that isn't proof of how totally awesome Monta is then nothing is.  For me it is as good as any I have had the pleasure of enjoying though I do personally consider it the best.  I have nothing against the Ramen in Japan as that is considered the mecca of ramen but Monta seems to have come from a back alley of Tokyo and shines much brighter.  At this very moment I am craving a bowl but just cannot run to Vegas right now but I would if I could because it is that good."

We did have to wait a bit for enough people to clear out to get an appropriate sized table but everyone in my party loved this place. It was perfect for a cold November day.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and if you have any questions about the menu they are really helpful. They have other items on the menu but it's really about the ramen. Also, the price is ridiculously reasonable for the amount of food you're given. $7-$8 for the ramen and $.50-$2.50 for toppings. \n\nI personally always get the Shoyu ramen with Pork topping.

Sure it was hot and humid, but they have large vats of soup and hot water boiling away, so it was to be expected.  I think they had the A/C on full because it was definitely tolerable.  Next was the waitress.  The one that helped me was very friendly and helpful.  She checked up on me regularly.  So good news, maybe the owner read the reviews and critiques on Yelp and decided to do something.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with egg and extra premium green onion.  Since I was the only person in there, my order came quickly.  The size of the bowl was a bit on the small size.  Two, nice, fatty, pieces of pork floated underneath a mound of slivered green onions.  I quickly tried a piece of the char-su.  The meat was extremely tender, as tender as the fat and their was a nice ring of flavor on the outside.  Made me wish they gave me more.  The broth was nice an rich, not too salty and the noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, so they were chewy and adsorbed some of the broth.\n\nAfter sampling everything, I added some minced garlic and chili powder to my bowl.  They also had the pickled ginger, toasted sesame seeds, white pepper, sesame seed oil, and some other condiments so I could season my noodles just the way I wanted.  That was a big plus.  \n\nOverall, I was very happy with the flavor of my tonkotsu ramen, the service, and the A/C.  I would have given this place 4 stars, but the price was a little too steep for the smaller than average sized bowl.  I would definitely go back to take care of any future ramen cravings and try the miso ramen!"

Yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along Spring Mountain Road or otherwise known as \"Chinatown\" in Vegas.\n\nAs you may or may not know it', \"Ramen\" noodles is one of Japanese noodles invented in 1958 by Japan's Nissin Foods. These are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your Asian or Oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). It's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nIt's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my Mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in Vegas. Soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! Ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nWith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"Moshi, moshi!\" in Japanese, which translates to \"Hello\" or rather \"Welcome!\" (I have learned a few Japanese greetings in high school and  having been to Tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). It brought a smile to my lips, I knew I would have a good dining experience. \n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist Japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary Japanese. There are table seatings and bar-like seating available. Menu is simple. Three choices of Ramen noodle soups in \"Tonkotsu Ramen\" (pork bone), \"Shoyu Ramen\" (soy paste), and \"Miso Ramen\" (bean paste). Nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. A list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"Other Dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\nI ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"Tonkatsu Ramen\" Soup. It's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. Topped with green onions, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), I drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. Oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. Surely, the pork melts! Another dish I ordered was the \"Mimi Mentaiko\" which consists of Fish Cod Roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and green onions topped on a bowl of steamed Japanese rice. Very appetizing, a sure favorite! The \"Pork Belly Bowl\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. As usual green tea on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nFunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! I caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.\n\nYes, I left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nIt must have been that I really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that I needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. For a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"Arigato gozaimas!\" (English translation is \"Thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!"

Both my sister and I preferred Ramen Sora's pork and broth over Monta. Their gyoza were decent. They did give us two extra because initially they only gave us five because the chef had dropped the sixth one on the floor so they had to only serve us five at first. If I had to pick, I would pick Ramen Sora over this place. Also, there were a lot of extra charges for toppings while at Ramen Sora they were included in the price.

Even the miso ramen flavors were weak.  Also had the pork belly bowl , I liked the flavors of this dish jus wish the pork was sliced a little thicker.   The one good thing was the bill was only $21 . Service was good.\n        I miss togashi ramen and their mabo tofu ramen :( , well the search goes on for ramen...."

I usually like my noodles a bit firm but I thought their noodles were a bit undercooked.  Their broth was quite thick, but it just tasted too salty and fatty to me. I really needed an iced milk tea after that bowl of ramen. I enjoyed their guitars though. Tasted fresh with thin skin and juicy filling."

If you are not interested in having pork, then don't bother. Definitely wish there some chicken options. The price is great and the flavor is just right. It gets packed, so expect to wait, especially if you are more than two diners. On a warm Vegas night, you can't go wrong with some cold noodles and an ice cold Japanese beer. The gyoza is also pretty delicious and comes out exactly as pictured in the menu...every time! One of my favorite things about this place is the spicy horse radish mustard that comes on the side. It is made in house and unreal. Was not a fan of the pork belly bowl, a little too fatty and more rice than anything, but it looks like a crowd pleaser. They also have some typical Japanese canned beverages. Place is super clean, kitchen is open for all to see, and service is both prompt and courteous."

There was no need to add any additional extras to this as it was good just as it was (although I did add Mustard Greens based on a suggestion from a friend). The place is a small place holding @ max 25-30 people. There was a line waiting outside the door before we were done dining...that's a good sign of any restaurant. Will definitely try it again."

I can't seem to get sick of it, which really needs to happen soon because all this sodium is not condusive to my eating clean and healthy.\n\nI know I said in my Sora review that I probably would not go back to Monta after falling in deep and passionate love with my bowl of ramen at Sora, but I wanted to eat by myself today and I knew if I went to Monta, I could probably get a seat quicker than at Sora since Monta has the counter-top seating.  I used to go to Monta every Saturday for lunch by myself and noticed that there were a lot of people who like to eat there by themselves, which makes it easier and faster for me to get a seat.\n\nToday was so busy!  So busy in fact, that I still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. They only have a couple of servers who also double (triples?) as hostesses and bussers so these ladies are running around like crazy.  Like Sora, I just find myself exremely impressed at how quickly they turn tables over without making you feel rushed when you're eating.  I love to sit at the counter-top and watch them making the ramen.  The guys are super nice and will usually chat a little bit when I've been there on Saturdays, but today he was constantly running around getting those delicious bowls of steaming ramen out of the kitchen.   \n\nAnyway, I don't have anything against Monta.  I just think Sora is way better.  However, I did leave there today feeling extremely happy and satisfied.  I always get the Tonkatsu-Shoyu with chasyu and nitamago.  One bowl of ramen is usually more than enough for me.  If I'm with someone, we will usually also get the gyoza, which are good but nothing special.  Today, however, I decided to try something new and adventurously ordered the kimchi fried rice.  Not sure why regular fried rice comes in a small and large, but add some kimchi to it and you can only get one size, which is a large serving.  But I'm glad I got it because it was freakin' wonderful!  The seasoning is just perfect and the kim chi is just subtle enought that it doesn't overpower the fried rice taste.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!\n\nI still can't help but compare my ramen at Monta to my ramen at Sora, and though it falls short, I still really enjoy Monta as part of my ramen rotation and will continue to go there every once in a while."

My best friend Tida C. is still a die-hard Monta lover so I'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.\n\nThe Miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than I remembered. And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.\n\nA couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.\n\nAnd of course, they still hold true to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. That mini mentaiko bowl is still my favorite app / side dish to a hot bowl of noodles."

The broth is a little bit on the thicker side but not bad ( a tad heavy on the salt). It definitely tastes better if you sprinkle some of the spicy powder on top.

The waitresses and chefs are always welcoming and courteous, and you could tell they put a lot of love and effort in every dish that is served. There are items on the menu that I haven't seen since I lived in Japan, so Monta leaves a very special, nostalgic mark in my heart. They also remember their regulars and treat them like friends. So you'd think the price would match the golden service, but NO! It's so nice and cuddly on my wallet. My wallet wants to date the face off this place.

We flew in to Vegas early afternoon, grabbed our rental, and headed straight to lunch.  We got there a little after 3:30 and was seated immediately.  The servers are all very nice and they move quickly and work very efficiently.  Per my friends recommendation, we both ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with the Nitamago (Kind of like a marinated, perfectly cooked boiled egg) and 2 orders of Gyoza.  The food came out quickly and was piping hot.  We both took our first bites and smiled at each other across the table.  The noodles are interesting and not your typical ramen noodles.  When I first stirred the broth and noodles around, I was thinking that they may be kind of mushy, and too soft.  Nope, they still had a very nice texture to it, and the broth was full of rich deep flavor.  That marinated egg......OMG, so much flavor and cooked absolutely perfectly.  The Chasu, super tender and flavorful.  The gyoza was good, however I usually like it better when the bottom is a touch crispier.  My wife rarely brags about food like I do, but she made sure to let my friend know how good the ramen was and that we had to come back again on our next trip.  Ahh, yah I think we can do that.

All of which come with the basics: chashu (pork slices), bamboo shoots, green onions, and kikurage mushrooms. You have the option to add \"extras\" to personalize your ramen.\n\nI had the tonkatsu-shoyu ramen with a boiled egg (as an extra). In retrospect, I should have ordered extra chashu -- which I recommend you do if you like pork. The meat was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth that the two slices the bowl comes with wasn't nearly enough! The broth was very tasty and not too salty like how some ramen can be.\n\nThey have other side dishes (gyoza, fried rice, etc) but I have a feeling those aren't the reason people come here. They're simply there as fillers. Stick to the star of the place: ramen of course!\n\nThis is definitely the place I will come to to satisfy my ramen cravings that I get once in a while.

Therefore, it's not a good restaurant for a big group celebration (because of the size of restaurant), but if you are looking for an authentic and delicious Ramen, cold noodle or pork belly bowl, this is the place you shouldn't miss when you visit Vegas.\n\nMy favorite is Miso Ramen and pork belly bowl. Some of my friends claimed the miso Ramen was slightly salty, but I disagree with them. The fat of pork belly bowl created this awesome aroma and chewy texture from this simple dish. No matter what I ordered that day, I can't help but always order an extra small pork belly bowl every time I visited."

Therefore, it wasen't as ungodly hot and stifling inside as it was last time.\n\nI ate the whole bowl of ramen AGAIN. I have begun to really grasp just WHAT makes the tonkotsu ramen so good. It's savory and not overly salty. In fact, it's UN-ramen-like in that regard. (OK, i'll admit to normally eating a shoyu-based one many many times) The broth is actually a bit creamy (VERY addictive) and the stuff inside the bowl is tops.\n\nCan I tell you how much IN LOVE with the marinated boiled/almost soft egg in it, AKA nitamago? It's so damn great! If you like hardboiled or softboiled egg, you'll love it I guarantee.\n\nI have to try the fried rice and their gyoza. They smell very very good, but I have to have more people with me to get it all eaten! When the weather cools down, i'm going to be here LOTS!\n\nBTW, they have a VERY funky restroom!"

I loved my shoyu ramen - very flavorful and not as salty as I feared. I spiced it up a bit with the spices on the table. Dining companions tried the gyoza (dumplings) and enjoyed them. Reasonable prices and excellent, speedy service. Small place with very few tables and counter service so arrive early or late,as you will probably have to wait otherwise.  I dined with two big eaters and they were full at the end of the meal, sharing a fried rice a gyoza and each having their own ramen. (Note that the regular-sized fried rice was not as big as expected, but not to be missed)  WARNING: Not many , if any, healthy options on the menu that I saw - so save some calorie real estate for a great dining experience at the casual Monta - well worth it!  I skipped the gyoza, had just a bite of the rice and gave one of my dining companions some of my noodles and still -- I was content!"

Maybe...\n\nMy order I always get is the Tonkotsu Ramen + extra Chashu + Nitamago + Corn\n\nSometimes I order Gyoza, sometimes Fried Rice, sometimes both. Depends on how hungry I am.\n\nEverything is done well and if you need more heat just add chili powder.\n\nWhat sets Monta apart from the rest is their Chashu. I don't really fuck with pork but their Chashu just melts with good buttery & rich flavor. The broth can get heavy but their must be an egg in every Japanese hot noodle dish.\n\nThe spot is like how a ramen spot should be. Limited spacing with more seats at the bar than tables. You get in and get out (if no wait time) in 30 mins...\n\nWhen it comes to Japanese food I'm a harsh critic because the times I've been to Tokyo and my mom's cooking\n\nOverall it's maybe the best in town as I've converted non ramen lovers into lovers of ramen...if you haven't been go for sure!"

Prior to Monta, the only types of ramen I ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually Korean in descent and instant in nature. So I was surprised, in a good way, when I discovered that Japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen I've eaten before. \n\nMy boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so I immediately suggested Monta Noodle House after remembering all the positive reviews on Yelp. We entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. The restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in Japan (at least in my mind). Service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers. \n\nAfter reading over the menu, he ordered the Miso Ramen with extra char siu and a Mini Mentaiko while I ordered the Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen and an order of Gyoza. Here is the breakdown of the food:\n\nGyoza- Hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. Overall, very good and savory. \n\nMiso Ramen- He enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. I tried some of his ramen, and while I preferred the broth of his ramen, I liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. \n\nMini Mentaiko- He enjoyed this as well. I think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. \n\nTonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen- Delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. My only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness I wanted. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed dinner that night. I enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the Japanese ramen world I went again with my mom."

My partner had miso ramen and added nori. We ordered white rice and kimchi to share. The napa cabbage kimchi is fresh and not overly fermented, and my ramen was flavorful and delicious. A pretty good sized bowl too! For all of this (2 bowls of ramen, rice, kimchi, one drink) it cost less than $20 before the tip.

Each grain of rice perfectly seperated from eachother..  \nWith that being said the only 2 turn offs is the price.  althouggh a lot of the pricing is dead on correct.  there are few items on the menu that i feel is over priced for the amount they give.  another thing is the temperture inside the restaurant.  i guess they dont have any ac so they use a fan to cool down the room.  after eating hot soup i started sweating like a horse.  \nOverall I am satisfied with the product and i will be going back to eat again...

All ramen options are pork-based. While not a place for vegetarians, Monta is a great spot for a hangover cure after too much partying. The consensus from my carniovore/omnivore buddies was that the broths were tasty but a tad too salty towards the end. One friend observed a person eating rice on the side with his/her ramen, perhaps a good solution to the saltiness.\n\nBecause I didn't have a non-meat option for soup, I got two bowls of the mentaiko on rice instead. Mentaiko atop rice is nowhere near as tasty as the noodle version. Also, butter seemed to missing from the fish egg mixture. I probably won't order this again if I return. The vegetable gyozas are probably worth trying, though.\n\nService is pretty good for such a fast-paced dining environment; the staff really know how to manage lines and to keep things moving along without being rude or giving you the impression that you were being kicked out. I'd definitely recommend this to any person looking for a soothing soup after a night of endless drinks."

Monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. Don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.\n\nHalf of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. You can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. Though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.\n\nThere are three types of ramen to choose from; Tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); Shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and Miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). The Shoyu and Miso ramen come with chewy, thicker noodles which I much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the Tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). All three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. You can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, Takana, or pickled mustard leaf. These don't cost a lot, so customize away. Also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.\n\nYou won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. Of these I've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and fried rice with takana. The fried rice is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. Another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).\n\nI can't think of any other meal I'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so I plan on going to Monta frequently this winter. If it continues to get even busier, however, I may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. I brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. The noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. Attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men."

The noodles were quite delicious too - it was slightly crispy and went very well with the soup. Tonkatsu comes with two pork pieces. You can order extra sides to put in your ramen (I felt like corn that day), but they do charge you.\nI also had a side order of fried rice, which I thought was very salty.

Oh, and the fried rice is pretty good, too!\n\nThe place has a cozy and traditional feel to it. It's a very small establishment, but this is what you should expect from an authentic Japanese restaurant. This comes with a quick and friendly staff.\n\nNeed to go to this place more often since it's already getting really cold."

My friends have gutter palates & they're not adventurous @ all.\n\nFortunately, I have made new friends & that was how I ended up here. Thanks to Cresta I., I finally got to try Monta. I had accompanied her on a Mommy & me day. I, being the, me in the equation :P\n\nWe arrived a little before 6 pm on a Tuesday. We had actually tried to come around lunch time, which was silly of us, because it was way too packed. However, when we returned, it was less crowded & we were seated immediately at the counter. \n\nI ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with Nitamago & some chicken fried rice. The rice came out first & it was really good. Then, the moment I had been waiting for, and cue the angels...AHHHH...my ramen. It just looked so beautiful & smelled wonderful. As I write this now, my mouth is watering & I can just taste it. It really was so comforting & delicious, the epitome of Umami, in the general sense. I just wanted to dive in and backstroke in there! I was totally reminded of the movie Ramen Girl, and I could just feel the love, and heart & soul that went into this bowl of ramen. Unfortunately, I have nothing else to compare it to. I have been to Japan, but sadly I never had the pleasure of having ramen while I was there :(\n\nOverall, I really love this place & I will definitely be back. The staff is wonderful & gracious. It was a lot of fun sitting @ the counter & watching the cooking going on back there. Lol, I did find it amusing to see some of my fellow Hispanics back there doing big things ;) I'm pretty sure they were trying to pass them off as Japanese by tying their headbands a little tighter than normal though. Well, they do it @ Benihana, so why not here. Ha Ha! I will totally recommend this place to any and everyone who will listen."

I'm sooo sad!) but once I discovered that it was closed, we tried this place on a recommendation from a friend. For me, this was my second attempt at this place because the first time it was packed.

The place was very small and tight, but there was definitely a Japanese feel to it. I ordered the Shoyu ramen with cha shu pork and green onions. Gerald had the same thing but instead of the green onions, he added a soft boiled egg (after I saw his, I wanted an egg too!!!) The service was quick, pleasant and honestly, was what was expected. I was not disappointed. \nAs for my ramen...it was delicious!!! It was the perfect temperature, had just enough flavor and hit the spot!! I only had two disappointments: \n\n1) The limited menu - I enjoyed what I had, but I think I would have liked to see more choices. \n2) Feeling rushed - not by the staff, but by the people who were waiting. They just stood by my table and I felt like they were rushing us because their party was seated right next to me. Not the restaurant's fault, but perhaps they should come up with a seating system or take reservations for large parties or peak periods. \n\nI will definitely try this place again! I give my ramen 4 stars, but until I try something else on their menu, I'll stick with my 3. Yummy ramen if you're craving it!"

We ordered the tonkotsu ramen with a boiled egg on the side and were very impressed at how delicious the bowl of soup was. Although the bowl only comes with two thin slices of pork, the pork itself is very tender and is soaked in that delicious broth making you savor each bite! The broth is cloudy like it should be and wasn't too salty or too bland for my taste. What really impressed me was the poached egg. The article talked about how perfectly poached the eggs were there and boy was he right! The egg was not too runny nor too cooked. The combination of the runny yolk and broth tasted like heaven in my mouth! \n\nOverall, the food and service were excellent. It was also a very authentic experience for me since the worker's demeanor reminded me of my time in Japan. Very perky, always smiling and had a cute high pitched voice! Come here to enjoy a delicious bowl of ramen and experience a little taste of Japan!"

There tables are only made to seat 4 at most, and even though there was an empty table and the one next to it had just paid and was ready to leave, instead of waiting 5 minutes and seating us THEY SAT THE EMPTY TABLE. After we had already been WAITING FOR 45 MINUTES, they again wanted us to wait for two tables to clear out at the same time. Not gonna lie, I lost my s***.  Then, to try and make it up to us they tried to offer us bar seats (after I made it perfectly clear in the beginning that we wanted a table) and we just picked up and left. Apparently bringing more than 4 people and asking for a table is too complicated for the waitresses to handle and caused their brains to melt.\n\nOther than that, I have never had a problem with their service there and their ramen is the best I have ever had. Even my half Japanese cousin (who is from Tokyo) said that it's the closest to Japanese ramen you can get in the states. It's always crowded now (a testament to how good it is) so be prepared to wait. But the wait is usually not too long since they get people in and out as fast as they can.\n\nIn conclution: Never arrive in a group of more than 4 people (or you will overload the poor waitresses' brains, heaven forbid) and you will have a fabulous dinner. :)"

The broth was absolutely delicious--just the right amount of flavor and rich pork fatty goodness to make it taste perfect!  Even though it was 103 degrees outside, I didn't care.  I ate and drank the entire bowl clean.  Gluttony at its finest.  Woo!  I was extremely impressed with the quality and texture of their chashu.  It was marinated just right and they really did cook it for hours to get it to really melt in my mouth!  The moment I bit into a piece, I didn't even really have to chew at all...it immediately disintegrated into orgasmic morsels of ecstasy and rocked a party in my mouth!  The egg was perfection...just the way all ramen \"hard-boiled\" (I still think they should call them \"soft-boiled\"...it just suits the texture better!) eggs should be.  The yolk was nice and and gooey and soft.  It complimented the ramen broth so well!  Needless to say, I wolfed down the entire bowl in about 10 minutes or less. hehe ^_^  \n\nWe also got an order of the regular fried rice, and the only thing I can say is that it is THE BEST Japanese fried rice I have EVER had in my life thus far (in the States).  The rice was so extremely flavorful and light (because too much oil is a no-no).  Sprinkled with those little slices of heaven known as their chashu and plenty of pickled ginger, it tasted PHENOMENAL.  That was the 2nd party that rocked my mouth in one sitting!  Boy, what an awesomely dining experience!\n\nExquisite ramen.  Good price.  Great service.  Will most DEFINITELY have to visit again whenever we're in the area.\n\nOh, and my brother (who doesn't eat pork) also came with us.  He ordered the kimchi (or spicy?) fried rice without the pork and REALLY enjoyed his food.  He was even full off just that one single plate, so their portions are very reasonable, considering the elephant-sized appetite that he has."

I'm sometimes skeptical of restaurants  that become very popular, because the quality can start to decline after a while.  Monta lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe limited menu deserves notation.  Monta offers a two page menu; this is a good thing in my opinion.  They are not trying to offer tons of dishes. They do ramen and they do it well.  Also, the menu describes the different kinds of ramen.  For example, the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen is a pork and chicken broth soup.  Sometimes this white girl is quite confused when it comes to Asian food and little details go a long way.  \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Gyoza ($5.15).  These little nuggets of pork and vegetable were delicious.  The outside was crispy and chewy at the same time.  I didn't use any condiments, but they have soy sauce and what not on each table.  We both had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen (6.95).  My girlfriend added nori for an extra $0 .75.  I scarfed down that bowl of soup in record time!  I couldn't get enough.  It was salty, but not too salty.  The noodles were chewy and the pork was perfectly cooked.  It was topped off with green onions, two slices of chashu (pork), bamboo shoots and kikurage (whatever that is).  I washed it all down with a glass of Asahi beer ($2.95). \n\nThis place only seats about 28 people and I know it's a popular spot.  Thankfully when I visited there wasn't a line out the door.  I'd be happy to wait next time though, now that I checked the hype and agree with the others.  Monta is definitely worth visiting."

The menu is very simple...pick your broth (tonkotsu, shoyu or miso) and then you are off. The food made it to the table fast, but was not impressed by the flavor nor having to pay per item to make my bowl complete.\n\nso needles to say i would recommend you try it and put your comments up to let people know what to expect before going there. NO one in my party was floored by the flavor and the wait staff was very slow at refilling"

So I'm definitely picky (in everything). We waited about an hour, it's a small shop. Our waiter was very nice and our food didn't take long. But oh my, my mouth is watering just typing this. The fried rice was flavorful and oishii! I didn't try the kimichi fried rice I was scared it would be too spicy for me but I'll try it next time because it looked so good at other tables. The gyoza was soft boiled it was yummy too. Now the ramen, I've never had thin noodles before and it changed my world. It really complimented eveything. The broth was hearty but not super so I was able to finish everything. The egg was melting, oozing, you know good stuff. Chashu mmmmmmh. Yeah so go try it out, worth the wait, drive, everything :)"

Yes, I still think service is sometimes a hit or miss, but lately its been great the past few times I've been here. Hopefully, this is just consistent and not my amazing luck. Also, they listened to their customers and opened up a new location in Henderson.

This Monta Ramen hit the spot and made me hungover for more!\n\nAfter a two days of almost non-stop clubbing adventure and drinking for a bachlorette party we were seeking a hangover cure. The throbbing BUM BUM BUM and the dehydration headaches were kicking in from drinking close to 6 bottles of vodka. Of course split amongst 10 girls + the extra 3 bottles of \"blow job shots\" and \"scooby snax shots\" that resided in our hotel. \n\nWe came at 10:30am. They open at 11am and dafuq they had a line already waiting. Of course we were the second party that arrived. However the first party ahead of us only had 2. The total capacity in this small restaurant was probably... 28-32 seats. What I noticed in Las Vegas was... when the restaurant says it opens at a designated time... they sometimes open 10 minutes earlier. This goes to many of the restaurants outside of the strip. I never understood that. Also the patrons here are rude. Another party arrived and tried to CUT INFRONT OF US. To get in. WTF VEGAS? SCUMBAGS NO?\n\nAnyways, the ramen here is comparable to some very phenomenal ramen joints in Japan. The Ramen mecca. It could go head to head to Santouka ramen and probably kick their ass easy.  Broth is rich, not too salty. Meat tender. Noodles perfect. I had opted for the Shoyu Tonkatsu ramen. Because I love soy sauce based ramens. With the combination with the Tonkatsu broth? F yea.  I also love my ramen SPICY. They had a special on that. It was every bit of heaven you could ask for.\n\nNOT TOO SALTY YET RICH. CHECK.\nNOT TOO OILY YET STILL SAVORY. CHECK.\nCUSTOMER SERVICE? Awesome. The lady was lovely. The cooks focused.\n\nWould I drive 4-5 hours to eat this again? Hell yea I would."

As in, if the next table open is can seat 4 people and you're next with a party of 2, you are still the ones to get that table.

But this means you will have to make sure you are present when they call your name, because I am almost certain they will also keep their word that you will be taken off the waiting list with no exceptions.\n\nThe food itself was fantastic. The broth was perfection, thick and flavorful. The noodles are the thin kind, which wasn't a problem for me. My friend got the spicy fish egg with rice side dish and unfortunately hated it. She took two small bites before leaving the rest untouched due to the fact that it was way too salty. \n\nOverall, just don't get in line starving and expecting to get seated immediately, no matter what random hour you arrive.

Like watching the slow death of a once great king, the food quality has seemed to die too.  Over salty broth, oily broth, boiled gyoza, and an appalling meat to rice ratio on their side dishes. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? \n\nTo this I'm sorry Monta... You have lost me. I used to defend you feverishly against other ramen places but now... You have betrayed me. So to all you newbies that rave and praise this \"new\" monta. You can have it. I will leave this place in the past."

Blissful and stuffed, the 2 mile walk back was perfect to burn off all the magnificent calories. \n\nIt is in a little strip mall and is quite crowded no matter the time of day (we were there at 2:30 and waited about 20 minutes)  You write your name down on the clipboard right inside the doorway and when a table is ready they call you.  Most people wait outside, there are a few benches to sit on.\n\nThe interior is very clean, neat, and cute.  There is a counter and a few small tables.   It is not a place you want to come to if you have a large group. \n\nThe service was very pleasant.  The waitstaff was extremely kind, patient, and attentive.  \n\nWe ordered some of the regular fried rice and it was the best we have ever tasted.  It was extremely fresh, well seasoned, and downright delicious.  We also ordered the gyoza which were cooked to order and impeccable. \nOnto the ramen, I ordered the Tonkotsu which is a pork based broth where the bones are cooked in the broth to create a creamy, thick, almost buttery texture.  It was extremely flavorful and very rich.  My husband got the combo Shoyu Tonkotsu which is the same pork broth mixed with a soy/chicken based broth.  This was a little less rich and was also close to perfect.  The noodles were fresh and the perfect texture.  There are tons of add ons and extra seasonings at the table so you can make the broth exactly the way you want it! \n\nI would recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area.  It was amazing."

I have had this place on my bookmarks for a while.\n\nStopped in today for a solo lunch- was seated quick as there was a spare spot open at the bar, but when I first went in there was a wait list. Yes, at 3PM on a Saturday. Plan ahead if you're going with a group!\n\nService was great- two super-sweet ladies were attentive and friendly throughout my visit. Placed my order for the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen, added the egg, nori, and shredded green onion. Initially I was put off by having to add on my favorite ingredients separately, but the silver lining to doing so was that I was able to meet the $10 credit card minimum without buying a separate appetizer.\n\nWhile waiting for my bowl, I was entertained watching the guys in the kitchen making endless batches of noodles. Got my order fairly quick as the restaurant started emptying out a bit.\n\nMy first reaction was one of happy surprise: the steep $1.50 fee for green onion got me a shredded nest of it atop my bowl, an unexpectedly gigantic amount that found itself in every bite I took. In a good way! Found the noodles to be thinner than I prefer but cooked to a perfect al dente. Shredded the nori into small pieces to distribute throughout my bites. The broth lacked the depth that I've had elsewhere, but I was pleasantly surprised to use the brown garlic oil on the table and get a robust improvement in the flavor. Potential new favorite condiment alert!\nSad to note that the chashu was somehow lost among the kicked-up broth and sea of shredded onion. What is usually a highlight of my ramen experience was just mediocre here, the cut I had was not fatty nor was it particularly flavorful either.\n\nI will likely be back because service was great and there are other varieties to try on the menu, but I was slightly underwhelmed by the bowl I got today. Location is everything though, and this noodle house is conveniently located and will likely result in repeat visits."

If it wasn't for that freak storm that swept through the Chinatown area, my boyfriend and I probably wouldn't have found seating at Monta Ramen. Only those who are really serious about ramen will brave flooded intersections for a hot bowl of noodles -- that, or your Plan A for dinner fell through. \n\nI almost didn't want to come here because of the issue I have with the lack of seating at this place, but we took the chance and dropped in anyway. We figured not many people would hit up Monta because the weather was lookin' ominous. Two open spots were free when we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night, but the tiny restaurant was almost filled to maximum occupancy. By the way, if you see seats available, don't forget to put your name down on the sign-in sheet by the doorway; it's still first come, first served. \n\nI stuck with what I ordered on my last visit which was the Tonkotsu Ramen with nori and nitamago. I was pleased to learn that the ramen was still solid like the last time I had it several months ago. The broth was hearty and the pork was tender. I also shared an order of the Mini Pork Belly Bowl.  As much as I enjoyed my ramen, I almost want to say that the pork belly was my favorite part of dinner. It was flavorful and delicious, and I prefer it over the Mini Mentaiko Bowl that I ordered last time.\n\nUnlike other ramen restaurants I've been to, Monta has about four ramen selections to choose from; however, you won't pay over $8.00 for a bowl. Overall, the food here is affordable. Two bowls of ramen and the pork belly came out to a little over $23.00 (without tip.)\n\nBumped up my rating for Monta from a 4 to a 5, all thanks to that Pork Belly Bowl and how the quality of the food has remained consistent."

All of the ramen bowls, try to tempt me, but here's my chopsticks, so feed me maybe?  \n\nYeah this will probably be out of date by the time I hit submit review, but I'll deal with it.   I've been to Monta several times since it opened, and the first 8 or 9 times I stuck with getting various ramen.  Of those my favorite quickly became the Tonkotsu as I really enjoyed the creaminess of it.  I did like the other two as well, but always found myself going back to Tonkotsu.  As a quick aside, I actually found the Tonkotsu-Shoyu to be my least favorite.  The pork was always tender and tasty, and I would almost always get an egg added and I tried most of the other additions as well.   I personally didn't find many of them to be worth the extra cost to add, though I did like the Mustard Leaf on occasion.  \n\nFor an appetizer I had the Gyoza a few times and found them to be very good examples, but not extraordinary at the same time.   Then one day I decided to split a pork belly bowl with a friend as an appetizer.  Game change.   It's seriously all I think about when I think of Monta now.  As much as I enjoyed the Ramen whenever I'd had it, it took a backseat to this dish in my heart and stomach.  Currently saving up for an engagement ring.  Pork Belly Bowl will make a lovely bride.\n\nService is always friendly if a little rushed, and I always thought the overall price was decent.\n\nStill need to try Anime and Sora so no comparison on Ramens unfortunately, but unless they have Pork Belly Bowl on their menu, it might not matter."

            "review": "This place arguably serves the best Ramen in the state of nevada. There's a small restaurant in the city of irving, Texas called Mr Max. This place, if you follow my reviews, serves one of the most authentic Japanese dishes you can find in Dallas. Unfortunately a couple of years ago, the owner of this small restaurant passed away. \nAbout 6 months ago, MON group, based in Las Vegas, decided to take over Mr Max and revived the restaurant, from there onwards, its full house every single day, you can read more about my review of Mr Max when you are free. \nMON group operates several powerhouse Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas, Monta Ramen being one of them. This is a very tiny restaurant, perhaps housing only 30 people at any one time. But what makes this place so special is the Ramen. The Ramen is legendary tasty and 100% authentic. The tiny restaurant is almost like an exact replica of how a Ramen bar in the busy streets of tokyo would be like. Coupled with the hearty greeting of the japanese waiters and waitress, you might think that you have actually stepped into tokyo. \nI've tried every single Ramen on the menu and i can tell you everything IS fantastic. 1500 reviews don't lie and let the pictures paint the story for you. \nDid i mention that their Ramen cost less than 10 bucks a bowl? Dang, if you haven't tried authentic Ramen before, this IS the place to go."

We went with our two daughters, which enabled us to try most of the noodle offerings. \n\nI had the Tonkotsu (not to be confused with TonKAtsu), my husband had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu and the girls both had the Miso. We also shared a pork belly bowl. Everything was spot on delish. The Tonkotsu is the heaviest, richest broth...delicious, but I think I'll wait until the weather cools before ordering it again. The Tonkotsu-Shoyu is a combo of the richer Tonkotsu and the lighter, clearer Shoyu broth. It had the richness from the Tonkotsu, but the Shoyu gave it a delicious brightness. We did not get to try the plain Shoyu as both girls insisted on Miso. The Misi was also very good, but did not out-shine the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. The toppings were perfect...thin slices of ultra tender chasu (pork), strips of mushroom and pickled red ginger (nothing like sushi ginger).\n\nThe Pork Belly Bowl was everything the name suggests. Tender, well seasoned pork belly atop sticky rice. So good. We like to sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds on top.\n\nThe service was fast, friendly and very welcoming. The place is tiny as are most noodle houses you find in Japan. We went at 2:30 in the afternoon and were able to get a table right away. (was almost hoping they'd be packed...forcing us to go to Raku *sigh* my fav, lol)\n\nHeads up! As of June 1st they are offering Hayashi Chuka which is a cold Japanese noodle dish. Perfect for summer. We didn't order it this visit, but will definitely be headed back soon. It is a favorite of ours, but we've only had it in friends' kitchens. They serve canned soft drinks, and our whole family highly recommends you give the Calpico a go. It's tangy, almost reminiscent of the original tangy flavor yogurt at Red Mango or Pinkberry. Very refreshing :)"

While I understand the aim to look like an authentic Japanese ramen shop, they really ought to consider how impractical it is to have a large customer base with only a few seats. We waited in the cold outside for about half and hour, and then were able to squeeze our way inside the door to wait for another 20 minutes or so. There is a wait list that fills up very quickly.\n\nI ordered the miso ramen with an egg, and a side of gyoza. The noodles were perfect but I found the miso broth to be incredibly salty and it overpowered everything. The egg was pre-boiled and probably stored in the fridge because it was cold in the middle. That was disappointing, as I paid over $1 extra for it and the yolk wasn't creamy at all. The gyoza were your typical run of the mill dumplings and tasted like they came from a frozen package rather than \"handmade\" as the menu stated. \n\nOverall, this visit to Monta was a total letdown. I've heard such good things- perhaps we caught the cooks on a bad night?"

I'm talking like elbows to elbows.This might annoy some people, but in a way I found it to be charming and like any standard ramen venues you will find in Japan.  It's as real as it gets, as for the venue at least.  As for the ramen, it gets even better.\n\nI waited about 10-15 minutes, sat down, placed my order and waited for about 10 minutes for the ramen to come out.  Not bad, considering there was a lot people in the restaurant.\n\nThe ramen was so, so tasty.  Not too hot, the noodles were juicy, and the soup was not salty nor sweet.  I have tried Japanese ramen many times in the past, and I notice that the ramen is ruined because the ramen is too salty or there's too many damn vegetables floating around.  Luckily, for the ramen here at Monta, it was all love.  I had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu, and it was pretty damn good.\n\nThe service was speedy, but great nonetheless.  The waitress took our orders, filled our waters, and gave me the check as soon as I asked for it.  All in all, great experience.\n\nI wanna point out that this is a ramen house, so don't expect a variety in their menu.  They have some chicken bowls and gyozas, yeah, but nothing like sushi or whatever.  You won't be wanting it anyway, the ramen steals the show.\n\nPRO: The ramen is great, service is speedy, food comes out quick\nCON: May get a bit crowded, might have to wait 10-30min on peak hours"

            "review": "So I went to Monta twice last week due to them adding two new flavors and I had to try them.  \n\nKuro Ramen:  Kuro means \"black\" for all you japanophiles.  The color comes from them adding Ma-yu (not to be confused with ra-yu), which is sesame oil with roasted garlic which gives it garlic flavor while adding blackish color.  To be quite honest, this ramen was not good at all.  I was expecting a punchy garlic flavor which it had very little of, and the broth....damn....what happened?  It was bland.  It taste as bland as Ramen Shoku's tonkotsu.  I had to believe that they were using a different broth for this ramen as I tasted my daughter's tonkotsu and it was totally different.  I would give it 2 stars.  Pretty crappy ramen if you ask me.  I would NOT recommend it.  \n\nSpicy Tokotsu Ramen:  This is somewhat similar to spicy miso at Ramen Sora in a way tha they just add spicy miso which you can mix to give it a little kick.  The base Tokotsu ramen is identical and I enjoyed the extra spicy kick to the regular rich tonkotsu broth.  It was also moderately spicy (for me), and I liked the fact that the spicy miso was viscous enough that I could adjust the amount of kick I wanted as I didn't want ALL of it.  I would give it solid 4+ stars for it.  \n\nWith all that Monta has done to Las Vegas' ramen scene, I would still give them a 4, even though their new Kuro ramen was a complete failure.  \n\nI'm also finding that ramen chefs of recent has become noticeably hispanic, and ramen noodles seem to be a bit overcooked for my taste.  If I see that the noodle isn't as firm as I like it next time, I will drop them down to 3 stars....watch out Monta...there are some real competitions now."

At good Ramen places, a half hour to 45 minute wait is the norm. They aren't places to linger. They are places to eat and leave.\n\nEarly on a Saturday night, before the huge CES tradeshow, we hoped it would not have a line curling around the block as it did the year before during the trade show. With a little bit of parking \"karma\" we snagged a parking spot as someone else left, signed in and waited.\n\nWe were fortunate. After 20 minutes, we were in. Some Ramen places do a complete \"meal\" with broth, meat, egg, veggies, etc. for about $15 Monta does the \"basic\" with add-ons that comes up to the same price. But that meant you could get what you extras you wanted. More meat, maybe another egg or an extra helping of corn or nori.\n\nI had the Tonkatsu Shoyo broth (pork bones and soy sauce) with extra charsui (fatty pork), stewed egg and nori. Seated at the bar meant we got a ring side view of the cooks: The huge pots of broth at a roiling boil, how they heated the bowls before using them, the finishing of the bowls.\n\nOnce they arrived, we slurped it down - like you are supposed to, before the Ramen sat in the broth too long and the texture changed. Excellent noodles, tasty - very tasty broth, fatty slices of pork and stewed egg with the yolk just a little \"custardy\" - very yum.\n\nDefinitely worth the usual wait - if we were to head back there again."

The charsiu (pork) slices are one of the best parts of the ramen....it only comes with two slices....so make sure you order extra if you like meat :) As for the little extra bottles of goodies on the table....I always add the chili oil, sesame seeds, togarashi (red pepper flakes), and the garlic paste.... pickled ginger is also available but too strong in flavor for my taste.  Also, for the big carb loaders out there...make sure you save some soup at the end...you can request extra noodles for less than $2.  \n\nAlthough the ramen is good relative to Vegas....better than Ichiza, Shuseki, Anime ramen, Yokohama kaigenro...it won't compare to the ramen places like Ipuddo in NYC.\n\nOnly negative notes are that sometimes the broth is too salty...and they want you to eat and go...so you'll have to find somewhere else to hang out after you are in a food coma...my recommendation is to venture over to Wendy's noodle and order the mango tapioca dessert with coconut milk...for a nice finish to lunch. Prices are pretty reasonable around $10 if you add some of the extras listed at the bottom of the menu."

The restaurants in and around the area of this one, usually deliver, on what I mentioned above, that this one is lacking.\n\nAfter waiting to get seated in the small restaurant, we were greeted quickly. What happened next was weird. We waited for almost 20 minutes before a member of the wait staff arrived to take our order. It took entirely too long for simple noodles in heated broth to arrive. It takes me two and a half minutes to make similar noodles and another two minutes to plate everything.\n\nIf you go during the Summer, which is always in Vegas, be ready for heat inside. Like another Yelper has mentioned, due to its size, this place stays hot and has little to no airflow.\n\nFor three people that ordered the standard fair and no beverages, the final bill should not have been anywhere near $40, but that's what I got."

The intimate restaurant reminded me of some ramen places in Japan except they didn't have the vending machine to place your ramen order here. \n\nI really enjoyed their Kura Black Ramen. The broth was very silky and light which I prefer over the thicker broth unless it's cold as hell outside. The garlic chili oil was a very nice touch. The pork was one of the most tender pieces that I've tried in ramen. The pork broke apart so quickly. I was a bit surprised. \n\nI also have to go with my usual pairing of ramen with Gyoza.

The best thing here is the kimchi fried rice and if you like either kimchi or rice or both, you should definitely get this plate! It's flavorful without being overbearing and it adds a nice variety if you're ordering ramen.\n\nThe Pork Belly Bowl was sooo sooo bland. It looks much better than it tasted, and throughout eating my bowl, I kept having to add spice and soy sauce. The chef kept looking at me do so and I felt a bit guilty since I'd think it's pretty offensive that I'm altering his dish as much as I did, but I HAD to. \n\nThe ramen was mediocre and didn't meet its hype. We paid an extra $1 for spicy paste, but still felt like it was lacking. We do live in Los Angeles where there are many fine ramen establishments, so it gave this place a disadvantage as we were comparing what we had had in LA to what was available here the whole time.\n\nThankfully we didn't have to wait or else I would've docked another star off this review."

There is usually at least an hour wait during dinner and lunch time.   They don't take reservations and won't sit you unless all parties are present.  I highly recommend coming during a weekday or early before rush hour.   But even if you had to wait, it's still worth trying for the 1st time.  The food comes out really fast and the servers are not a few feet away.   Monta is very efficient in getting you in and out.  The menu overall is very affordable and what's even better is that the ramen is delicious!   \n\nThe 2 dishes you have to try are Kuro Ramen Black Garlic oil $7.95 and Takana Fried Rice $6.95.  The ramen broth is very rich from a long period of simmering and the noodles comes out chewy just like the way i like it.  If you like roasted garlic, you have to try it.  I found the flavor was even better when you add chili oil.  Eat this ramen fast because the soup gets richer and saltier the longer the soup sits.   It was a bit too salty and thicker for my liking.  But it's still a good ramen that you can't get anywhere else in this world!!!!!  You can also add additional toppings for additional fee if you are feeling adventurous.   The Takana Fried rice is the best rice i have ever had and i want to note that i'm not much of a ricer eater.  But the way they made the fried rice is out of this world.  Its served with chasu pork, mustard vegetables, green onions, eggs and white onions.  I loved the texture with the white and green onions mixed together.  They also give you a side of radish ginger for more enhanced flavoring. \n\nNote: \n1.  They do accept credit card if the bill is over $10.\n2.

Not that Monta is terrible, mind you.  It has plenty of avid fans, my good friend being one; she doesn't like my favorite place at all.  We came here for lunch last week because she loves her some Monta; she comes here so often that the staff knows her order.  We arrived ten minutes before they opened on a Friday morning and there were already 25 people waiting in line!  Monta staff hand out a waiting list for everyone to sign in on, so that's how I know the number.  When we got in the doors, my friend and I plus one other couple were the last to be seated, so capacity in the joint is about 29 people, if my math is correct; this includes sitting at the counter.  We ended up at the counter and that was actually a fun place to be because we got to watch the cooks at work.  We both had the shoyu ramen and I added eggs and corn to mine.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food; I should have ordered an appetizer.  I usually get edamame, but they don't offer it on the menu--weird.  This is a very small space and once it fills up, the line is steady waiting for people to hurry up and eat.

There are so many back in cali but i havent seen any here in vegas until monta.  the place is small and menu is simple. but simple usually means that everything should taste great.  all the stuff i order i really enjoy. you can add extras such as corn, extra meat, etc. to your ramen. they have this new flavor tonkasu-shoyu ramen and that is my favorite.  they make their gyoza fresh and they are really good but expensive considering i can buy a entire bag from the store for the same price.\n\nif you are craving noodles and soup this is a nice change up from pho."

I didn't care because I had to get my ramen fix on, and this place is supposed to be the best in town!\n1st impressions are good; as the wait list was organized and simple. While waiting, I checked out the menu. Straight forward, delicious sounding dishes/ bowls and sides. I also noticed that the menu is more limited than the Monta Ramen in Henderson (Eastern Ave/ Serene). Not full menu of appetizers...\nSo at about 1 pm on a Tuesday afternoon, we waited 10 minutes.  Not bad, but I think we got lucky. I ordered the Tonkotsu...added the egg for a little over a buck...and it didn't disappoint!  The broth was flavorful (not just a sodium bomb) and the noodles were just what you'd expect a good noodle shop would produce.  Did I mention the price? $6.95 for bowl.  So good; and hit the spot for my craving. Check this place out if you yearn for good ramen. You won't be disappointed!!"

The flavors are subtle compared to other places like Fukumimi, Daikokuya, and Men Oh Tokushima. ..and the egg in the ramen is a side option, so if you don't order it you won't get it.  The noodles were really different too.  They didn't seem like they were made from scratch.  Whatever it is, it's not what you typically have in ramen.  Also, the chaysu is pretty fatty so if you're looking to get some meat or protein in, you're almost forced to order something else.. or something else on the side!\n- Gyoza.

As you may all have read the rest of the 400+reviews & counting, everyone is raving about the food at Monta & the prices, and I definitely agree with all the positive reviews, I mean c'mon you have a Menu that would fit in one sheet of paper, how can you mess that one up? They have followed the In N Out Burger's mantra...KISSS (keep it simple st*p*d) Less is More, No Frills, No guess work, in fact I love everything on their menu so much it is so hard for me to pick just one item! The only disadvantage to the \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" attitude is that it GETS BORING, and you might get Monta'd out (especially if you are eating there almost every week sometimes two) I guess some good things must come to an end, and as the Law of Gravity dictates, what comes up, must come down, even if it is THE BEST noodle & chiar su pork in town. With this popularity also comes one downfall....BE PREPARED TO WAIT FOR A TABLE! Especially during the peak hours of lunch & dinner. They open at 11 am and trust me there is a line already forming outside waiting for them to open. this is a sure way to tell that a place is sure to be good especially when it's packed, but what if you are really hungry already??? Hmmm bring some crackers with you. Keep in mind also that at Monta it is first come first serve, you can not make reservations, nor will they seat you if your whole party is not there yet (they FROWN upon this) Monta is suitable for parties of a maximum of 4 if your party is more than that you probably won't sit together or even eat at the same time. The waiting time is often discouraging, HUNGRY PEOPLE are ANGRY PEOPLE! It has happened on more than one occasion that we had to go somewhere else because we got discouraged by the slew of people waiting to be seated anplay how pressed for time we already are. So by now you probably figured out why it is missing that 1 more star, Me & Monta definitely have a Love-Hate relationship. Like in any other relationship, if you fall too quickly, you will fall out as quickly as you fell. So for now or until I crave you again, SAYUNARA Monta-san."

The pork belly was soft but not chewy and very flavorful and the shoyu flavor did not overpower the pork. We added goma to the bowl which gave the pork and rice a rosted, nutty flavor. The potsickers were delicious. The wrapper was thin and crispy and the filling had a slight kick to it, so if you don't enjoy spicy food in anyway I wouldn't recommend ordering these. I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with an egg and was very satisfied with my choice. The broth was creamy without being too fatty and the chashu pork was soft and melted in my mouth. The egg could have used more seasoning or marinated a bit longer as it was rather flavorless.  The noodles were the right consistency and were neither too chewy or starchy. The service was on par with the food. The wait staff was friendly and came back to check on us often."

They also have a variety of side dishes that you can order with your meal. \n\nWhen I go to monta, I usually order a tonkatsu ramen. I like to get thick-wavy noodles instead of thin noodles as well. Ramen usually comes with two pieces of pork chashu, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, and green onions.Their broth is flavorful and thick in a way. I swear it's pretty freaking good. The bowl usually comes pretty fast even if the place may be packed so that's a plus as well. \n\nI also enjoy their pork belly bowl. Their rice to meat portion seems just right to me! And of course, it tastes great!\n\nIf you want to eat at Monta during the night, you have a really high chance of having to wait to be seated.

I always get extra chashu and if I'm lucky I get a piece that isn't 45% jiggly fat, and they're small pieces maybe 2in diameter of thin meat. And to top it off sometimes it's not even a discernible piece but a broken up tiny lump of fat-meat that's supposed to be the last remaining 3 out  of 6 pieces... which surely didn't look like 3 pieces.\n\nOverall I think it's overrated and a little overpriced for the amount of soup/noodles and meat given along with a very \"fat\" tasting meal but hey that's flavor I suppose.

It's probably the good-sized living room w/their kitchen incl'd for the whole place.\n\nTheir menu and selection is straightforward and simple:  3 types of noodle broth and you pick and add the extras you want in there.  Each of the 3 soups come with green onions, two slices of cha siu, bamboo shoots and kikurage.  You pay anywhere from 50 cents to two bucks for addt'l toppings.  They also have gyoza and varieties of fried rice & pork belly bowl - yummm!\n\nI ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with extra helpings of Cha Siu and Nori.  First sip of the broth and ohhh was I in my happy place!  The combination of the tonkatsu pork bone / fat with the Shoyu soy sauce made for a flavorful rich, creamy and salty soup.  I was quite happy that I ordered extra servings of the cha siu.  Let me tell you that was one of the best slices of pork I've ever had.  They simply just melted in my mouth and the taste with the broth made it simply superb for the entire experience.\n\nDefinite must return the next time we're back and I'd give my recommendation to anyone as well.  Expect the long wait and you'll also have to put up with some cramped seating arrangements and limited elbow room - you're not going to get anything more than 5 persons to a table.

We didn't realize the place was sooo small and it was so stuffy upon arrival. \n\nThe pork belly bowl was good, melts in your mouth, but that was where it ended.\n\nOrdered the Tonkotsu, Tonkotsu Shuyo and Kuro Black Garlic Oil Ramen. I have had ramen before, so I am not sure what all the hype is about.  The noodles were ok but the soup was so thick and salty. Isn't it supposed to be a light broth?

Creamy savory broth, perfectly cooked noodle and the tender Chashu (Pork) make it very addictive.  This is not something you can cook at home.  The pork has the perfect amount of fat makes the Ramen rich and flavorful without being greasy.  You can tell it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare the pork.  Their other side dishes (Fried Rice, Gyoza, Pork belly...) are all very delicious as well.  Service was ok and bareable as most of the small scale Asian restaurants. \n\nThe downside of the restaurant:\n--The broth is a bit saltier than I'd prefer.\n--I'd prefer more Chashu (pork) pieces per Ramen order for the price they're charging\n--Sometimes they run out of extra Chashu.\n--It's always hot in there.  They need to invest some money in AC.\n--I felt like I was being ripped off a little when I went there the first time because it seems a little overpriced for the portion and the ingredients.  However, now I'm totally addicted and have no choice cause it's very yummy and they don't have many competitions."

But for some reason, this place just somehow managed to smash that.\n\nI was first taken here on something of a whim.  We were going somewhere else, then the plans changed.  I'll admit, I was definitely not happy about it, as I know that any ramen place has a 90% chance of disappointing me.  But the second I walked in, I was taken aback to the tiny ramen shops back in Japan, with 1 long bar and a few tables.  Immediately my attitude changed for the good.  I looked at the menu, just 3 kinds of ramen, but you really don't need an exotic variety, just the ones you're really good at making.\n\nBeing kinda picky, I had ordered the Miso ramen, but with no mushroom or bamboo shoots, and added an egg and corn.  The soup came, and I did my usual broth test and was very surprised to find it was really good to me.  I added some sesame oil and went to town.  The egg was a nice addition, and the corn just reminded me of the food in Japan.  \n\nI was highly satisfied by the food and the place.  I will definitely be back again."

It's reminiscent of a ramen shop in Japan in the decor, layout, line out the door from the moment it opens, and, most importantly, the taste.\n\nThis place could compete against some of the shops in LA or in San Jose.  And, like most of those places, they specialize in tonkotsu broth.  I had the tonkotsu shoyu, and my friends had the plain tonkotsu.  I'd actually recommend the tonkotsu - not as much going on, and you can taste the purity of the broth, which is quite good.  Not too strong (which is why the shoyu kind of overpowered it), but a little more subtle.  The garlic was at the counter, and I noticed it later, if you want a little more oomph in your broth.\n\nThe nitamago wasn't too strong, but nicely flavored as well.\n\nOverall, a great find that I didn't expect."

The soup has a clean flavor and isn't as kotteri (fatty) as what you find at Santouka (my fave ramen joint). The noodles are also very thin - like angel hair pasta. The chasiu is definitely a standout and meltingly tender. I also ordered a small fried rice and it was delicious and quite literally glistening.\n\nWe came here around 1:30 on Saturday afternoon and scored the last 3 seats at the counter.

It's nothing mind blowing, nor is it terrible, hence the 3stars. \n\nFirst off... Place is SUPER TINY. So expect a wait and make sure to write your name down. Even when it's not packed, it get packed pretty quickly... And because it's so tiny, it tends to get uncomfortable when it's packed... And that's uncomfortable on both the eating and waiting end. Eating coz all the tables are close, even the bar area is hardly comfortable elbow room for the seats next to each other. And also when it's a long wait and you're eating, you seriously feel like EVERYONE waiting is watching you eat to see how much longer you will be sitting down. Uncomfortable on the waiting end coz there's not much of a waiting area at all. If you have issue with confined spaces... Not the place for you my friend. \n\nThe decor and seating does follow the more traditional Japanese ramen house with it being a small narrow restaurant, with wood tables and seatings. I noticed most if not all servers are Japanese so it keeps to the authenticity. Minus the Hispanic cooks lol \n\nThe food is good. Price is definitely what keeps me coming back and dealing with the wait and tight space tho. The taste and flavors aren't mind blowing and it's nothing to rave about to your friends.  But it's definitely somewhere I can easily say \"I got the bill tonight\" without regretting it and feeling like I broke my wallet over a filling meal. I will say the portions are great for the cheap prices. \n\nMy favorite actually is not the ramen here but the pork belly bowl. The pork belly is cooked just right; not over or under cooked and just the right amount of sauce in the right to compliment the flavors of the pork belly. For me... That's the ticket item that has me returning. Plus another good point is service is fairly quick... BUT they have to be... They need their customers revolving in and out to accommodate for lack of space. \n\nTbh the location in Henderson is better. Just this area is closer to my house than Henderson. The ramen can tend to be too salty for my palate... But again like I said it's not amazing but it's not terrible. But definitely worth going for the prices and the pork belly bowl! Nom nom nom"

Don't get me wrong, the ramen is good, but the gyoza was so savory with a very thin wrap fried crispy on one side. The ramen noodles I ordered was the thin ones, which is what I like. I think you can order the thicker noodle if that's your preference. The pork broth was a little on the salty side and was very thick (almost sticky)."

The dining area was small when compared with the other locations, I would limit to group size to 6 below to be comfortably seated.\n\nI got their Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.  The noodles was a bit disappointing, it tasted very mushy like they cooked them, but forgot to put them through a cold bath, and all the flour started to flaked off onto the broth.  Definitely did not look the same as some of the older pictures listed here.  The broth tasted ok in general.  Meat was tender.  Other than that, the ramen did not really had much in it, and having bad noodles pretty much ruined everything in the dish.\n\nService was decent even though they seemed very busy though.  Perhaps they have gone downhill since they first opened?  I might try this place again if they are still open for business during my next trip."

After waiting about 10 more min of not being acknowledged, a waitress finally asked if I was waiting for a party of people, I said no, I just want to order to go.

I sincerely hope other noodle-based places aren't like this, because now I really have motivation to try other ones.\n\nPerhaps to avoid confusion, I should take an asian friend with me to break the barrier a little?

I don't get ramen, but I do get the pork fried rice, which is some of the best I have ever had in my life (and I have lived in the Bay and LA). It's flavorful and rich, and so amazingly priced (~$6?). I could eat it everyday. All my friends love the ramen, so they're obviously doing something right there. They also have pretty great appetizers as well.\n\nBe aware that the sitting room is REALLY small. I think my parent's living room is about the size of the whole space. As a result, there can sometimes be a really long wait. The longest I'm ever willing to wait for cheap food is 30 minutes, and I've waited that long for Monta. But there have been times where my wait has been less than ten minuted on a Friday night. So it really depends on when you get there, and luck honestly. I will say that it is a terrible place for large parties though. It's always been such a hassle coming here with more than four people. If you want to try it out, I would recommend going with only one other person, maximum two, for your first visit. The shorter wait will make your experience much more enjoyable!"

This place is super small so come early or later if you want to avoid the long wait. Their menu is clear and concise.  They don't have dip ramen here.  The reason I liked this one the most was because their broth is super thick and flavorful. I ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen and it comes with chasu, and thin ramen noodles. I usually don't like the spice they add to make it spicy because it detracts from the broth flavor. They said that the spice they put in their spicy tonkotsu ramen is gochugang based ( the Korean spice paste) so it has a sweet note to it. Their ramen price is surprisingly also the cheapest amongst the 4 other places I've tried. My bowl was really satisfying!\n\nIf you're a big eater, they also had rice bowls you can order on the side. My friends got the pork belly bowl and the bowl that starts with a t that comes with pickled cabbage. The pork belly bowl was good. It was just fatty cooked meat and rice. The bowl with the pickled cabbage I didn't like. It was way too salty and it has a strange taste. I think that bowl is an acquired taste."

It used to be my favorite until I noticed that it got a little saltier in the last few months.  So I've switched to regular Tonkotsu.  What sets Monta apart, in my opinion, is the melt-in-your-mouth goodness of the chashu, and the depth of the broth.

Restaurant was pretty small and service was okay.  \n\nMiso ramen with extra chashu porks and nitamago ($7.25 + $2.5 + $1.5) - The miso broth was a bit salty, but at least there was some flavor. Nitamago (flavored egg) was actually pretty good. Chashu porks had a good texture, but tasted a bit salty. I do like their wavy noodle, pretty chewy. \n\nThis place probably won't be this popular if it opens up around the Los Angeles area because there are too many great ramen restaurants.

Monta has thinner noodles, and their broth is very good but doesn't have the umami punch that makes ramen so delicious. I prefer thicker, chewier wavy noodles than thin noodles that they had. They also do not have curry like many ramen places unfortunately, but that is okay, because they make up for it with their variety of fried rices. \n\nI sat at a stool at the bar, and it is pretty uncomfortable, but adds to the ramen-ya feel that they are going for. I wouldn't mind going back, it definitely satisfies the ramen craving, but I think if I had to pick one place it would be Ramen Sora for sure. \n\nCheck it out!"

Anyway, I had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and the Chasu Pork Bowl. \n\nI'm not a food critic in any way but comparing it to Sora, I can notice a lot of differences. One is well Sora doesn't have Tonkotsu Shoyu in the menu. But with Monta's serving I was quite disappointed. The broth felt greasy and almost instantly left a line of fat/grease on my lips. Although it is good, certain people don't like that feeling when eating. It is creamy and rich but Minus points on the grease. The pork on the Ramen Bowl is only one slice hidden behind bamboo shoots and mushrooms. If I didn't dig through the bowl I wouldn't have even found it. The noodles were okay, but it felt like as if they were just about cooked when the chef took it out from the pot. It felt as if it needed about a minute more in cooking. The server was very nice, refilling our water glasses almost every time we downed a glass. So fast it felt like she was on a mission. The Chasu Bowl was very good however, the shredded Nori on top was surprising and the meat was tender and tasty. It was sweet on the outside part of the cut just how Chasu should taste like. I wasn't blown away by the food but it was a good meal for a hungry man like me. I'd give Monta a second try but probably would not be my go-to Ramen joint."

Monta Ramen is literally in the midst of other small Asian food joints in a mini-strip mall in Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.  I honestly would have not known this place existed if my friend didn't tell me  about it.  Parking was, for one, a bit limited.  \n\nI walked in to a small, maybe 6 (or 7?)  tables and the counter bar, stuffy and unventilated ramen joint.  It had the same feel of Daikokuya:  cramped and rushed.  There were people standing, waiting and blocking the door.  I was offered to sit on the bar but there was no elbow room so I stood up and told the lady I would wait for a table instead.  The wait staff are Japanese, but noticed 2 Latinos working behind the bar/kitchen with an Asian guy.  Red flag I thought but then again I saw the framed accolades from different local papers and publications honoring and awarding Monta as the Best or one of the Best in Las Vegas.   \n\nI sat down in one of the small tables and ordered their tonkatsu ramen ($6.95).   The bowls are smaller, I noticed, and they're somewhat stingy with everything, including the broth and the toppings.  I had a couple small slices of chasu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and green onions.  Mine didn't come with marinated boiled egg.  I come to find out that you can order the toppings for extra charge.  Really? for an egg? \n\nThe broth was a bit salty to my liking, heavy and tasted like it was enriched with milk or cream, or maybe miso.  The wavy thinner noodles were somewhat seasoned too, but not overwhelmingly salty.  Their chasu, however, is to die for!  It's perfectly seasoned, cooked, caramelized and charred to my personal standards!  For that alone, I will come back and try their chasu rice bowl.  For their ramen soups?  I might try a different one the next time around, and maybe request thicker noodles.\n\nSidenote:  Monta Ramen was shut down by the Southern Nevada Health Department in mid March 2013 for 47 demerits, but have since re-inspected and reopened."

Initially, I didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places I've been to have impressed me as much as Ramen Dojo in NorCal. Knowing that the capacity of Monta Noodle House fit around 20 or so customers, I anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a Friday afternoon. Arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so COME EARLY to avoid waiting. \n\nMonta Noodle House offers three different kinds of broth but I got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! The standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. I wanted the ultimate ramen experience so I added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - I added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and shredded green onions (MUST add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). I also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! The addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) I have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. I definitely enjoyed this.They also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real GOOD! \n\nIf you're ever craving ramen in Las Vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! It's located in Chinatown so having a rental car is convenient. Solid 4 stars for satisfaction and it's location in VEGAS!!\n\nFYI: I also heard that the kimchee fried rice was also good to try. \n\nHappy Eating =)"

Kimchi fried rice was nothing special and gyoza was mediocre, in fact, a bit burnt.  Only a ~20 persons capacity, so think twice before bringing your party of 10+.  Servers were attentive.

No heaven, no eyes rolling behind my head, no happy ending. Sorry guys. Yelp is normally pretty accurate but these reviewers are having way too much fun and i feel a little bit left out. I thought it was too starchy and salty. It was good but not 5 star great. I did like the flavored egg; it was gooey goodness.  Would i do it again? Probably not. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Perhaps the chef forgot the crack in my soup base. Service was good, ramen was good enough. Try it for yourself.  Maybe you'll get lucky and leave with a happy ending.\nBtw. I did like the kimchi fried rice a lot but the portion was small. Its more of an appetizer. Its pretty good, order one for yourself and don't share because you'll crave for more. I would rate this establishment 3.5 stars."

I once went there straight from the airport after spending a month traveling in South America -- I didn't even drop my suitcase off at home first! This is not a place to linger over a meal, as they try to turn tables quite quickly, but there are plenty of other places nearby where you can get coffee and linger. Fantastic food and very consistent. Limited menu and just some beer and wine, so if you are looking for other items beside miso, some fried rice and some appetizers, I wouldn't choose Monta. However, for the best miso soup in town: Monta all the way. I am so hooked on their food that sometimes I go there twice a week. -- even if I happen to be on the other side of town. Highly recommended."

The sour crunch of the veggies balanced well with the salty, buttery broth. It appealed to my Filipino-taste buds in just the perfect way.\n\nI wasn't overly-stuffed with my meal - I couldn't imagine ordering a double noodle portion!!! - but I was definitely satisfied.

The service is always friendly and prompt. The prices are a little high for the portion sizes, but it is still a good lunch spot."
