My second choice is always the Smokehouse. My wife and daughter love the one with the hot dogs mixed in, can't remember what its called because I won't eat it! haha \n\nCheck this place out when you're in the mood for pasta fast."

            "review": "Okay so here is the low down on Mac Shacks Wednesday soft opening. Walking in was a little confusing, I thought i would need to give my name or something to Verify that I was on \" The List\" but that did not happen. So we approached the register where the very friendly staff greeted us and began to give us the rundown at our request. We ended up ordering the pepper-jack mac and the asiago blue mac with 2 salads. \n\nBy the time that we got our seat situated outside with the fellow yelpers and began to kick off the conversations the food was arriving. The salad was good, it is very hard to go wrong with a garden salad and the pepper-jack mac, well... That was quite good. This product really beats the blue box. Next time I would play chef and add some chopped up jalapeno into it. \n\nBecky ordered the Asiago mac and cheese and it was also very good. I am not a huge fan of bleu cheese but this had a great flavor and was well executed. \n\nThe atmosphere fits the food, it has the hustle bustle feel, not that may be due to the fact that they were quite busy but it seemed very fast paced in there. I really don't have any complaints, the only thing I found odd was the plates and the way that they serve the food. What is with the tin with the newspaper or whatever it is with a fake wood bowl in it.... That is my only, \" Meh\" moment. \n\nGood luck mac shack and thanks for having us. Also, I swear I really did RSVP."

I also indulged with the Mac and cheese sandwich. Delish! This place has been here for years and we just found out about this place thanks to Groupon! We will be back! We will make this a regular stop anytime we are in Vegas!"

Very tasty, tasted fresh and decent quality, and for some reason it was rung up a dollar cheaper than the menu price.\n\nI'll try this place out again, but during lunch when it's cheaper and more worth it."

I tried the truffle one and it was delicious!  Price was VERY fair, I would have expected to pay way more as I have here in Vegas for crap food, but quality and taste here was great!. I got a side of breadsticks, you cant mess those up, and also side of meatballs.  Pay extra for the ricotta, adds extra goodness to them.  Ill definitely be back to try their other mac's. oh, also very quick to put my take out order together."

            "review": "This is a place for when you're in the mood to order \"fast food\" pasta.  \n\nI've been here three times now and have officially written it off.  It's like this place is where decent pasta goes to die.  Each time I go, I hope for the best, but am always let down.  \n\nI've respectively given this place two stars for their service, convenience of being able to order online and the fact that I didn't get food poisoning.  \n\nI understand that this is a place to grab quick pasta.  So, expecting the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me is asking for a wee bit too much.  However, most of the plates average about $9.00 - $10.00 a piece, and that's usually for the smaller plates.  I can spend $10.00 for a way better pasta plate at any legit Italian joint.   I always try to order the healthier stuff.  Gluten free noodles and I build my own pasta so that I can ensure what exactly will go into the plate.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of times my plates are missing certain ingredients that I clearly paid for, and it's like you make up for the missing ingredients with lots-o-oil.  Sucks.\n\nAnywho, the customer service is great here!  The people working are always friendly and quick.  You also get free garlic bread and a drink upon check in.  However, the garlic bread has always been kind of stale and flavorless.  The pasta is always super oily.  I understand how to make good pasta and oil is an active ingredient, however, there's always a ton of oil and grease leftover.  It's just too much.  After finishing a plate, I always feel like I just ate six orders of super-sized french fries at Micky D's.   I also feel the need to wash my face due to the overuse of oil.  It's that bad.  You just feel all-around crappy.  \n\nLastly, their Mac 'n' Cheese kind of sucks, too.  Almost as if it's doused in the worst cheese money can offer and a ton of oil.  It just doesn't work for me.  Like the pasta, I'm always left feeling AWFUL due to all the oil thrown into their dishes.  \n\nDon't waste your money.  Either, get a decent, quick plate at Noodles and Co. or make your own.  You'd be better off getting jarred marinara sauce and 99 cent noodles at the market.\n\nOwners/Staff:  Maybe using less oil in your dishes?  Or finding a way to funnel out some of the oil so that we're not left with a bowl full of oil.  It's similar to eating lucky charms and being left with the pink and sweet flavored milk.  Only difference being that the pink milk tastes good.  Also, when people build their own pasta...  Ensuring all ingredients are in said pasta and plenty of it as you charge 50 cents for each ingredient.  50 cents for basil?  Two words:  Rip-off."

But it was great. Fresh, meaty and yummy. \n\nWe also had pasta with garlic and oil. Then added shrimp for $.50. Only a few small shrimp were in the pasta (- 1 star)  \n\nService was friendly and helpful. Service with a smile!\n\nPricing was not bad. $17 for the both of us.

The employees are well trained and seem to have had \"If you can lean, you can clean\" ingrained into them.\n\nThe one thing I definately don't like:  this is not BK ... and you can't have it your way.  The lunch special is a pretty good deal but when I specifically said I didn't want soup or salad I was told I HAD to take it.  What kind of restaurant forces you to take something you don't want?  I suggested another breadstick instead and was told no.   I guess they wanted to see a full bowl of soup (its 105* out .. I don't want soup) get thrown in the garbage instead.\n\nI was told this is Franks rule.  I think that was the owners name ... \n\nThe bottom line is that I don't need Mac Shacks food, but I imagine Mac Shack needs my business ..."

What really stands out to me are the number of choices and the vast combination possibilities. That's fantastic. Also, you get fresh pasta dishes and quickly. I LOVE that they offer Farro and Wheat pastas! I've had the Farro in one of their \"Favorties\" called THE VEGGIE and it was delicious. Simple, garlic-y, and the vegetables were fresh. I've had the CRAZY ALFREDO multiple times (usually with penne) and it's been delicious. The last time I visited though, the shrimp was not good and the sauce was just okay. Everything else that myself and my companions have tried has been tasty. I think the prices are decent for their portions, however, they may have changed that since the beginning. Next time, I'm definitely creating my own with some basil, ricotta, garlic & oil sauce, and a bunch of vegetables. That sounds good right now, haha! Anyway, it's a great place when you want pasta quick and relatively fresh, especially if you just don't want to cook."

The prices are not too steep....$8-$10 should get you a large portion with decent mix-ins and they give you a 20% discount for Meatless Mondays. Quite progressive for Las Vegas if I should say so. There is also \"Baby Bowls\" catered towards children but really, there's more than enough pasta in one for a full-grown human. \n\nThe pasta dishes I've had really haven't blown me away. I can make better pasta at home. With fresher ingredients. BUT....sometimes out of sheer lethargy and a massive carb craving, Mac Shack will do the trick. If I didn't work close to this restaurant I probably wouldn't bother with it. \n\nSummary: Palatable pastas, not-so-fresh ingredients, bordering on stinginess on quantities of toppings and decent service.\n\nIt's doable but do I really want to \"settle\" so often?"

I went in with two friends for lunch and the place already seemed busy which is a good sign. The staff was very friendly and eager to explain the concept which is a pleasant surprise for fast food. I agree with Misti that it seems like a Chiptole style fast food joint that serves pasta.\n\nThe funny part about my order was that I stole it from one of the pre-made \"Mac favorites\" and saved myself a quarter. I got penne with the broccoli pesto and roasted garlic. My friends both ordered overloaded pasta with lots of toppings but both settled on more traditional sauces. Their dishes were both delicious but I ended up not enjoying my dish as much as I had hoped. The flavor was incredible but my pasta looked to be swimming. It appears the chef didn't realize I ordered pasta and not soup. If they had toned down the amount of sauce or added more pasta I think the result would've been a 4 star lunch.\n\nLike I mentioned above the jury is still out on this place until I can try a lot more combos. The fact that I enjoyed 2 out of 3 dishes and the 3rd could be saved with a bit of tweaking makes me think I'll be visiting this place semi-frequently. I'm glad I pestered my friends until they accompanied me. Hopefully I'll be able to bump the rating to 4 stars on my next visit. Mmm....Alfredo!"

The clerk recommended the Buffalo pasta. It sucked. I'm flying out of the country soon and I hope I don't get sick. I'm usually not this critical, but save your $10 -$12 or go somewhere else.

To define Mac Shack, its a new and extremely well done pasta driven italian style restaurant.  I won't call it fast food but, from the time I ordered the food it was on my table within a few minutes and I was in and out of the place in about 45 min.\n\nThe menu varies from their combinations of food or you can get very adventurous and create your own meal.  When ordering there is a glass case with all the optional items for you to see and drool over.  The place even has descent selection of wine and beer.\n\nI ordered the asiago-blue mac and cheese and it was delicious.  You could taste the real cheese in every bite and the pasta was slightly al dente like I prefer. I went with a friend and he had the \"farm house\" which he described as tasty and well rounded.  I snuck a bite and will be ordering it next time.  \n\nI highly recommend this place just keep the inner child at bay, as its impossible to keep that little bugger happy!"

We came when they were about to shut down and made us feel welcome to get a to go order.  The one criticism I had about flavors was my red pepper sauce was really a cream sauce with a light red pepper flavor.  I definitely wish it had been a little heavier on the red pepper.  \n\nI will say that after my last review I received a long letter from the owner saying he had tried the pasta I had and realized I was right and fixed the problem with the pesto.

It's expensive if you don't get the lunch special.\n\nFirst, if you're waiting in line to order and get to the register AFTER the lunch special expires, well, they expect you to pay full price. That's a load of crap.\n\nSecond, if a company sends out a text message discount with no expiration date, THEN THEY ARE LEGALLY BOUND TO HONOR IT, but not according to the pimple faced kid behind the counter who said \"Oh, we don't do that one any more.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't patronize your restaurant any longer.\"\n\nIf you don't care about your customers, you deserve to go out of business.

It was a busy Friday but the line moved quickly and the smell was incredible. My friend described it pretty accurately as a pasta version of chipotle - just meaning that its quick, reasonable and customizable. \nI decided on a special made up of mac and cheese made w Gouda, big pieces of bacon, a touch of tangy bbq sauce and I added chicken. I was a little hesitant about the bbq sauce but it was just like a bbq chicken pizza but in pasta form! Can't go wrong with that. \nIt was a huge portion for about $10 and they have a lot of great options to customize your pasta. Its not really a full service restaurant - you take a number and they bring your food when it's ready. Because of that, I was surprised that they had very good service. The manager (who was also the one who took my order) walked around making sure everyone was happy with their food. He brought me a to go box, cleared our dishes promptly. \nMac shack was a winning combo of good food, low prices and unexpectedly great customer service."

IMO there's a lack of places to grab a quick bite to eat in the SW area by Rhodes Ranch. I don't do fast food so that limits the scope. \n\nI always get the 'Bottle Service' which is pasta in a vodka cream sauce with grilled steak, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. I would give this dish 3 stars alone but the other items I've tried are 2 stars or lower. Baked ziti is meh and their alfredo has so much stuff in it, it takes away from the dish. I want to say it has chicken, shrimp, sausage and about 3 other veggies mixed with a very watery alfredo. Dishes have also been pretty inconsistent and I've only gone a few times here.\n\nOn the plus side, their prices are reasonable and decent portions enough for a 2nd meal. I like that they carry The Cupcakery cupcakes if you're hankering for a nice dessert and the complimentary lollipops are a nice touch for the kiddos. And the place is always super clean and inviting."

Well, the \"some time\" was last Sunday.\nBefore going to any restaurant,  I \"Yelp\" it  and also look up the restaurant website.  Because of their connection with Nora's Cuisine on Jones/Flamingo, we decided to give Mac Shack a try.\nYou order at the counter, take a number, get your own drink and sit at a table.  All the tables were not cleaned or wiped or they had the last patron's empty cups still sitting on the table.  We took the table with the empty cups, (there goes a star)\nWe ordered a Caesar's Salad to share with their homemade dressing.  The romaine lettuce insides were mostly used, (not the leafy middle sections), croutons were not crispy at all and the dressing was too mayonaisey...(bye bye to a star and a half...)  The roll was very good but no butter...\nHubby ordered the lasagna which was just okay...he didn't finish it... Hubby says, it's kind of mall  Food court food or fast food....(tata to another star and a half..)  His iced tea was very good.\nNow...on the other hand, my veggie pasta plus garlic was very good - pasta was not overcooked and the veggies were yummy! (brought a star back)\nThis was an okay place....hubby won't come back but I most likely will for carbo loading before my cycling or tri events.  In fact, they should advertise it to the sporting events around town.\nThey had some empty walls that should be used for at least 4 flat screens.  One guy looked so bored sitting there.\nIf we ordered the \"make your own\", dishes,  I don't know if the price would have been more expensive.  If it was, then it's probably over priced.\nCustomer service was so so....they didn't notice the empty cups until we told them to clear it off.\n(We should also be able to put half, (1/2) stars for the ratings.)"

I really like the concept of pick your pasta and sauce and picking what other toppings to mixed with pasta.  We ordered the linguini meat sauce with zucchini and mushrooms and also the broccoli pesto penne with chicken.  Both dishes didn't have enough sauce, so the pasta was on the dry side.

They have several types of \"gourmet\" mac n cheese. My favorite is the pepper jack mac which is macaroni topped with monterey jack, pepper jack, and asiago cheeses and jalapenos.\nThe macs run from $6.95-$7.95 then I add Sausage ($1.50) and fresh tomatoes (.50c) and fresh spinach (.50c). \nMy date ordered the fettuccine noodles with alfredo sauce ($7) then added a double order of shrimp ($1.75 x 2)....yea...so everybody else has said it so I'll say it too. An order of shrimp is 2 shrimp! They are by no means small, but if feel like 3 would be a little more substantial.\n\nThe portions for both the pastas and the mac's are filling for me and I have a big appetite.

The good thing is that portion size makes up for the price you pay so as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. \n\nWord of advice - use the Yelp check-in and you receive a regular drink and free garlic bread sticks, totally worth it or else you're paying $13-$15 for a bowl of mac & cheese.\n\nI've come into Mac Shack at different times and one of the negative things is that the quality of the food is never consistent. My last trip here was fantastic which was during the day! The pasta actually had sauce on it where my previous visit (at night) my poor noodles were dry. It would be great if there was a little more cooking consistency. I gave them an extra star from last experience since the food tasted better than previous. As long as I can use the check-in, I'll be back."

One trip to this place did that for me. \n\nStarted by having the person at the counter took a phone call right when I was ordering, stayed on the phone, then had to go to the back to get whom ever for the call. once I ordered, got my beverage and sat down, food came in about 5 minutes. Server switched my food with another table, so it had to be redone. Once I got my new food, I then needed to ask for another fork. Once I got the fork and tried my food, I was so disappointed with all of it. Got the Asiago Blue Mac, with port mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, chicken and caramelized onions. The cheese sauce tasted nothing like asiago or blue cheese. It was very bland and watery. Portion was small. The chicken was tough, the onions not caramelized and the mushrooms tasted old. No manager to be seen anywhere I left my meal half finished on the table. Great concept with terrible execution. Stay away till they work out the food flavor and quality issues. If you go, don't say I didn't warn you."

You could also build your own pasta as well.\n\nBAKED RIGATONI $8.75 - this was pretty good but a little bland on the marinara red sauce but eat it with the ricotta cheese backed on top & it is perfect goodness.\n\nMAKE TRUFFLE MAC & CHZ $10.25 - it is mac & cheese created for the adult kid that still loves mac & cheese but they made it suffisticated by adding truffle with some crunchy breaded crumbs on top! Every bite was cheesy goodness.\n\nI thought the portion amount was good for the price & it wasn't bad even taking it togo.

She recommended adding some ham in to give it more flavor and she was 100% correct. \n\nAsiago Blue Mac consist of Asiago, blue cheese, pecorino romano topped with blue cheese crumbles. \n\nIt is like a build your own pasta place also, which is fun to have the choice of adding a protein, or meat of some sort to your dish.

I'm a huge fan of mac and cheese, I guess I never really grew up, but this place just makes it fun and unlike anything I've had before. Myself and a guest decided to check this place out since it's down the street from my place. Located on Warm Springs and Durango, this little shack has a lot around it. We walked in and were promptly greeted by the cashier. We were in the mood for fettuccine and wanted to try something popular. We considered getting a BYOB (build yo own bowl). This however included too many options for me. I mean bowties, penne, fettuccine, or elbows?!?! How could we decided!! Lucky we had an amazing cashier who let us try some the sauces just to give us a better idea of what we were getting. One of the sauces I tried was the pesto, which they had cold... So i was to imagine it warm.. I'm just gonna come back and try it. We decided to get the chicken alfredo and the cheddar mac sammich. Also while paying I realized I hadn't checked in yet. So, I checked in and received free bread sticks!! YUMM. We were gonna order a side anyways so it's nice that it was free. They gave us our numbers and we grab drinks and sat down. I was excited they have blue powerade. Most places just have the standar coke sprite and stuff. They have tables and chairs or booths. I wanted the booth side and made my friend take the chair side. HAHA, cushion for my butt!! After waiting maybe 10 minutes or so all of our food was out. I got right to it with a fork full of alfredo and chicken. The alfredo sauce was delicious, however I'm wasn't the hugest fan of the chicken slices. They were a little bland. I added some crushed peppers to spice it up, and we were back in action. We then move to the cheddar mac and cheese sammich. It was great. Nice toasted bread with cheddar mac.. Oh, ill be back for another round and hopefully soon. Cool part is when you clean your own plate you can grab a tootie pop at the door, mine are still sitting the in the car but it was a nice gesture. :)"

Once you start adding toppings it starts getting a little expensive, but it's nice to have so many fresh options. \n\nI tend to lean towards the mac n cheeses since I'm not a huge pasta fanatic. Add a little chicken or some veggies and you've got a great meal. \n\nMake sure you sign up on their eNewsletter and you'll receive lots of discounts and a free meal on your birthday."

And it's too spicy for me. Maybe a Level 8 out of 10\n\n... I had to try their Vodka Penne. It's the right amount of creaminess!! All in all good.\n\n... Cannoli and dips for dessert. It was still good after 3 days in the fridge but personally I like my cannoli rolled and stuffed, not to be dipped in cream. \n\nThis will be our new family restaurant!!

The cashier Patrick had no personality, but robotically said \"sure,\" and \"no problem\" several times with little or nothing more to say. \n\nThis was a to-go order. Overall, the Pepper Jack dish $8.65 with added sausage (6 small slices) for an additional $1.95 was nothing special. The sausage was flavorless.

Let me make this simple and quick. The variety of the pastas, toppings and sauces is impressive, though the flavor wasn't much to write home about (but apparently enough to write Yelp about). I got the lunch special that came with a stale cold breadstick, cold and salty soup (corn chowder), and a \"create-your-own\" pasta. The soup was terrible, the breadstick was terrible, and the pasta was so so. We came here thinking this place would be a bit more upscale than it is, but it turns out that it is fairly \"fast food-ish\". I would have preferred to have eaten at Roberto's next door.

I have been sick, so I was looking for a nice chicken noodle soup - but delivered because I'm sick.  I wouldn't even call this soup.  It was a mixture of half cooked carrots, celery, and peas along with hard stringy dry chicken pieces.  There was about a tablespoon of broth that had the flavor of water.  No salt, no pepper, no flavor at all.  My son who was not sick, agreed.  I figured macaroni and cheese would be the best ever since it is what they say they do.  Nope.  Flavorless and no seasoning.  How do they actually serve this crap and call it Mac and cheese?  \nAlso ordered baked rigatoni - had some flavor, but mushy and below average for sure.  \nDo yourself a favor and stop anywhere besides this place. Anywhere. Campbell's canned soup is better than theirs as is Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Unbelievable that anyone goes here."

It's a pretty reasonable price compared to their regular menu, which I don't really care for. I find the regular menu to be too expensive. \n\nMac Shack is convenient for me since it's right across from work. Besides that, I probably wouldn't visit. Just because pasta is something I can always whip up at home, but if I'm in a pasta kinda mood during my lunch break at work, I would head over here.\n\nI've done pretty much any combo you could imagine in their lunch special. My pasta has always been al-dente for the most part & I seriously have eaten here over 20+ times for the past few years I've worked at my workplace. I particularly like their meat sauce. Sometimes I add bacon or sausage for an add'l fee. Don't really care for their Tomato Soup but I do order it if I don't feel like eating a salad with my pasta. And about that salad, they're not consistent with it. Sometimes I'd get too much dressing or lack it. Too much croutons or I'd be lucky to have at least 4 in there.\n\nAnd the bread.. A year ago, I loved the garlic bread. Probably my favorite part of my meal. I'm not sure what they're doing now but they've changed it a couple times, perhaps experimenting which one would be the best type of bread. Honestly, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!\n\nAll in all, I suggest coming here for lunch for their lunch special. Good price for a complete meal. But if you can just cook your own pasta at home, I suggest just doing that."

I guess this shows that every place can have an off day... or that restaurants can respond well to criticism and be worthy of a second chance.\n\nWe've been back a few times to Mac Shack since that underwhelming first try, and each time we've been treated with extreme courtesy, and each time the food has been delicious. \n\nThe protein and other chunky \"add-ons\" (like mushrooms) are now plentiful and easy to find in the bowl, unlike the first trip. The bread is hot, soft, and delicious - which I only know because it's free with a Yelp app check-in, along with a soda. I have to respect how savvy Mac Shack is to offer this to their (presumably) more opinionated customers. (And now my smartphone-less husband will be ordering his own on future visits and trying some of mine. Way to get us hooked!)\n\nI also appreciate that the company offers a discount if you order a meatless dish on a Monday. As a vegetarian living in 2011 (as opposed to the less enlightened days of endless baked potatoes and cheese pizza), it boggles my mind that people still ask, \"But-but-but, what do you EAT?\" Mac Shack is challenging its value-minded meat-eating customers to get creative while saving some money. (With a bonus of rewarding vegetarians plus getting more people to save some resources, but - shhh - no preaching.)\n\nOur return visits have been so satisfying that I'm tempted to give Mac Shack five stars. Only one thing - okay, two things - prevents this. First, and this is a total nitpick issue that I expect any sensible person to ignore, they've started selling really expensive (and not particularly impressive) cupcakes from a certain popular local bakery. Didn't I just mention that it's 2011? Why are they trying to jump on the Hipster Cupcake Wagon *now*? (And why with a subpar, overhyped product?)\n\nThe second thing, and this is the real reason I'm docking a star, is that you can't go half-n-half on the sauces at Mac Shack. If you want, say, alfredo and spicy red mixed together, you have to pay the full price for EACH sauce, even though you're only getting half of each. For a place that's all about designing your own pasta dish, this seems like a strange rule. (And one I don't encounter at live pasta stations at buffets, which work under a similar philosophy of choosing your own ingredients.) I'd understand if they were just trying to prevent a bad mix, but you *can* mix the sauces, you just have to pay twice as much. It's, like, a creativity tax, you could say. (Something you wouldn't expect from a place selling cupcakes topped in the emperor's new icing.)\n\nBut overall, I'm really pleased we gave Mac Shack another go. Solid fare, plenty of variety, and a pleasant, casual atmosphere."

I could have eaten 2 meals but I really didn't want to take out a loan for it. The total bill for two people with two drinks was like 25 bucks. I never understood why pasta places charge so much for so little. But I don't run the store so I have no clue what the operating costs are.\n\nI recommend every one tries it at least once. I'll go back but I think it's a bit pricey for me to be a regular"

Really easy to find and if your in the SW part of town it's probably a place you have driven by many times. Located on Warm Springs, across from Vons it has a very spacious inside with a Subway type of feel (in a good way) to ordering. \nThe menu is very simple to order off of and there are plenty of options to keep you coming back to try them all. The food overall is very good, just a little salty. I have tried a few different dish combinations with Alfredo sauce, meat sauce and a few different combinations of near add ons. Overall very nice place to grab a quick and easy pasta dish without having to go to a chain restaurant."

The girl that took our order was apparantly hard of hearing because when ordering she kept repeating back items differently..then when we finally get the order right and we are waiting to get our food, she had put it as a take out order instead of dine in. As for the food, the vodka sauce was yummy with the penne pasta, but the shrimp scampi was such a disappointment. The noodles were al dente but more of a \"sitting around and dried out\" way. The shrimp were tiny and void of flavor.the breadsticks were stale and dry."

The pricing may seem a little bit high, but you do get what you paid for in noodles. oodles and oodles of it. Haaah, I can barely finish my bowl and I eat like a maniac. But overall, Mac Shack was a incredible experience for me. The friendly staff to the great food. Awesome.\n\nIf you're undecided on what to get. Make your own and go crazyyy! My personal fav'is the fettuccine noodles with vodka sauce and a little bacon goes a long way, plus some healthy choices like spinach and mushrooms. Delish and Yummy!"

It's good, affordable, and quick.\n\nWhen it comes to my mac and cheese, I am a plain jane.  I love traditional cheesy macaroni.  Usually I just get regular mac and cheese.  But lately I have been getting the chicken noodle soup (which is pretty good) and the grilled mac and cheese (seriously amazing!!).  My boyfriend took a bite of it and was extremely jealous.\n\nMy boyfriend gets the crazy alfredo (chicken, sausage, shimp, red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, jalapenos, alfredo sauce) and absolutely loves it.  We also get the garlic bread, which in all honestly needs a little salt and should be cooked longer.\n\nService here is (usually) really good."

There are take home boxes available next to the soda station.\n\nThis is a nice, inexpensive place to go with anyone, especially a bunch of picky eaters... they can make their food to their own liking.  You can specify to \"go light on the sauce\" if you want.  The decor is actually really attractive with Peter Lik photos throughout.

It's an answer to Chipotle for pasta. \n\nThe BF and I shared - \n\nFarmHouse - this was OK. I liked the sauce, but I could have honestly done without the toppings as the ham was salty for me and the peas were fine. There was no egg, though it says on the menu there is. \n\nBottle service - I liked their vodka sauce and mushrooms, but it was skimpy on beef. It didn't really need it. \n\nPortions I think were good as we were both pretty full sharing and had a few bites we couldn't finish. \n\nI did a checkin for a free order of breadsticks (2pc). It was standard, but good. \n\nIt seems the way to go here really is meat free. I feel like once the meat is added its slightly much for order up food and it didn't really add much to the dish. I will make my own and stick to veggies. They do a pretty decent lunch special for $6.99, but I did not catch the timeframe it runs and if it is daily. \n\nI will probably be back, but it's not a spot I would be running back to. For a quick bite though, I would definitely order something with the vodka sauce again."

            "review": "When a friend of ours finally revealed to us that Mac Shack was not a trendy place to have creepy computer networking parties while enjoying overpriced coffee, my wife and I decided that a mac and cheese based restaurant sounded cool. After we discovered that Mac Shack was being brought to us by the genius culinary artists of Nora's, we couldn't wait to try it out. Spoiler alert...this place makes food that Nora was making in an Easy Bake Oven 45 years ago, and I recommend that if you want a similar quality of food for over half the price, go up the street to Fazoli's. \n \nSo, my first indication that Mac Shack was a terrible experience was the typo on the door sign. If you are going to throw obscene amounts of money into your pursuit of being the next Chipotle, learn how to use apostrophes (i.e. \"pasta's).\n\nThe menu was put together nicely. I was a little weirded out by the TV on the side showing off-menu items and specials. It felt a little too-cool-for-school to use a TV to show off specials, but maybe I am old school in that way. I like the blackboard and chalk approach way more. Anyhow, we settled on some tasty sounding menu items. I ordered the Pepper Jack Mac, my wife got the Red Rigatoni, and we ordered the Baby Mac and Cheese for our son. We also ordered a house side salad, a Caesar side salad, and bread sticks. I kind of freaked out when our bill was 40 dollars. Were we at Nora's or a place called Mac Shack? We should have gone to Nora's. \n\nThe food took a while to come out, but it wasn't too bad of a wait. The food came, and it was hot enough to fry an egg on top of our pastas. Literally, steam was racing off the top of my son's \"Baby Mac and Cheese.\" He waited 20 minutes to eat. This is always a pleasant experience with a 3-year-old who loves mac and cheese.\n\nSo we ate bread sticks and salad. I think the bread they serve here may come from a bag. They were chewy and the crust wasn't crispy, warm, or buttery. If they are homemade, I am solidifying my theory that they are using easybake ovens in the kitchen. \n\nThe house salad was really good. I can say that the best thing we had was the garden salad. Dressing was good and the greens were fresh and interesting. The Caesar was really bad. The dressing tasted like i was shoving anchovy paste in my mouth. It was too much fish. It could work in some restaurants, but really not a good idea for Chipotle gone pasta. \n\nOnce the food cooled down, it was very boring. By the end of the meal, we were thinking how we could make all this at home for a quarter of the price. We discovered that this place makes a great meatball (The meatball and house salad are the only reason I would rate this place two stars), but everything else was just mediocre. The serving sizes don't jive with the prices, and they were not exciting presentations. The Pepper Jack Mac comes with \"fried jalepenos\" but when it came, it had 3 razor thin slices of raw jalepenos. Not very exciting. The red rigatoni was saved by the meatball, but everything else about it was sad. The sauce was bland, the chicken sausage had little flavor and the pasta was overcooked. My son's pasta was a step up from Kraft. Except I would never bring pasta that hot to a kid. \n\nAt the end of the meal, my son had a Fruit Roll-Up to look forward to. I am just thinking here....and if I were developing a cool, trendy pasta place with innovative and exciting dishes that I was trying to market to foodies....I would probably serve kids meals with Fruit Roll-Ups. This was the perfect end to a perfectly disastrous meal. I don't like giving my kid Fruit Roll-ups, and I have to wonder about a restaurant that does. McDonalds even has fresh fruit these days. But they could have even done a cookie or ice cream. Why on earth would they serve something that you could buy prepackaged at Smiths? \n\nIn closing, this place has all of their attention focused on making this a franchise-worthy experiment. But you cannot be the next Chipotle when you have ordinary food. I don't even think they should try to be the next Chipotle, but it is clear that is their main goal with Mac Shack. In the end, I don't even think the first restaurant will succeed if they cannot figure out how to make better food at a more appropriate price. But based on some of the yuppies giving this place 5 stars, maybe I have no idea what good food is. \n\nNext time we are looking for good \"pasta's\" we will not dine at Mac Shack. Hopefully nobody that reads this review will make the same mistake we did."

I paid about $30 including tip for my boyfriend and myself for watery pasta covered in bleh (flavorless) sauce with skimpy portions of toppings. We ordered the alfredo and the rigatoni with some toppings. Certainly not impressed. The portions were not that impressive either. For the same price, I'd rather go to Olive Garden and have something tastier. \n\nPerhaps I didn't do a good job of building my own pasta there. But I swear I am - I can build a mean tasting pasta at home with some Ragu and store bought pasta with toppings lying around the house for half the price."

            "review": "Several months ago, after our first visit to Mac Shack, I wasn't sure how to write a review. The food was OK, but I suspected some of the issues I had were more to do with me ordering poorly for my tastes as well as being the result of some miscommunications as a result of differing accents.\n\nWe've just returned from our third go at Mac Shack and I think I've got my order \"down\" enough to write a review and decide I really do like the place.  I think it's neat the way you can customise your own pasta dishes, as well as order from a set list of creations. It's sort of like Cold Stone Creamery meets The Olive Garden. The bread sticks are fresh and tasty and the restaurant is really low pressure without feeling like something you'd find in a food court.  Something else I appreciated greatly was the absence of loud, blasting music, that has become a fact of life in so many dining establishments - here it's pleasantly muted.\n\nOne think I feel could really improve the options here would be the ability to mix sauces. I like the roasted pepper sauce, particularly as I enjoy a creamy sauce, but it's a little bland and mixing it with a dash of the spicy read sauce would really make it a winner for me - alas, you can't mix sauces without paying the full price for a second sauce, even though you'd only be using half as much of each. This seems a bit silly to me.\n\nOverall, the food here is very good for the price. I love the casual atmosphere and the options. A little more ability to configure my dishes to my own taste would really make this a winner."

You can make your own pasta creation from the type of pasta, sauce, and toppings. There's also premade recipes to choose from, creating a variety of options.\n\nThere is even grilled cheese that has macaroni and cheese instead of your typical melted cheese. Add bacon or ham to switch it up. I've been here several times and have ordered a different entree each time. Each one was enjoyable and it is perfect for a quick lunch during lunch hour or order to go for the family after work. I recommend this place for it's delicious eats at reasonable prices!

As other reviews have stated, its solid as a \"Chipotle for Pasta\" type experience, but its nothing to write home about.  They do continue to stiff you on whatever protein you order with your pasta.  Don't expect any more than two pieces of chicken, shrimp, etc. when you order.  But those complaints have never been enough to keep me from going.  \n\nHere's what is...\n\nRobert, I don't know if you're the manager or owner or just a shift manager or something but your customer service is awful.  Awful enough to make me write a Yelp review.  You are aloof and rude every single time I've had the displeasure of dealing with you.  You have screwed up my order on three separate occasions.  I come in for to-go orders on a regular basis.  On one evening you stood next to the girl on the register while the line continued to build.  Having food management experience myself, I assumed you were training her.  But after a 15 minute wait, I finally got to the front of the line and it became clear that no, this was an experienced employee and you were just...well, what exactly WERE you doing?  You then decided to inform me that I \"should know better\" that I don't have to wait for to-go orders.  Here's an idea, get on the other register and get the line moving faster and it wouldn't have mattered.  Today, I came in around noon with no one in front of me, but I had to wait for you to finish your conversation with a staff member before I was greeted and allowed to place my order; an order that I discovered you ONCE AGAIN screwed up because you were clearly more interested in whatever your conversation was than giving me, the customer, your attention.  \n\nThe food and the environment were good enough, not great, but good enough to make me a regular in the past, but I think my days of visiting the Mac Shack are over thanks to one employee.  So thank you Robert.\n\nUpdate:  After writing the above review I was contact by both Robert and one of the owners.  They apologized for the poor service and expressed a desire to do better if I gave them another chance.  \n\nI appreciated their effort and their desire to make things right.  I do not know if I'll ever be in a mood to visit the Mac Shack again, but if I do and their service standards change, I will update the review again."

I filled out the info for them to deliver and realized they were about to close for the evening. I called them and they took my order for pickup, which wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it beat going out to eat.\n\nI ordered a custom pasta with whole wheat noodles, Alfredo sauce, broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus, jalape\u00f1os and sun dried tomatoes. I wanted a salad to go with it so the guy recommended a Green Machine side salad.  $12.97 including tax, not bad for a large custom pasta order + salad. \n\nI arrived a few minutes before they closed and forgot I had transferred my credit card to my gym bag, so all I had was a bunch of change at the bottom of my purse. Uh oh. I walked in and scraped together 1's and all of the coins in my purse and i had just enough!  Phew!  The guy was really nice and patient while I was annoyingly scraping up my change for him. Lol.  He was very nice. \n\nI brought my pasta home and opened my pasta...smells so good!  It was delicious!  The jalape\u00f1os were cut perfectly so even if I are one in a bite, it didn't overwhelm the flavors of everything else. It was great for the price, I have to say!  The Green Machine was different but WOW so delicious!!  The dressing is what really makes that salad pop. Loved it! \n\nGreat service, great food, amazing value. I'll be back very very soon.

His name is written out with a sharpie marker and General Manager is spelled wrong. LOL glad to see how important he is."

I wanted to try something different and have never had a broccoli pesto before. I didn't like it. It as blank the gnocchi was over cooke because again it was mushy. Might have been pre-prepared because the tops of the dumplings were dry. \n\nPasta dishes that we ordered:\nbroccoli pesto: bland and not satisfying. Had to add salt and some other ingredients to make it through the meal \n\nfarm house\n\nthe bottle service pasta: probably the best one that we tried out of the three. Still bland and not quite as flavorful as described in their description. \n\nYou go in your order they give you a number and the food is  brought to you. \n\na great idea but needs work in the flavor department. Checked in on yelp and got a coupon for free breadsticks. Those also were not amazing. Olive garden beats their breadsticks."

My girlfriend ordered rigatoni with meat sauce and ricotta. I also ordered a side Caesar and garlic bread.\n\nThe salads didn't find their way to our table until a few minutes after our pasta. They had a strong fishy flavor and lacked the salty garlic taste I expect in a Caesar salad. The mac and cheese had a strange sweetness to it, possibly from the barbecue sauce they put in it. If you order this dish ask them to leave it out. Better yet, don't order it. There was very little smoky flavor other than in the bacon itself. Some red pepper flake (in a shaker on the table) helped a bit, but I didn't finish more than a few bites.\n\nThe rigatoni was OK but the meat sauce was a bit short on meat. And again, basic seasoning was lacking.\n\nWhat they call garlic bread is actually breadsticks. Honestly, Olive Garden does them better. I get an order free on my next visit thanks to my Yelp check-in, but I don't think there will be a next visit."

Mac Shack has three salads and two soups to choose from and a build your own pasta option that all combine to meet the demands of even the pickiest of eaters.\n\nI opted for the Spinach Salad that comes with walnuts, thinly sliced red onions and pears, not the greatest for your breath but certainly the right blend of crisp and crunchy.  It even comes with a mini-muffin that was both soft and buttery.  As for my pasta I went with the Red Rigatoni that was topped off with meatballs, sausage, and roasted red peppers.  I did enjoy the meatballs and sausage where were more than I expected with such an affordable dish.  \n\nThis is a great place if you have a hankering for some quick pasta and maybe a salad but are crunched for time.  The service was friendly and attentive and the food came out fast and tasty.  I'll give it three stars for you can enjoy yourself and even add a glass of wine with fast food Italian, but it certainly isn't the place to go if you're seeking a gourmet Italian experience."

A friend and I were so fired up that we decided to get four different options and then taste test from them all.  We got the truffle mac, the smokehouse mac, the spinach artichoke mac, and we created our own pasta that was a penne pesto with mozzarella.  Of all of the options, the truffle mac was the only one that I'd really kill for.  But, I am biased because I am a FIEND for anything truffle!  Otherwise, all the others were \"eh.\"  I don't know if my expectations killed the dream, but I just wasn't amazed.  \n\nThey do sell beer and wine which is nice!  AND, they DELIVER.  Which is definitely nice to know.  If I'm ever sitting home and don't feel like throwing together some mac n' cheese it's a great option.

I came in with the family ad everything was perfect. Timmy the server was very helpful and patient with our indecisiveness and he helped us find a choice. He was also very funny and helped my mom come up with a choice (in the end she went with the kids meal which was the mac and meatball even though she cooked us spaghetti the night before) I would suggest the shrimp scampi which is my favorite! Enough shrimp and just right scamp in scampi! If you love cheese try the asiago blue Mac. It's loaded with cheese! It has asiago blue cheese, Romano, and blue cheese crumbles on top. I had it with chicken which Balances the meal with the cheeses. It's not too tangy or thick in texture to make you feel easily filled. I had that smokehouse BBQ one also and the pesto one. Those are just as good too! Definitely have to try the BBQ at least once. It's life changing.\n\nThe decor is fabulous and especially since they feature Peter lik artwork! So the artwork changes it's time of day depending on the lighting!!! Free wifi and a wide wide wide selection in soda and tea! Score! I love soda selections! It's the best thing to have choices so you can experiment with combinations!!!! Then then then! To top it all off...you leave and see this beautiful wooden box filled with flavorful tootsie pops to go! (that you angels from above!!!!) best meal of my life and left me feeling good about my meal. Life changing I tell you.\n\nDo check in to get the garlic bread and drink. It's worth it!!!!"

Many places say they have gluten free choices, but when you're actually at the restaurant many servers and employees look at you like you're speaking another language. I was so relieved when coming to the Mac Shack. The manager, Robert, was so knowledgeable about food allergies/sensitivities that I was able to enjoy my food without worrying about having a reaction. \n\nThis restaurant is pretty big and has a open feel. It felt like I was getting a gourmet meal without having to get dolled up, parking etc. Place your order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Perfect. Done. You choose your pasta, sauce and toppings. All orders are cooked to order, which helps decrease the chances of cross contamination. They also have salads and their own creations available. \n\nI ordered the gluten free pasta with garlic-oil sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, porcini mushrooms and cheese. It was heaven and a great combination. Pasta was cooked perfectly, which is an art with gluten free pasta. My friends tasted it and they loved my combination and said they would have never known it was gluten free pasta. In fact, they had to help me finish my food because the portion was fairly large for me. They did not hesitate. \n\nOne of my friends had the asiago mac n cheese and the other made her own combination w/meatballs. They both loved their dishes too. \n\nThis is now one of my favorite restaurants off of the strip and will return when loading up on carbs for the Vegas 1/2 in December."

I agree 100% with Misti that from the moment you walk inside you think to yourself: Chipotle.\n\nThe Shack is nothing like a shack.  It's presented clean, neat, well organized, and simple.  You have a plethora of menu items including the do-it yourself Pasta section.  There is wine and beer available and veggie options as well as sirloin, shrimp, bacon, ham, and more cheese!  I found myself in love with all the menu choices.\n\nI chose the PepperJack Mac and my date selected the Blue Cheese Mac.  When the entrees were brought to the table they were switched around and tasted a little off.  After one bite we knew we would be sending them back.  Adam, the Mac Shack server/buser was very kind and quickly had are orders redone and made correctly.  I will never downgrade a rating for making a wrong order; we're all human.  It's what the restaurant does after that tells me if they care. \n\nAdam brought our new orders of Mac and they tasted delicious.  I'm a fan of Mac Shack and plan on a return visit very soon.

I love that it's located right around the corner from my place.\n\nAnyways, my review will be based solely on my to-go experience and the shrimp scampi I ordered. I am not one to discriminate against pastas; I love and adore all equally, but have recently grown an obsession for shrimp scampi. I've made it myself before, but on days when I want pasta and don't feel like putting the minimum effort in cooking I will invest in to-go pasta. I truly believe the shrimp scampi is for pasta lovers that do NOT like creamy pasta sauces. The wine sauce is a good amount for this dish and they are giving with the shrimp and pasta. I must say that the garlic bread isn't that great which can explain the 4 stars. It just wasn't \"garlic-y\" enough and not soft enough for my liking.\n\nThe place itself is very spacious and has a warm light to it. The cashier counter have a nice display of \"fake\" pasta and dishes they make. I enjoyed the staff as well since they were very friendly. \n\nI will be back to a dine-in experience, so my review will be updated.. HOWEVER, for now I say I am a Mac Shack fan!"

There is so little cheese in the Chedder mac that you have to order it with double cheese just to it is not a bowl of pasta and b\u00e9chamel sauce. Which of course, drives the price even higher.

It has a really good vibe to it. \nIt's super clean, the staffs are very friendly, everything is very organized. \nThe portion they gave us was enormous, you can order one order for two normal size people. We ordered one each and didn't finish but hey, I love left overs lol \nWe had the buffalo chicken Mac, which was AMAZING! It was so so delicious, it tastes like you're eating an actually buffalo chicken wing and it even has carrots and celery! Haha it was so good. \nThe other order we ordered was the smokehouse Mac. It wasn't my fav but it wasn't the worst thing in the world, my bro in love loves it just as much as the buffalo. When you eat it you can taste the smokiness flavor in the Gouda cheese. Oh yeah, they have different cheese for each kind of Mac. \nAnyway, it was a very pleasant visit. \nI wouldn't mind coming back. :p"

I ordered philly cheesesteak mac and bottle service and for both the pasta was undercooked. I wouldn't even call it al dente... way undercooked is more like it. The philly mac came with very little meat on it while the sirloin beef in the bottle service was definitely not sirloin, more like a week old meat was used. Meat was very tough and tasted horrible and definitely not fresh. This Mac Shack location is a huge let down and I will never be back. So sad since I just moved in this area. Parking is also horrible on a friday around 1pm. I must have circled 3x before I was able to park and wasted 20 bucks on inedible pasta."

There are a dozen pastas and ten different sauces to choose from, then you chose veggies, cheeses and proteins to be added. We thought we'd go with one of \"Mac's Favs\" the Broccoli Pesto ($7.50) and we'd also try the Pepperjack Mac ($6.25). \n\nThe broccoli pesto is served over penne with chicken and sauteed garlic. It was dreadful. The pasta was underdone and overdone, depending on the bite. It was bad news. The chicken was so dry I could have easily mistaken them for breadcrumbs. The pesto was overpowered by garlic only a slight bitterness shined through.\n\nThe pepperjack mac also has monterey jack and asiago cheeses.  It was better than the broccoli pesto. The noodles were cooked evenly and it had a little kick. The jalapenos on top were just terrible, like they were dehydrated or something. Very odd. Otherwise, the first few bites were decent. Then the mac cooled. It quickly became grainy and gross. I grew tired of it in a hurry."

But uninspired name aside, I thought this place was pretty good.\n\nYou get a sense of the hip, bistro vibe a lot of places go for these days, with the walls reminding you in giant letters that their food is locally sourced and sustainable. The crew was all young, but friendly enough and seemed to know what they were doing. \n\nThe menu was large, but I think the macaroni dishes were too few and simple for a place with Mac in the title, but that may not be such a bad thing. There were also traditional Italian pasta selections, as well as some interesting creations that seemed worth trying out.\n\nThe create-your-own pasta feature is a great idea but it seems kinda broken. It's 7.25 for your choice of pasta and sauce to start, 1.95 for a meat choice, and .65 for each additional toppings (from a list of enticing toppings of which you will want many). By the time you've set up a basic dish with only one meat and one topping it's an almost $10 pasta. Meanwhile, the most expensive plates on the menu, with multiple meats and toppings included are only around $11.  This is all a long way of saying that it's a much better value just to pick regular menu item and substitute any toppings you don't like for ones you do.\n\nI got the crazy Alfredo (10.50) : fettuccini pasta with chicken breast, shrimp, Italian sausage, roasted peppers, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and jalape\u00f1os.  The sauce was a little light on flavor and the shrimp were small and not the best quality, but the dish was very large, the ingredients fresh, and overall, quite enjoyable. For the price, I can definitely recommend it.\n\nMy wife got pepper jack Mac and cheese and added bacon. I was kind of jealous. It was a generous portion of elbow pasta, cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and flavorful bacon. I will probably stick to their Mac dishes from now on.\n\nMac Shack is a great place if you feel like eating Italian food, but don't want to spend a lot of money or tip. They have a diverse menu that should offer something for everyone, and service is quick. \n\nPretty solid little pasta joint!"

I normally abscond from heavy carb loading if I'm not competing in a tennis tournament, but, I have to say that I have the biggest weakness for Mac and cheese! Needless to say, I was excited to give this place a shot. With this said it was very difficult for me to keep my hunger pangs at bay, as soon as I entered the establishment! I'm met with the aroma of what I can only call...HEAVENLY...Based on my pleasant experience with the dashing and unusually handsome staff, this place served it up and boy do they know how to do it with quantity in those well proportioned bowls! (^_^) Portions placed on the side however, Mac Shack's  scrumptious menu selection offerings does fall a little more on the bland side. Maybe making their sauces cheesier or flavorful might help because based on what I had, the Philly mac and cheese, I often found myself wishing that I had stowed away some cheese slices from home before walking into mac shack and adding it inconspicuously to my bowl for more cheesy goodness. No one plans for these things and I could've easily asked for more sauce but I had an epiphany. AHA!!! I don't know if it's for health reasons, but perhaps adding less sauce gives you that option of \"having your cake and eating it too\". Overall, the Mac Shack manages to fulfill pasta cravings and then some. If you can look past the bland tastes and less cheesier iterations of your comfort food, you will certainly keep coming back for more of this guilty pleasure. But then again keep in mind that maybe they skimp out on over cheesing so as to offer comfort food in a way that doesn't make you the legendary lake mead beached walrus!"

But the dishes on their menu are WAY better than anything \"I've\" ever put together. So I've made my way through about three fourths of their dishes even with the new ones they've added and I've been pleased EVERY time."

            "review": "Protein portion size is a deal-breaker for me.\n\nJust got takeout for lunch. Ordered a Spinach Salad with add-on shrimp. Discovered the policy for an add-on protein is ONE LARGE SHRIMP. Very disappointed. The manager told me their shrimp costs about $1.10 each. EACH. (That seems to be pretty high-priced shrimp, especially for a one-dollar-sign restaurant on Yelp.) The manager offered, if i returned, to \"give me another shrimp\", as that, evidently, is a non-add-on portion of shrimp. Still disappointed.\n\nThe manager was nice, the service was pleasant, the food was fairly good and quick. (I found the shrimp to be nicely cooked, a little under-seasoned. The spinach salad was nothing to write home about, and the balsamic vinaigrette was not very punchy. My fiance loved his baked wheat pasta with meat sauce, which was well-seasoned and rich) \n\nMore info from the manager. Add-on portion of chicken is 3 oz (6 for entree). Add-on for meatballs is 2 balls. So I guess when you order the create-you-own pasta dish, you get less protein than when you order one of their \"classics\".\n\nBeing a new restaurant, I was told \"they are still working out the kinks\". Well, this is a HUGE kink for me, and I imagine it will be a kink for others. I hope that the policy changes, because the food is good, and I wish the company success (I would love to have quick/cheap Nora's around the corner when I want pasta!)\n\nUPDATE: I also went to their website and submitted a complaint. I received an email the same day from the founder/owner saying \"Thank you so much for your interest in us and I assure you the shrimp policy will be changed first thing in the morning!! I'm sure you know that this was only our second day being open, and we are trying really hard to offer a top quality quick serve pasta concept.\"\n\nSo they get another star from me, for being cool and understanding. I WILL go back now to see if that really happened, and if so, then they may get another star!\n\nUpdate 2: it seems they have NOT changed their protein sizes. so their owner lied. not cool."

And frankly, I'M NOT A COOK; so that already says alot!\n\nOne great part of their menu was that their mac and cheese. It was pretty delish. Cheesy and crispy (from the baked topping). \nI wish wish WISH they served garlic bread/toast/something with the pasta. Instead was some sweet roll. WEIRD.\n\nOther than the menu, the ambiance was nice. Pretty classy with great panoramic pictures of farms (ala wheat ala pasta).\n\nIf there was one major suggestion I could make to the owner, it would be to: INVEST IN REAL UTENSILS!!!!!!!!! \n----- Please, someone, tell the owners this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIt was odd to be drinking wine and eating $8 pasta with a plastic fork and knife. Classy place with plastic utensils...LIKE, REALLY???!!!!???!"

Just the name Mac Shack is strong and very straight forward.\n\nOne night me and the BF were looking for salad for our resolution diet. We've been passing by Mac Shack and finally decide to try it. It was around 820pm and mind you they close at 9pm. So, I was worried they'd deny us of service. But the moment we walked in.. First things first they greeted us. In other words, the didn't mind at all to serve us for their last remaining minutes.\n\nCool thing was the menu was pretty \"self-explanatory\". They had a section of create-your-own pasta and a section of creations of their own.\n\nI created my own. Bow tie pasta with spicy red sauce. The spice was perfect. I added ricotta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and zucchini. Cool thing is, if you're not sure what any of those ingredients look like.. They have physical samples right underneath a glass, which is conveniently the cash register table. It's great for the visual learners :). I'm not a big wine fan but they do serve it. And afterwards they have tootsie pops on your way out.\n\nThe seating is plenty. There's even outdoor seating, although it's been too cold lately, I'd love to sit next to the orange tree. But the inside art work is gunna do for now. Parking is also plenty. \n\nOnce again, another place of many possibilities specifically with pasta."
