Dined in last night and had the yellowtail sashimi and blackened cod! OMG!  Both are absolutely out of this world.  The decor and service is second to none!  Make a reservation but be prepared, it does get pricey!  Especially with a group or even a date!  Well worth it!"

Not that I have anything against the french, but i came to a japaneses restaurant for a reason.\r\nAnyhow, YES, go here if you have the chance and some extra $. plan to spend 50-75$/person."

I could pass on the sushi there as I find it to not be up to par for their prices. My favorite dish there is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. So simple yet so delicious. The miso cod is also delicious but everyone does that dish. Also try their Matsuhisa martini. It has ginger and cucumber infused vodka and is very refreshing.\n\nI secretely made it my goal to eat at every Nobu worlwide. They need to stop opening new ones because I'm falling behind."

No matter where I go it always comes back to Nobu--Bahamas, New York, Malibu, Las Vegas...  Every single location I've been to has provided a first-class sushi experience.\n\nThe Las Vegas folks were especially nice - particularly since I was playing those Wheel of Fortune machines again and much to my husband's dismay we missed our reservation and they gave our table away.  As soon as we arrived, they moved us to the top of the list for the sushi bar - on one of their busiest nights.  Thank you Nobu Las Vegas team.\n\nPROS:\n- Incredible selection of sushi, dinners, etc.\n- A great place to meet up at the sushi bar or to have the full first class dinner experience\n- The best fresh fish, most unique combinations (my fav - yellow tail sashimi with japlapeno...  yum, I have dreams about this)\n\nCONS:\n- Pricey\n- Maybe a bit pretentious (according to my husband), but I disagree"

We decided to both do the 5, or was it 6 course meal? And my goodness, it was amazing! Everything melted in my mouth, I remember we couldn't finish the last two courses and went straight to dessert. I am not a big fan of fishy sushi seaweed, and one of the dishes brought was some kind of cucumber roll, which I have tried at other places, and spit it back out. I'm so picky.

I particularly recommend the tuna and jalapeno sashimi (and I don't normally eat raw fish, but I wasn't going to pass it up this time) and the cod that comes on a lettuce leaf with a little shredded, toasted phyllo on top. \n\nOur waiter was patient with us, and helped us decide even though we were a bit clueless. The service is fast once you make up your mind about what to eat; and we ordered in waves, which the kitchen was fine with. \n\nThe only reason this wasn't a 5-star experience is that the room is small, crowded, dark, and noisy. We were literally reading the menus with the lights from our cellphones. The price of everything probably also weighs into my decision not to give the place 5 stars. For five of us to eat enough not to be starving but not to be totally full either was more than $300, and that includes one drink apiece."

            "review": "I have been to Nobu probably 5 times over the last 12 years,,, for business meetings and such,,,. Even though I don't like it, no choice - but at least i don't have to pay...\n\nOK, maybe the first time was fine. I didn't know much about Japanese food back then. So, sashimi with jalape\u00f1o/sesame oil, fish with some sort of Chinese sauce, and edamame were just fine. \n\nHowever, as I get to know more about Japanese food, this place seems to be just so-so,,, especially for me,, i have spent a lot of time visiting Japan lately and now I think I know what is good and what is bad. (All my Japanese friends say Nobu is FAKE and it is all about Hollywood celeb and media who tries to hype this place up. I heard it is out of Michelin rating in Tokyo this year. And Tokyo store is the best of all Nobu,,, so, you know what this means).\n\nI mean, sashimi is ok. Sushi is not that special - sumeshi (sushi rice ball) isn't that good. Good sushi rice ball is a little sticky outside and super soft inside with mild, almost fruity vinegar flavor. Good sushi never fall apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. It requires experience and technique. Or maybe they use cheap rice from California.\n\nBut for sure, sushi chef here isn't there yet. Maybe they aren't trained in Japan. Fake. \n\nAnyway, this place is waaaaaaay overrated and overpriced. I give their food probably 3.5 stars,,, but the price!! WAAAY TOOOOO EXPENSIVE!\n\nIs it romantic? Maybe yes for those who talk loud and keep spitting rice out of your mouth. Not for me. This place is LOUD.\n\nI guess people go there to show off. Have you talked to your friends how much $$$$ you spent at Nobu? Listen to your mind. I am sure you have. \n\nThis restaurant makes you feel you are celebrity - and this is pretty much it is all about.\n\nIf you like to eat good sushi - get a cab and go to Kabuto. If you like these rolls and wired sashimi, go to Sen of Japan to save a lot of money. If you like to eat sea bass with black bean sauce, go to Chinese restaurants. \n\nThis ain't year of 2000 - we have lots more to choose in LV today. Get real!"

Keep in mind that if you're thinking on ordering your basic California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, etc.. it'll be a waist of your money. Some of the things I tried were the Miso Black Cod, Yellowtail sashimi with jalape\u00f1o & Barracuda sashimi...all were amazing by the way.  Don't forget to try their saki as well, a bit expensive but worth every penny.  I've eaten here twice and I can see myself coming back for more."

            "review": "I have to say that I was skeptical at first - I don't like the idea of paying so much at a sushi place. But my boyfriend and I were in Vegas with friends so the good company was what brought us in. \n\nFor those who want a simple yes/no - YES, if you're looking for a high end place to try and you enjoy sushi than I think Nobu is one of those rare places that's worth it. \n\nOur party of 8 didn't really know what we wanted, so our amazing waiter suggested that he could pick out an assortment of dishes based on our budget. At $100 a person, he said he could give us the Grand Prix. We had dish after dish that included sushi rolls, black cod, \ncreamy spicy crab, etc. Other people have mentioned the Black Cod - I would just add that my boyfriend made a comment while eating it that every human should taste this succulent piece of ocean nectar. that cod was that good. \n\nOne person in our group was vegetarian, and I have to say he was getting some awesome custom dishes! SO MANY OPTIONS FOR VEGETARIANS!\n\nThe food was great to say the least. The service was excellent, and the ambiance was lively yet relaxed. There was honestly nothing to complain about. Since you're reading this review, I assume you don't mind the price point as long as its worth it. I would tell you that yes, it's worth it."

Followed by the shrimp tempura roll and lobster ceviche, both were good. I wouldn't say anything spectacular but good nevertheless. The best for last, the black cod miso lettuce wrap was very good. It's sweet, buttery, hot & cold, soft & crunchy. The dish was the highlight of the evening. The GF enjoyed the miso immensely. We also had the bento box dessert, simple but good. Service was good to us.\n\nBeing Nobu, you pay a pretty penny for a small amount of food. Ok...you'll drop a few bills here. But it's worth going to, esp. if you never been."

            "review": "We could never get reservations whenever we were in New York so we decided to jump at the chance to go to the Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino (There's also one at Caesar's). And the food lived up to all the hype as every dish was an orchestra of flavors and perfectly cooked/sliced proteins. \n\nFor instance when biting into the barracuda sashimi you first taste the tartness of the yuzu which is then overcome by the fattiness of the fish and the bread crumbs and finally you are hit by the small crunchy garlic chips. \n\nThe wait staff is very attentive and they ask that you simply answer a couple of questions about preferences and price points and they then come up with a tasting menu. We gave them no restrictions and what came out of the kitchen for about $120 per person was amazing. \n\nOur impromptu tasting menu included two of Nobu's iconic dishes -- miso-glazed black cod and the jalapeno yellowtail. Like the barracuda, both of these dishes also had several flavor profiles developing on the taste buds. There were also several other dishes and a full plate of sushi, each of which would be the best in almost any city.\n\nOur server, I believe she said her name was Ti, was also a highlight as she showed an honest exuberance and pride in the food that she was serving, which made us even more excited to try it.\n\nFor drinks, my wife had a respectable cucumber martini and I had an interesting version of the Sidecar -- an Old School drink but with yuzu being used to create the tartness.\n\nOne warning: The dining room is not the quiet, reverential temple that many high-end restaurants foster. There is an energy to the place which befits the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel."

It is too cool, and is what is going to bring me back to Vegas before too long.  \n\nWhich brings me to Nobu, the worldwide chain of really great Japanese restaurants.    It was way too loud and way too crowded, but I had some of the most amazing food there Friday night.  I am still dreaming about the incredible mushroom salad, with like 10 different kinds of mushrooms, and the \"live\" scallops, the miso cod and the excellent spicy tempura rock shrimp.    And the Chablis we ordered - I wish I could remember the name - was outstanding.  \n\nTruly a great meal, with some great company.

            "review": "Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a huge self-admitted sushi addict and my husband is Peruvian, so Nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  Aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice. \n\nWe started out with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  Yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and I've had a similar dish at several excellent Bay Area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that I've had. The sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome added bonus (honestly, I've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in Vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise. \n\nNext, we tried the Tiradito Nobu Style with some type of halibut like fish.  Now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  My husband says this is exactly what Tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in Peru.  It was amazing.\n\nWe then moved on to the Black Cod Miso next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that I was underwhelmed by.  I know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at Nobu, but I've had a very similar dish at both Morimoto Napa and at Hyakumi at Cesar's Palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that I have come to expect from the dish. The flavor was right on, and if I'd never had black cod before, I would have loved it.  \n\nSo, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the New Style Salmon Sashimi (new style because it's served with ginger, and some other amazing deliciousnesss that I can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the Toro Green Onion Maki (Cut).  They were both amazing. \n\nWhat shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two desserts we had were.  We tried the bento box, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea ice cream, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger ice cream.  I don't know if anyone else finds some green tea ice cream to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this ice cream was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  The warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger ice cream was a highlight of my whole trip to Vegas.  (And I'm not really a dessert person)\n\nOkay, this review is way too long, and I didn't even mention the impeccable service.  I can't wait to go back and wish there was a Nobu in the Bay Area."

It reflects me so I was bothered, I tried to work it out with the waiter bc I for one was not going to have us pay for HIS mistakes. he was only able to comp 2 oz of the kobe and remove half of the cod.. usually service can ruin a rating but I love the food and forgive the guy, must've been one of those days."

Our favorites are the black cod and the jalapeno sashimi. The sashimi is to DIE for. I live in the SF Bay Area where we have a million sushi joints and I have yet to find sashimi as wonderful as Nobu's - please if someone knows of a place let me know because I crave yummy sashimi. The spicy miso lotus chips with big eye tuna is delish too! Actually, we have been happy with everything we have tried. \n\nNobu is definitely on the pricey side but so worth every penny. We are always sure to take our time with our meal and savor every bite! Our bill is usually anywhere from $80 (no alcohol) to $120 (with alcohol). The other great thing is that all the wait staff work together so your plates are constantly cleared and your table cleaned. They even fold your napkin for you if you get up from the table. \n\nThe only reason why I give Nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because every so often we will get a waiter who is pompous and thinks his shit doesn't stink, which is really unfortunate because most of the wait staff is really great!

The menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. We decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). We chose the Lobster Ceviche, Big Eye Tuna Tempura Roll and the Nobu Style Lobster Tacos to start. The tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. These composed the \"cold\" dishes that Nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included Kobe Beef Tataki style, Black Cod with Miso as well as some Sashimi. The Kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the Cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. Looking at the menu now I'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but I remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like I got real value from our money. The atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. The food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. Sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it."

            "review": "We came here New Years Eve to celebrate! \nThe service was outstanding! more attentive than NOBU in Japan which I had a pleasure of experiencing on a work trip last month. Thank you (\u3069\u3046\u3082 \u6709\u96e3\u3046 \u5fa1\u5ea7\u3044\u307e\u3059) so much Adrienne. The Ambiance is great, dim lighting lighting makes for a very romantic evening for diners. You might get louder or more obnoxious dining group sitting perhaps close by which can negatively impact the atmosphere, but no way to really control that and after all we are in VEGAS!\nWe could not decide what we wanted to eat and decided to just set a budget per person and let the server bring us whatever her wonderful self thought would wow us.(Adrienne DID AMAZING!!!)\n\n1. Edamame / Shishito Peppers: I rarely eat shishito peppers but these were fantastic! not hot ( guess I got lucky since I can't deal with HOT ) and a little sweet with the sauce. Edamame? its Edamame.......\n\n2. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalape\u00f1o and Cilantro\nThe Cilantro on with each piece was interesting but complimented the flavors greatly. I really enjoyed this and would order this again next time.\n\n3.Live Scallop:\nThinly sliced scallop served in the tiradito-style with peruvian flavors of cilantro, spice and Japanese fusion elements. The abductor is also thinly sliced on the plate, giving contrasting flavor and texture. Although good I enjoyed the Yellowtail more than this dish. On a side note... Did someone spill the Yuzu on this dish? little overwhelming....\n\n4. Black Cod Miso in Lettuce Butter Cups: This was one of my favorite dishes of the night ( Dessert got the number one spot sorry). This is a must eat dish and I will return to experience this one again! mmm my mouth is watering for this one right now. I would suggest to tone down the sugar.\n\n5. Kurobuta Pork Belly Skewers and Chicken wings:\n The pork was also one of my favorite things the whole night but at that time I haven't had any dessert yet. Amazing Kurobuta Pork Belly that was braised to absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfection, although a little fatty, but people tend to enjoy the fat so I can't complain. \n\n6. Toro Blue Fin and Salmon which was actually two dishes. I really enjoyed the Toro more than the salmon maybe due to the fact I dislike salmon in raw form. I believe both of these dishes were so so, I rather eat the fish plain. Although to give it justice each piece had amazing flavor with different textures from the fish, capers,wasabi and garlic chips.\n\n7: King Crab with brown sugar? and cherry tomatoes and shiso leaf:\n Truthfully I would not order this dish If I were to come back due to the fact I can go to many Vegas buffets and devour crab legs for hours. This was nothing to write home about. \n\n8. Sushi Platter with California Roll, Uni that was so fresh I could eat it everyday, Yakitori Unagi, And Salmon. Everything was great except the rice... this was a let down... it was hard and dry. I am surprised at the sushi chef for making nigiri with this rice.\n\n9. Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki:\nThis dish was great but after eating a ton of wagyu in Japan your palette gets you and you end up craving that melt in your mouth amazingness you just don't have with any other type of beef. Maybe just stick with the Uni! haha......\n\n10. Beef Carpaccio:\nWhat can I say? this is as good as it gets people! eat it! enjoy it!\nAlthough if you are looking for good Beef Carpaccio District One on Spring Mountain and Jones has some killer Carpaccio.\n\n11. Fried Rock Shrimp something something something:\nWell it was shrimp... it was very well presented and came to the table in a rock pot still sizzling. Lets just go to Hot N' Juicy Crawfish. \n\n12. Assortment of Desserts: \n The desserts just kept coming, honestly this was what I came here for and If it wasn't for my brother and friend I would of just ordered every single dessert item on the menu and that would of been it. 4 courses of desserts after all the entrees had finished. The highlights included a cucumber shaved ice to die for with Yuzu syrup which they pour on the ice at your table with fresh berries, young coconut and cantaloupe sorbet did I mention it had STAR FRUIT ON TOP!!! I haven't had starfruit since I was a child living in Hawaii. Second was a Special New Years Eve only Sizzle in your mouth palette zapping of amazingness dessert it was Fuji Apple and champagne semifreddo (what word was that?) with apple cake crumble with POP ROCKS, yes I fucking said that right!!!! It had pop rocks in the cake crumble what dessert have you ever had with pop rocks plain genius! that's not it! It also had freeze dried kiwi and pineapples with dulce glaze finished with champagne foam and apple chips. They really should keep that one on the menu. Third was Pear Toban w/ gingerbread stout cake w/ poached pears in orange syrup w/ toasted cinnamon ice cream and candied black walnuts, this one was a warm \"homey\" dessert but not the highlight it was presented very well on a clay looking pot wit"

While Kobe beef may be hard to mess up (though certainly not impossible :P), Nobu delivers it perfectly in several different preparations. From tartar, to seared fillet, to wok fried, it's always decadent and flavorful. The sushi is ridiculously fresh and well presented, as are the salads and desserts. The staff does just an amazing job describing every ingredient in every course in great detail, explaining where everything is grown, what flavors it's chosen for, and it's history. Simply amazing. \n\nTheir Sake list is diverse and excellent, and Nobu has the best cold Sakes I've ever had. I've had the chance to have some blind horizontal tastings, and Yk-35 always wound up as being my favorite."

Out of the three, I'd have to say NY was the best and this one the least-best.  I say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and Nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  You cant go wrong with Nobu- but I did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.\n\nSo, of course of course you have to get the Miso Cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. In addition to the cod, I also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the hearts of palm salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a miso soup.  If you've read my Nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini I had was perfect (which is why I had 3), so understandably I was excited to have it again.  However, the one I received at Nobu Vegas was waaaaay to strong, and I had to request additional lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  My other major gripe was the hearts of palm salad.  I specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same hearts of palm salad with jalapeno dressing they serve at Nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  WRONG.  That salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  It tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at Nobu 57.  And, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite I swear I smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  Oh, and not to mention the fact that it was TWENTY DOLLARS.  Um, yea...skip that one.  The miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.\n\nSo, even with my complaints I still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  Maybe not as good as Nobu 57, but still the best Japanese restaraunt in Vegas, definitely."

We dolled up, drove to the Hard Rock where there is valet parking, and walked into the center of the first floor where this ridiculously delicious restaurant is located.\n\nService-Great! Everyone was really attentive. I always had my water filled, any finished dishes cleared off within the minute. The food came in really good timing as well. I was starving going in and I didn't have to wait. Although coming from a restaurant like this I didn't expect anything less.\n\nThe decor is really comfy and not as fancy as I'd originally thought (or the other Nobu restaurants apparently). You can definitely get away with begin pretty casual or dressing up your attire. While there were only small groups there they had some large tables and some hidden rooms for even larger groups so if you need to bring a lot of people it seems as thought they'd be able to accommodate for more people.\n\nNow onto the best part of all! Fooood is so worth the price!!\nDessert: lemme start with this one because I cannot get over the delicious trio of soy caramel, miso apple cinnamon donuts and a really delicious HOME MADE ice cream with toasted pecans. Their pastry chef changes the dessert menu every season to go with what's in season which means I'm going to have to come here every season :)\n\nApart from that we enjoyed the black cod miso, eggplant miso (best i've ever had, decent portion but very rich), yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (not spicy and very fresh!), japanese snapper dry miso (the garlic chips added great texture but the citrus oil sauce was too overpowering) and the shiitake mushroom salad (very strong citrus vinaigrette but delicious mushrooms to make up for it)\n\nAwesome experience and a high price but definitely worth it :D"

I had two full plates of sushi in front of me for almost 10 minutes before anyone else got what they ordered.

How do you cheap out on these disposable splinters of firewood?  Such a cheap item to upgrade, instead it totally ruined the dinner for the table...it was like going to a good steak house and being given a plastic knife to cut your filet.\n\nTwo at the table were somehow offered dessert while the rest of us never even saw the menu or heard the offerings, -1 again for lack of service.\n\nNot much of a social scene for what I was expecting at the Hard Rock, but still one of the better options in Vegas for sushi. \n\nAbout half the price of Massa, but you sacrifice the service a little bit.

The waiter tempted us with the $150 Omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at Nobu, we went with the cheaper Omakase. The dishes (as best as I can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)\n\n1) Toro with Spicy Miso and Caviar - Wow, definitely one of the highlights of the Omakase. Super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. OMG so good. There was an interesting tiny Japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.\n\n2) Hawaiian Red Snapper Sashimi - Very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . Not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.\n\n3) Kampachi and Tasmanian Trout Sashimi - Super exotic and tasty. I didn't even know what Kampachi was until I looked it up. Apparently it's Hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the Kona coast of the Big Island. The trout was also very good. It looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. Served with a nice miso-based sauce (I think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.\n\n4) Black Cod w/ Miso - This dish really did live up to the hype. I was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the Omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 Omakase since it's a very popular dish. OMG so good. Such delicate flavors and texture. Amazing. I normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. The cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. Wow, this is a must try if you come to Nobu.\n\n5) Beef Tenderloin w/ Shiitake mushroom and asparagus - I didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. It was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. It is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.\n\n6) Nigiri Sushi Platter - Delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces I normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. Tuna (best I've had in awhile), Japanese snapper, Aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. Mmm\n\n7) Miso Soup w/ Clams - Pretty standard miso soup with a few clams inside. The clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. I cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;P\n\n8) Flourless Chocolate Cake w/ Green Tea Ice Cream - A generous portion served in a cute bento box. Nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. The cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. Yum!\n\nA pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. I thought it was good value to try many dishes, but I haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. Many tables around us also ordered the Omakase, as I heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. I over heard a table of French tourists behind us ordering California rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. Sigh, what a waste.\n\nI would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. The rest is basically traditional Japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at Nobu. Service was good, polite, and attentive. It was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. Weird.\n\nThe decor is basic, but nothing too special. The sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. My parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. When we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. Ten minutes later, they were ready. Better to come early though, or your Omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. Ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.\n\nI think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. Otherwise, nearly flawless.\n\nIf I ever return for a special occasion, I will definitely need to try the $150 Omakase. With the economy in shambles, I kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. Fortunately, my parents picked up the tab tonight as I had paid last night at the Painted Pony. Maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like Gray's Papaya. ;P"

            "review": "So, as many of these reviews state, \"Nobu is expensive.\" Yes, but it is exactly what an expensive restaurant should be. High quality, professional service and top of the line food. I have eaten at Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino in Vegas 3 times now and I find it excellent. \n\nMy average bill per person has been about $150. This is including a $60 bottle of saki and a couple of $15 martini's. Without drinks, my wife and I probably would have spend about $100-$120 each. This is also without trying to go cheap. If you wanted to eat here on a budget, it would be completely possible to order a couple of $12-$15 Sushi rolls and a couple of $12-$15 skewers and get out of there with a tab that runs about $60 or $70. However, in my opinion that would be defeating the purpose because while you can budget yourself into turning this place into a typical sushi bar, the real goods and their signature dishes that separate them from the rest are the more expensive plates. \n\nTheir main signature dish is their yellowtail- jalepeno sashimi. Definitely an appetizer portion, but very tasty if you like sashimi. My personal favorite is their blackened cod in a butter-lettuce wrap. The last time I was there it was not listed on the menu but when I mentioned it they knew exactly what I was talking about and whipped it up for us. Also an appetizer portion, but very different and very good. The fish literally melts in your mouth. Another recommendation is the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. It's sort of a beef filled pot-sticker that is cooked to perfection. The beef is imported either from Japan or from Australia, depending on which one you decide to go with, and comes with an incredible dipping sauce. A little more filling of an order as well. Their sushi rolls are good, but nothing you can't get at another place that makes good sushi. However, I recommend getting a couple rolls to get yourself filled up then get a couple of their specials in order to keep your cost reasonable. \n\nThe service is great. Then waiters and waitresses have a good attitude and they know the menu like the back of their hand. If you just tell them what you're feeling they can put together a meal that works for you. There is someone coming by to fill up your water or bring you another drink every time you need it and they all have been well trained in how to communicate at a high end table. \n\nAs much as I like to branch out and try new restaurants, this place is always going to be hard for me to pass up when I am in town."

By asking some simple questions regarding likes and dislikes, dishes came out selected for us not only looked artful but we were treated to a fantastic assortment of flavors.  If you are willing to pay the money and allow the chef to select your dishes, I would recommend to dine this way.  The enjoyment of good company and great food is the only way to go."

Let me know just preface this by saying, this place should not tote itself as a Japanese restaurant because most people should realize, this isn't. Sure, it's got sushi and stuff but no dice. If you can move past that, then you may enjoy this place.\n\nTuna tataki -This is good. Lightly seared but has a good taste to it\nYellowtail Jalapeno -I'm not a fan of spicy but this does add a nice kick to the yellowtail.\nBlack Cod Miso - This was surprisingly really good. The fish was cooked wonderfully; just the right amount of crisp but moist/juicy flavor to it. \nAssorted sushi -This is the most standard dish that you can get at any sushi joint, for 1/8 the price.\nMiso Soup -I'm only commenting about this because I love how they call it \"sipping soup\" so at first you think you're getting something special...only to realize it's miso soup.\nMochi was pretty delicious but I'm sure this was purchased at your local Trader Joes or Mitsuwa.\n\nAnyhow, it's worth stopping by to check out the d\u00e9cor and if it's restaurant week. I would consider this place Asian fusion more than Japanese but eh, if you're craving Asian food and you're staying at the Hard Rock, this is gonna be your best (and only) bet."

If your pocket book is a little tight this is not the place I would recommend you to go. \n\nCold Dishes: \nSpecial: Toro (don't remember what he listed as the garnishes, but it is shown on my pics.  I think this dish was just a little salty. Once, you add all the dressing on top, I like to taste the fish, since it is fresh.)\nKelp Salad 13 (this tasted so fresh, added just a little lemon on top of it.  Also, helped w/cleaning the palette for the next course) \nSea Urchin 16 (this is from Santa Barbara, CA which is normally where every Japanese restaurant from the west coast gets there uni from.  Hmmm..this just tasted like any uni I would have gotten at another bay area restaurant probably no more than 12.00.  Oh well, I do love my uni. \n\nHot Dishes: \nBlack Cod Miso 37  (this was cooked well and the miso glaze on top was just right) \n\nGeez I forget the server's name, but he was really great!  Knowledgeable about his fish and the menu.  Very upscale and modern experience.  This is the 2nd Nobu location I have been to, first was in Hong Kong.  If you like fresh fish w/a twist of fresh ingredients, you just have to come here and experience the taste.  But don't come here if you are looking for affordable specialty sushi rolls, this is not that type of place.  This was the first time my friend had gone to this restaurant, she said it was the best Japanese restaurant she has ever been to.  I was so pleased to have taken her there 1st.  Hope they do open up in San Francisco soon!"

My husband and I were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino on our honeymoon, and received a gift card to Nobu, at our request, from my sister-in-law.  I've heard nothing but good things, and they were ALL true.  We chose the OMAKASE menu option.  We had 9 courses EACH, and the dessert came with THREE different items, for each of us.  We spent just under $400 after the tip for both of us, and it was WORTH EVERY PENNY.  The service and food was absolutely impeccable.  Our server was AMAZING.  The manager came out to our table personally and presented us with the gift card my sister-in-law had purchased prior, over the phone.  He also provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne.  I am terrible at naming cuisine that I don't normally eat, so can't remember specifically all items we had, but for certain, the YELLOWTAIL TARTARE W/ CAVIAR, the MUSHROOM SOUP, the BLACK COD w/ MISO, the WAGYU BEEF and the CHOCOLATE MOLTEN CAKE, GREEN TEA ICE CREAM AND CAPPUCINO desserts were so delicious.  I have not one bad thing to say about the food or service at this place.  Nobu at the Hard Rock is a GEM in the middle of a loud and crazy city.  This meal was the highlight of our dining experience on our week-long honeymoon in Vegas.  I would eat here every single day if I could."

When I saw the $99 Groupon plus the 20% off Groupon was offering plus my wife's B'Day to celebrate there, I knew the stars were aligned.  Could it live up to reputation?\nThe food: The Groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. The meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. A very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. The first course was yellowtail tuna with jalapeno and cilantro. The tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. It was very tasty and different than yellowtail that I have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. Things got even better after that. The next dish was rock shrimp tempura with a creamy spicy sauce. Wow, was that good! Not like any tempura I have eaten before. Very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. And the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. A great dish. And a huge portion. By its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. This was followed by the Alaskan Black Cod with Miso. Another outstanding dish. The fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a California roll. This was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. Last course, dessert. I photographed the plate. A beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). The food rates 5 stars plus.\nThe service: As soon as we were seated, our server, Albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. Throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. They made us feel very welcome. Our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. The table was cleared promptly. The food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. The service was 5 stars plus.\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. However, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. We were there on a Monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  But our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. If the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. Not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. At best, 3 stars for ambiance.\nValue: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. I would do it again in a heartbeat. But I would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or I would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out)."

            "review": "I've read about celebrities going to Nobu.  My friend talked about Nobu like it was a god of sorts.  When we found out we had a table waiting for us at Nobu, I was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  We ordered: The miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a soft shell crab roll, the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer, the mushroom salad, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  To drink I had the cucumber martini.  It was seriously one of the best drinks I have ever had.  It tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  Unfortunately our positive experience ended there.  After waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  We sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  I glanced at the menus, waited.  Our waiter came by and I asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  We had no water, and no menus.  Finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"We're a little short on menus.\"  We shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  We asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  We finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos.  Before I could order anything else, he rushes off.  The next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos.  Pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  I can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll.  The vegetable cut roll was pretty good, I mean, steamed vegetables, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  The mushroom salad was pretty gross.  The mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  The sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  Everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  Everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  Mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  When the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  His response?  \"No you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  I secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in San Francisco for a quarter of the price.  Overall verdict:  Skip it.  The atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  The Pros: The cucumber martini was super good."

I eat at incredible places about 3-4 times a MONTH! I dont care about cost either. Good sushi is worth it to me! \n\nOkay, that being said... I would give Nobu a 3.5 stars if that were possible. Then again, the only reason I'd bring it up by half would be the friendly servers and great decor. \n\nNow, for the sushi... like someone said below recently, I was expecting to be WOWED. I've eaten some amazing food in Vegas and hoped this was going to blow those other places out of the water. But this was not to be unfortunately. Now, I don't know if it's because we're more into nigiri & sashimi and we don't go the hot meal route very often. Either way, I was just not impressed. We ordered red snapper sashimi which came as big slabs of flavorless fish, no presentation & really no taste either. Next was spanish mackerel, usually my fave. This too was bland & boring. Then I ordered unagi, which as most sushi fans know takes a while to get to you when they bake it fresh. This was brought to me almost before the words came out of my mouth! Fast service yes... but how did he bake it so fast? I discovered the answer when I noticed a plateful of it sitting on top of the little oven already done & waiting. Boo!! This caused it to be lukewarm when it arrived. Finished off with rock shrimp tempura because at this point we really just wanted out of there realizing that if we saved up what money we'd normally spend, that we could go to one of our fave places soon to make up for it! \n\nRock shrimp tempura was good, I can't lie. But it was also nothing special. Oh!! And something that really bugged me & my dining partner was that the chef wasn't very good at making his rice stick together tight! It fell apart the second you touched it. :( \n\nSo to sum up...\n\n1 point for service, 1 point for ambiance and 1 point for food/taste.I do have to say the the fish did taste fresh & the quality seemed safe & good. However,  will I go back? Ehh... I would if someone else was buying. But I will never seek it out on my own again I'm sad to say."

Even none fish lovers would love this cod\n\nIt's a hustle and bustle place, I couldn't tell you who our actually waiter was  but they make sure the courses keep moving."

The service was phenomenal! \n\nOur theme of the weekend turned out to be LMFAO's 'Sorry for Party Rockin' and when we told our server he let us keep our zen rocks, get it? Rocking! Aw, good times.\n\nMust haves:\n- Black Cod with Miso \n- Toro Sashimi (Shout out to our waiter who helped me trick my friends who were squimish about trying fatty Bluefin tuna belly. He told them it was compliments of the chef. After they fell in love with it we told them the truth and enjoyed a good laugh about it.)\n- Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno\n- Spicy Tuna Rolls \n- Dessert: The chef's tasting platter was so yummy that someone swooped on a part of mine. They even put candles on it for the girls birthdays.\n\nI would also like to note that the presentation of dishes was extremely entertaining. Their descriptions are as magical as the flavors. I want to give a special thanks to the server who served Jessica H.'s dish with such an amazing description that it left the entire table wishing we had ordered chicken teriyaki.\n\nAt this point I must admit that our two large Daigijo sakes prevent me from making any other recommendations. I can honestly say that the food and service were amazing and the tab was worth every penny. I cannot wait to go back or perhaps try the NYC location.\n\nSide Bar:\n\nBathroom situation: I hated that the bathroom was outside the restaurant and is shared with the not so lovely patrons of Rehab Day Club. At least Hard Rock was nice enough to install a syringe disposal. \n\nOn the bright side we also found out that Nobu will be opening a location at Cesar's Palace, which I think will be a much better fit for this fabulous culinary experience.\n\nThe table next to us was doing Omakase style. So jelly, it looked amazing! When I go to the Cesar's location I will be doing Omakase."

They have lots of \"signiture\" dishes and they always have a \"new\" or \"special\" item or two on their menu. here's a little secret, they have quite a few other \"signiture\" items that they do not even place on their menu, be sure to ask your server about a few of the great items not listed such as the black miso glazed lettuce cups. The place has an up-beat vibe, modern decor and great music playing, also some of the best people watching in town. It's also VERY common to run into celebs dining there as well. It's a little bit pricy, expect to pay at least $100 per person with a couple of cocktails each(that's prob on the low side to be honest), my last visit cost me over $700 for 3 people but worth every penny, I have paid more at other places in the past for FAR FAR less. As with most any place Fri and Sat evening are their busiest, reservations at peak dining hours 8:00-10:00pm on these nights usually book up 3 weeks in advance so make sure you plan ahead.\n\nSide note; I have eaten at both the Nobu in LA and Miami and neither of them compare to the one in Vegas, I'm really not sure why??? I would give LA 4 Stars and Miami 3 Stars. If you had a mediocre or bad experience at another Nobu give the one inside the Hard Rock in Vegas a shot, you will be delighted."

You will not get either one at Nobu. I came here the other night treating an unemployed friend for dinner, WHAT A SHAM.\nI asked the sushi \"chef\" what is good that day and he recommended the king crab roll. We said ok and this little roll came out and the taste was simply ok. I was not impressed at all. I was actually quite annoyed. I ordered some Uni and monkfish liver. Now when I order monkfish liver at any other sushi spot, I either get 2 pieces of sushi or a few medallion sized sashimi. At Nobu, I got one medallion-sized piece on a gigantic plate that was covered in this peach sauce. I was becoming rather bored and none of this tiny shit was fulfilling my appetite. I asked the chef what he has that's unusual and off the menu. He said the yellowtail or white tuna, you know, cuz NO other sushi place has that! I told him something a little more unique and he just didn't know what to offer. Finally he said live octopus. I ordered it and it just kinda arrived in front of me. I imagined it would've been prepared in front of me or shown to me before cutting it.. anything. I have no idea where it came from or how it looked. It was drenched in some sort of clear vinegar-like sauce with green stuff and all I tasted was this crap all over it. \nI got the bill and almost ran the hell out! It was $198. FOR THAT CRAP! We ordered 4 lychee martinis which were good, not worth $56 for 4 of them.  TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS for the crab roll! $25 for the octopuss! $15 for the uni. I payed in absolute anger and disgust, left a 20% tip and got the hell out of there. \nHonestly, I am a harsh critic, I admit that. HOWEVER, I feel financially raped by this place and am losing sleep over it. The food was SO not worth it. Anyone who knows sushi really well wouldn't be caught in this lame over-priced trap. It should be illegal to serve crap sushi covered in taste bud-overdose sauce! I will never EVER go near Nobu again and will warn people waiting to not bother. \nHere's a big middle finger to Nobu nationwide."

Hard Rock Hotel is the loudest hotel/casino in all of Vegas so it is a bit of a given that a place inside would be loud as well. The staff is a bit ridiculous but we just chalked it up to that being part of the show. The staff will try and strong arm you into letting them order for you. Just stand your ground and go for what you want. Also, they will offer you an $11 bottle of Fiji water right off the bat. Smile and refuse and get some free tap water instead.\nPros - have I mentioned the Black Cod Miso? The best thing I have ever had pass my lips. The people watching is top notch really every meal on a Vegas vacation should be a dinner and a show. The show at Nobu is one of the best. With the spouse swapping to my left and the wrestling over who picked up the check to my 1 o'clock (no kidding a half nelson and a headlock/nuggie was used) I was laughing a majority of the time.

I got both the Toro & Caviar dish and the Live Scallops. Yes. I really did pay $40 for the Toro and Caviar. Was it worth it? At least once. All of their normal sushi stuff was fresh and good, but to be honest, there are a million other sushi places that offer fresh, raw fish for a lot cheaper. So my suggestion? If you are going to go there, make sure to try at least a couple of the specialty dishes.\n\nDecor seemed fine...I was more interested in the lightning hands with uber sharp knife sushi chef. He was not only super cool to watch, but also offered some superb suggestions, even though he clearly only understood a tiny bit of english. Ultra attentive wait staff...maybe even a little too attentive, but I think that is because chairs are so close together at the sushi bar that you can't have more than 1 plate in front of you at a time. In other words, if you didn't have an ultra-attentive wait staff, you wouldn't be able to order more food.\n\nWhat keeps this place from 5 stars? PRICE. Wicked expensive. Like super-wicked. I know you expect to pay a bunch for good sushi, but this is pretty high. Drinks run $15, specialty items run $20-$40, and any other nigiri hangs at around $10. Though, you should be scared when you notice the no price dillio on their website.I had a great meal for sure, but I don't know if it would be worth $130 again.\n\nI went alone, and didn't feel odd at all. I'd love to say that I'd be back, but the things that could hold me back are the price tag, and the lack of proximity to the strip. That being said, if you are getting some cost assistance (biznass trip), and are staying somewhere close (say...the Alexis Park Hotel), then I'd go for sure."

Since then, I'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or Nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. Either way, it was still a great meal overall. \n\nHubs and I made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in Vegas. We put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. Our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. Maybe he was having a rough night. Regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...\n\nJalape\u00f1o hamachi: 5/5: Bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. Exactly what I remember about Nobu! \n\nEhu: 4/5: Per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail red snapper. I've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. Taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty. \n\nRock Shrimp: 3/5: Last time I was at Nobu, hubs and I ordered two servings of this. Not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. This go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy. \n\nBlack Cod: 3/5: Another dish that I used to love. This visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: 4/5: Standard spicy tuna. Fresh, delicious and on the mark. \n\nThis visit was a good one but not a great one overall. I'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping I came on an off-ish night!"

You're there for an experience you'll remember for some time, and that's pretty priceless. \n\nWon't go through all the numerous dishes we tried, but each somehow seemed better than the last and the sushi and sashimi just evaporated on your tongue. The waiter chatted to us about budget and what we like and then we left it to him to just keep the food coming. He was similarly helpful on the drinks front, helping me pick some Japanese whiskeys that perfectly complimented the food. \n\nOne thing that raised our eyebrows was the inclusion of the Australian Beef dish...only because when we got the itimised receipt it was by far the most expensive thing on there... and as a table of seven traveling Aussies it was odd paying that much for something so common to us back home. Note to myself to remember next time to ask at the start for them just to stick to the fish dishes as they are far superior to the beef in my opinion, and much better bang for your buck.\n\nOther than that, it was a fantastic evening. Strange walking out of there into the neon slot machines of the casino, but that's Vegas."

            "review": "This is a difficult review for me to write - I have regarded Nobu Matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in Japanese cuisine. Maybe time is passing by and his 'new style' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore? \n\nI've had sushi at the London, Dallas, and NYC locations of Nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original Matsuhisa restaurant in LA. My visit to Nobu in Las Vegas did not seem to compare with the others. It was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. The service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. Perhaps the global expansion of Nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a Nobu menu in years. Sad.\n\nAnyway, enough hatin'. I had a great creamy spicy crab (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of Nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. It was all good. But I'm not sure I'll seek out the LV branch of Nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in Vegas). \n\nGiven Nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (Morimoto, Tyson Cole's Uchi), I can only give Nobu-LV 3 stars."

Although Nobu is famous for their sushi I actually forwent having any and instead went for their superior and more unique hot and cold dishes. One constant stand out that I have had before is their blackened cod in butter lettuce cups. The varying textures and tastes are a perfect pairing. If you go you must ask for this as it is not on their menu. I also had the tempura fried rock shrimp in the creamy spicy sauce and again it was perfect, yummy, wow. \n\nFor dessert we had the mochi ice cream. And as you can read in my review of Bubbies in Honolulu it probably would've been just as good or better to have gone to Whole Foods afterwards and picked some up. Still is was very good but not Bubbies.\n\nMy only criticism is that this high style establishment is located in the Hard Rock. Kinda feels a little out of place but either way anytime I'm back in Vegas I will undoubtably be back."

Nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.\n\nnow for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. And when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. \n\n*the YK50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light\n*shishito peppers - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame\n*tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips.\n*kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster.\n*yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p\n*sashimi salad. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix\n*amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh.\n*crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll.\n*tempura plate. the vegetables were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce)\n*fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance. \n\ni do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight."

The sushi was fresh and all, but not very innovative or interesting at all.  It was just simple, no-frills negiri sushi.

What I can say is that we let Ed, our server create a tasting menu for us. He did a fabulous job. We told him only to avoid anything with mayo. We had 3 cold sashimi courses,  some yummy cod dish and then the best steak ever! I didn't enjoy the carpacio,  but I have texture issues.  As such we got the finale steak well done and it was so juicy and moist that we couldn't believe it. We were too full to continue to the sushi course.

Every bite filled the table with conversation and a constant hum of \"yum\" and \"oh my\".  \n\nEnjoy Yelpers!"

Judging from the attitude of servers, they just wanted their shift to be over. Second, we opted to sit at the sushi bar. I had to stare at the sushi chef for eternity just to get his attention. I like to order sushi one at a time for maximum enjoyment. Clearly, the chef was annoyed by all the extra work. Third, placemats were placed so closely together, there was no room for me to move without the risk of disturbing the diner next to me. Fourth, I know it's Vegas, but they don't have to put that many tables and chairs in a limited space...utterly cramped everywhere you look. For the price, they should have considered the comfort of diners a little bit."

Smooth doesn't even begin to describe it.  Little did I know that I would forget all about that when I tasted the cod.  Everyone here raves about it - for good reason.  It is simply one of the most delicious dishes I have ever had.  My sister and took turns trying to con each other out of it...only a fish this delicious could spark chopstick violence between two loving siblings.\n\nThe creamy spicy crab was actually both creamy and spicy...and well spicy at that.

This time, I was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:\n\n1. New style sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  S.B. and I both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  One suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish...\n2. Confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  I asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  We settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet.\n3. The format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete with teriyaki chicken, salad, and tempura!\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  I guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a Japanese restaurant.  It was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.\n\nBack to the drawing board Nobu!"

But Nobu manages to find some high quality and good tasting fish. So far this is the only Japanese restaurant in a Casino that I have actually liked.  \n\nThe Bluefin toro Tartar was really fatty which I love and it was sitting in a wasabi sauce that was amazing. With the caviar on top it is one of the single best bites of food I have had. \n\nIf you go I would stick to the specialty items on the menu and not order the sushi. You can get near equal quality sushi for less money at other places and it will fill you up faster so you wont get to enjoy their menu as much. Also, the black cod with miso was sooooooo good. The fish melted in my mouth and didnt fall apart when I put a fork to it. \n\nThe Saki selection is small but the ones we tried were great.\n\nThe lack of 5 stars is due to the fact that we ordered Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was soaked in sauce and there was no resemblance of fish in the dish. Everything else we had we loved though."

For $100 you get their most popular dishes for two, including the hamachi with jalapenos, rock shrimp, miso black cod, plus dessert.  \n\nOK, I get that we're Groupon customers, I understand sometimes we get treated like second class citizens, so my expectations were adjusted, but they managed to not even meet my Groupon expectations.  First of all the portions were way too small.  There were only five thin slices of Hamachi to share between two people.  The rock shrimp came out in a nice size bowl, while that's good enough for one person, this is meant for two!  There was also one piece of black cod too to share between two people.  I would say if you do this deal you guys better be very comfortable eating out of the same plate or bowl haha.  \n\nI also must say I'm not generally a big fan of fusion cuisine.  Nobu did not change my mind.  These are their most popular dishes, but they feel dated and uninspiring.  Perhaps because they've been around for a while and many other places now carry the same things?  The rock shrimp was slathered in this orange color mayo sauce, which reminded me of the walnut shrimp dish so often served in Chinese restaurants these days.  The cod had a very sweet miso sauce that kind of ruined the natural flavor of the fish itself.  \n\nNot good value and not a place I would go into looking for high quality and inventive food."

Think of it as a clever Japanese inspired restaurant that takes familiar flavors and brings them to the next level.\n\nFor example, the yellowtail came as very thin, delicate slices with jalapenos and cilantro, instead of wasabi.  The Black Cod with Miso is sublime.  When I asked for a second order, the waitress suggested the cod with pate in lettuce cups.  That was sublime."

It's a safe way to try a nice selection of things.\n2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. In general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. I have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when I go, I make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and I've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service.\n3, the black cod with miso, and hamachi with jalapeno and ponzu are  musts on the menu. I also recommend the squid pasta, rock shrimp tempura, sashimi salad, and spicy tuna rolls.  The spicy tuna roll there is the best version I've ever had.  The black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish I've ever consumed.\n4, enjoy the celebrity spotting.

I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish.\nTuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing.\nBlue fin toro with caviar. I think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. Mincing it up seems wrong.\n\nAnd the highlight was the lobster spiced dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. Holy Gawd!! This was fantastic!! It was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. They split the lobster lengthwise in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. It makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.\n\nInterestingly, I've been to other Nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. I don't know why, but that seems odd."

This location not as swanky as the one in Caesars Palace  nevertheless is a signature restaurant for the Hard Rock Hotel and a little more casual than 35 Steaks next door.\nThe elegant dining room with Bamboo thrown in the ceiling and minimal d\u00e9cor in a Zen sort of way it's warm and inviting. \nTo start the yellowtail sashimi was superb, delicate sensuous .The crispy tempura rock shrimp drenched in a yuzu spicy sauce over salad greens was tangibly addicting. The picture of the Black Cod in miso should be posted as the Wikipedia definition of umami simple, savory and sweet accented by a pickled ginger shoot. The sushi was ordinary but respectable fresh. A nice little green tea ice cream for dessert to complete the Nobu experience. The staff were friendly professional rock stars.\nIf you want to feel like a baller the groupon deal is the way to go and you be treated to a nice multi-course adventure by one of Japan's best chef. \nKampai."

If you want to feel satisfied you will still drop a lot of $$$.  Perhaps stop by the convenience store on your way over and fill up on a candy bar before eating here to avoid the full financial exposure.  \n\nMy friend and I ate here before seeing Guns N Roses play at The Joint on a Friday night.  Most weekend nights will see Nobu booked up at least until 9PM.  It is open seating in the bar area but this area is tiny.  Nobu strictly enforces their dress policy so no swimming trunks.  It is dinner only so if you are hankering for Nobu at lunch sorry Charlie.\n\nMy favorite things were their pop rock shrimp, sea bass and fresh salmon sashimi.  Their hand rolls are pretty awesome too.  We split a bottle of cold sake that was excellent though a bit overpriced.  Our waiter was a complete snob but I will let that slide.  I highly recommend Nobu for a tasty sushi dining experience."

Placed in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, this place mixes the traditional Japanese seafood restaurant with some urban flair.  This place was pretty darn expensive, but I guess when it comes to fine dining, anything goes.  Thankfully with my appetite, one entree was good enough with white rice. I had the sauteed eggplant, while my friends had other dishes with some sake on the side. Had an asahi beer too.\n\nThe ambiance was never quiet, but it fit the bill.  The tab came out to over $100, but I guess it works for them.  The service was spot on, and the server automatically poured our beers without asking into a cup.  Thought that was pretty regal.  Other than that, I wouldn't say it sucked.  But yet, it didn't give my seal of approval either.  Granted that it was expensive, I could've used the money for other things, like gambling."

Each course was prepared after the next so everything was extremely fresh.  While the plates didn't seem overly complicated when described by our waiter, their relative simplicity worked favorably in creating unique flavors for each item; no flavors were duplicated or even similar to the other dishes served.

I know you are supposed to be high end, but don't tease that way. And uni should only be eaten raw and fresh, as it was a waste to deep fry this sucker, and practically turn it to goo.\n\nI felt like I was at a bar & grill then I was in a high end restaurant the day I was here, as it felt like an \"industry night\".

The service was good to great, but you would expect that from a restaurant of this price, but what's the deal with all the caucasian waiters who can't even pronounce omakase?! (For the record, it's oh-ma-ka-say, not oma-case)\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty lacking. It was dark, loud, and looked almost like someone sort of gave up on the decoration. It was just so-so nice and didn't really give off any particular vibe. And I've never been to any kind of restaurant other than a hole-in-the-wall where they give you the bill on a freaking round white plate. Then after you give them a credit card, they bring back the receipt and a pen. Yes, just the receipt and a pen. No plate, no folio, nothing. They just put the receipt on the tabel with the pen. Does that scream 4-star restaurant to you?\n\nWhen trying out new sushi restaurants, we always like to order some of the basics, to get a foundation to compare against other places. We ordered the sushi and sashimi plates. Both had decent to very good fish (but not *great*) except for two big disappointments: the tuna was really mediocre, and hello! take it easy on the wasabi, chef! Sushi chefs that use too much wasabi are either trying to cover up not-so-fresh fish, or they're just not really good at making sushi. The fish seemed pretty fresh, so I don't think they were trying to cover anything up, which leaves......\n\nMaybe we should've had lower expectations when we came in, or maybe Nobu is only good with the fancier dishes. But for the prices they charge for \"regular\" sushi and sashimi, it's just not worth it.\n\nThe service gets a 4. The decor/vibe gets a 2.5, and \nif the prices were maybe 30-40% lower, I could easily have given them 3 or maybe even 4 stars. But for what you get, I'd give them a 2.5. But since yelp doesn't let you give half stars, I'd round off this overpriced place to a 2."

Because really, you don't dine or even eat at Nobu . . .you experience it with all of your senses. Yes, it is expensive, but what do you expect? You're in Vegas, a city that thrives on the temptation and transiency of money. \n\nIt is glaringly obvious that the chefs at Nobu approach sushi and food like art. From the flawless presentation of each plate to the masterful blending of the phenomenal flavors, dining here is like watching art unveil itself. I tasted unique creations at Nobu that I have never tasted before anywhere else, nor will I probably ever come across again except at this restaurant. Every time a new plate arrived at our table, I felt like applauding (and in many instances, we did). I can not even begin to describe the parade of culinary wonders that we experienced. There was hamachi sashimi with jalapeno, kobe beef carpaccio, marinated cod lettuce wraps, and a wide variety of sashimi and rolls that blew your mind (to name a few). Each was an explosive fusion of the Far East and the rest of the world that stimulated your taste buds. They also have an impressive selection of flavored sake that only serves to emphasize the aromatics of the food.\n\nNot only is Nobu candy for your soul, it is candy for the eyes as well. Don't be surprised if you dine next to an unshaven Justin Timberlake, bitchy Paris Hilton, drunk Vince Vaughn or bald Britney Spears. Just remember to play it cool, you are at Nobu after all."

I drink about 1-3 of these a day and when I go out I will order each bartender's (worth his salt) version of the drink with an open mind before deciding to keep drinking it or tell him to make the one I love. Brian, a young but honest kid, made me the cocktail with the exception of NO cherry (blasphemy in my opinion). I was reluctant of the drink at first watching him make it but it was subtle and smooth, very pleasant, but it was missing something. Being that it was a Japanese restaurant and bar, he used the Nikka Coffee whisky (again more reservations as I prefer Knob Creek Single Barrel), and so on the second drink, after being pleasantly surprised, I boldly asked him to make his full interpretation of the Old Fashioned with cherry.  Great and memorable is how I would describe it. I HATE cherries. HATE. No cherry flavor. Instead, the way he does it creates body and more subtle flavor, enhancing the drink. It ain't some fancy girly drink. Just a good whisky cocktail with nice flavor. He does a few EXTRAS things to the cocktail but you will have to go there and ask for it yourself to see it for yourself. Kid worked hard and was attentive for a timeless drink. What more can you ask for."

They sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  Lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of Japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  We split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant Nigori Sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. The small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing. \n\nThe first course came out quick and cold. A chilled patty of Toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped with caviar, served with a baby silver spoon.  It was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  The caviar was not memorable.  An A+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. Next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  Pretty good.  Next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  My buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the shrimp head and the dressing.  I will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head. \n\nThen started the hot plates.  First was the ever famous Black Miso Cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  A small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  Flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  My friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  Next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. Beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as I would like.  My buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  The dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  Try not to get the grease on you. \n\nNext was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam miso soup. We got a piece of red snapper (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and sea eel which was the most tender fall apart sea eel I have ever tasted.  The sushi rice and soup fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea ice cream.   This just put the nail in the coffin.  We were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.  \n\nThe restaurant closed at 11pm on a Friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  Next time I'm in vegas I plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  This was the $100 omasake.  The $150 would have added some kobe beef and lobster here and there.  We were very happy with our choice.  I think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price."

Also toro sashimi and we got a few more delightful dishes. I would go again! Now I must visit the la location!! This place made my Vegas trip!"

If I'm with a small group I like to sit at the bar and ask the Sushi chef what he recommends. Never have had bad food here, it never disappoints. The staff is nice & friendly. Bonus is, it's at the Hard Rock Hotel, so when I stay here I don't have to go far."

Very simple in design and I wasn't quite convinced that the food (even with the amazing service) was worth the price. Still Nobu is a must try!

The food here resembles Nobu's dishes but it lacks the attention I'm used to seeing.  I think what's to blame is the large amount of business this location gets which takes away from the quality of the dishes.  It's disappointing b/c I think the Hard Rock Hotel itself is one of the better casino venues in LV (music, ppl, energy, etc.) and I like going there to hang out.  If you go, order the yellowtail carpaccio as that's always a pleaser as well as the miso black cod.  Enough sake and beer and you might not care about the rest of what I said.  haha.  Vegas!"

Black cod miso, toro tatare, yellowfin with jalape\u00f1o, and sashimi were the highlights. Excellent drink and sake menu. Service was top notch. Only odd thing was the chopsticks were cheap disposable crap you get at Panda Express. For the $$, they could offer better chopsticks. Overall, 5 star experience.

Finding this to be extremely awkward we opted to sit at a nearly empty bar instead. The two bartenders that were working were vastly different. One (younger guy, I think his name was Rob) was upbeat and very nice. The other guy made us feel beyond unwelcomed and like we were more of a bother to him then anything. \nWe chose the chef platter. This came with 10 pieces of fish,  5 different types. It also came with a Himalayan salt block which was amazing! Everything was so fresh and amazing quality.

Im not sure if it was dry miso or not. But it was a different sauce that mixed so well with the japanese snapper! The crunchy addition was a perfect touch! The yellow tail, salmon, scallop, and tuna sushis were all in one plate including the sauce. The sauce was the perfect sauce for the sushi! The rock shrimp tempura was amazing! No extra sauce needed! My partner absolutely loved this dish! The black cod miso --where do I start? It was cooked so perfectly. Not overcooked, not undercooked. When I say perfectly cooked this is what cooking is supposed to be like. It seemed like it it was taken out of the pan at the exact perfect second! The bento box dessert loved the matcha gelato sooooo good! The chocolate was great, love dark chocolate! If you're more for the sweet chocolate you can also mix the matcha gelato with the dark chocolate which is what my partner. Expect to pay about 200-250 including tip though for all these, but it is sooo worth it! Ahhhh it was so good, I'm thinking of going back before we leave vegas!"

After scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on Nobu. Sometimes I have to be in the mood for sushi, I don't always crave it like other people I know, so I was worrying about committing to a reservation. I was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (True story, I made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the Flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for Manischewitz.)\n\nOK - Back to the matter at hand: Nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all Japanese food all the time. Not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, BUT THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I DIE. We had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on. \n\nWe dined on:\n\n-edamame\n-miso soup\n-tempura fried rock shrimp with some type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce\n-yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (OUT OF THIS WORLD)\n-red snapper with dry miso (also, amazing)\n-salmon new style sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious\n-soft shell crab roll\n-spicy tuna roll (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)\n\nThe dessert was good but unremarkable. I'm more about the main event.\n\nCap that with some amazing gin cocktail that I now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals I have had in my little life thus far... \n\nIn short, take your gambling winnings to Nobu and order everything the server suggests."

I felt like I was being served by a brooding, bitter member of a failing rock band that had taken this job because he had to pay the bills. I would had some sympathy if the restaurant was busy, but half the tables were empty because our reservations were towards the end of the night. Maybe he was pissed because of that, but for $400, I'm inclined to not give a shit about that and want some proper service.\n\nHaving said that, I would have rated Nobu somewhere between 4-5 stars based purely on their food.

It was the most unbelievable experience ever!  We had the A5 or something like that.  They brought out at least 9 courses including dessert.  Our waitress was Adrian and I think when the food is spectacular and service goes above n beyond it just makes the whole experience that much better.  My favorite fish I think was yellowtail.  All of the raw fish there that I was served was very thin and delicate.  Nothing I ate was fishy or slimy.  I even had the uni.  If you're a sushi rookie then Nobu is the place to start.  Keep in mind too, you get what you pay for.  This is not a cheap restaurant.  Be ready to drop some money.  The manager Kenny who was on duty last night even came over to see what I thought of their restaurant.  I live very close to the Malibu location and cannot wait to check it out!!!  This is my new fav restaurant!!  Don't forget to try the Wagyu Beef.... It just melts in your mouth and the texture is like cashmere, weird huh??  Trust me.... You'll have no regrets!!!  To the staff at Nobu LV:  thank you everyone for the excellent service and I'll definitely be coming back every time we are in town.  Ask for Adrian to be your server!!!"

The food selection and quality is amazing, the portions are small and the presentation is out of this world, and as expected the prices are sky high.

Had a good (overpriced) cocktail at the bar, then we were seated at possibly the worst table in the place, despite our months-early reservation. Got a booth back by the server pow-wow area / cash register, next to a massive table of really drunk and really loud patrons. Ok, fine. Ordered many dishes, including small plates, entrees, sushi rolls, etc. My father makes it clear to the waiter he doesn't like mushrooms (this is pertinent later). \n\nOur 3 tacos come out - $34 worth of tacos - and they are the SMALLEST, most laughable portion size ever. I literally laughed out loud when they put them down. They were no bigger than lime wedges (I posted a photo). Very good, but ridiculously priced and sized. Ok, fine.\n\nThe other dishes start to come out, and they're timed terribly. Sushi after entrees, entrees at different times...I ate alone basically while my companions looked on, waiting for their food. My father's entree comes out and it's the WRONG one. Finally, when his actual dinner arrives, it's covered in mushrooms. The waiter never mentioned that could be a problem when my father placed his order, and the menu mentioned nothing about mushrooms. Ok, fine.\n\nMy husband's $80 sashimi chef's special comes out and it's also laughably undersized. Literally 9 pieces of fish for $80. When we go to Morimoto in Philadelphia, a $50 sashimi plate has easily 3x the amount of fish on it. Same quality. I get that it's Vegas but this was a joke. The waiter never explained what fish were on the plate either - just left my husband to guess. This was the last straw.\n\nOverall the food is fine, but there are so many other places that serve comparable stuff at way better prices. Nobu is nothing special. I hope for the sake of other diners my experience is not typical, but it was enough to burn this frequent Vegas traveler. I will not be back."

Not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting. \n\nThings to order:\n- yellowtail jalepeno sashimi\n- butter lettuce cod\n- new style toro sashimi\n- negi toro hand roll \n- Kobe sashimi with hot rocks\n- rock shrimp tempura\n- soft shell crab special \n- artichoke salad (without noodles)\n- YK35 sake\n- peach Bellini\n- Japanese whiskey flight \n- coconut-lime sake\n- bento box\n\nLast time we were in we had Andrew as our server. Super great guy. He gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. I'm going to request to sit in Andrew's section every time I go back. \n\nOf course I wish Nobu wasn't so expensive but I still think it's well worth every penny."

BUT, don't let me set your expectations too high.\n3. Overall experience is  warm, satisfying and sorta exciting - hey, it's Nobu.\n\nWhy you should not go to Nobu LV:\n1. If you're going to Nobu, you're either a foodie, looking for a trendy spot or from Japan and need your rice (like the table next to us). Well, while the food is pretty darn good, I heard the other spots - Honolulu, NYC etc have a hipper vibe.\n2. You want to save money to eat during the rest of your trip. We gorged out and ended up spending at least $150 each. \n3. You want to stick on the strip. While the Hard Rock isn't very far, it'd be cool if Nobu was in the midst of the chaos. On the other hand, maybe it's off-strip locale protects it...not sure on that one.\n\nIn any case, try it. You won't regret it. At least you can say you been to Nobu - like I basically am in this review."

For those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best Japanese in Las Vegas. When I read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so I'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at Nobu 101:\n\nFirst My DONT'S:\n*Do NOT come here with a low budget in mind . You will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. I've come in here and tried to do it \"cheap\" and walked away angry and disappointed. Wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly. \n*Do not order off the main menu . It's boring. The food isn't that great. Steak is blah. Tempura is blah. Seriously avoid avoid avoid.\n*Don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!! \n*Don't blindly get the chef's omakase. You'll likely end up disappointed.\n*Don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. Order EXOTIC cool things you can't get at home.\n\nNow for what to do!:\n*Peruse the \"special\" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. Literally all my great meals here have been 100% OFF the main menu. The off the menu items are by far the best\n*Be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. It will really blow you away. I've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. Tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations ! \n\nLastly, I'll leave you with my favorites. Most are off the menu. Most are seasonal. Yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly I've never been disappointed when ordering this way ! \n\nCold:\n*Barracuda. OMG. Best sashimi I've had in my life. Who knew!\n*Tazmanian Ocean Trout. My next favorite. Basically like a mild buttery salmon. \n*Japanese snapper with pineapples\n*Kampachi. I do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalape\u00f1o way instead of the yellow tail. Once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again ! \n\nHot:\n*Black miso cod lettuce wraps... WITH FOIE GRAS. Insanely good.\n*The huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. Definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. Get 1 of these if you have a huge group. It's big and heavy\n*Quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)\n\nCliffsnotes: Avoid ordering from the main menu. It's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. Be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. Enjoy!"

At 50 bucks a serving it wasn't cheap but it was so worth it for the amount of ossetra and toro in the dish. \n\nI also had two uni shooters, omg so good.\n\nMonkfish pate with caviar--YUM!!! Would probably skip next time for more uni.\n\nNobu crispy rice with tuna ( at this point in the meal I secretly unbuttoned my pants, stealth mode). \n\nAnd of course the rock shrimp with jalepeno sauce.\n\nNext we ( I was eating with one other person so you can't blame me for being a glutton), had the japanese wagyu tataki, which I have been craving since a recent trip to Japan. Melt-in-your-mouth good.\n\nWe both had the chef's daily omakase, which was outstanding, and finished with a light deconstructed cheesecake thing that I couldn't eat.\n\n&& THEN  I didn't eat for a day.\n\nSO GOOD, expensive, yes but you get what you pay for! No regrets. \n\nI knocked off one star because service was terrible and I felt like I was at a strip club lol ( seated in the bar)."

While I do think Nobu is a great sushi place to experience, it's a bit over hyped and is priced accordingly..\n\nThe place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  Our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  I ordered the Omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes:\n1) Toro tartare with caviar - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous!\n2) 4 different sashimi dishes - Japanese red snapper, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. I left Nobu with a very strong Ponzu aftertaste\n3) Black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  The sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.  \n4) Tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - I really regret asking to have this well done.  Doh!\n5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.\n\nThe waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  I found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  Nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  You see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  The predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local Cabarets.\n\nBottom line:  I'm glad I tried Nobu.  But, it'll be a long while before I come back especially when there are so many other options there in Vegas."

I also love the tiny tacos (no idea what is in them but they are scrumptious). Everything else was great from the kabobs to sushi rolls.\n\nAnother thing I enjoy about this place is the list of beverages. We only had cocktails but they have several sake cocktails that are oh so tasty.\n\nThe menu can be overwhelming so I suggest you ask your server what he/she recommends so you get to taste the best of the best Nobu has to offer.\n\nAtmosphere is very Vegas, dark and loud.

Truthfully, the service hasn't always been rude, but I have had two experiences that were less that desirable during the last five times I went.\n\nLet's knock out the negatives really quickly.  Once, they lost my reservation.  No big deal, but they acted like they were doing me a favor by providing a table 45 minutes later.  Whatever.  \n\nThe other thing was pretty funny actually.  Some people would be bothered by this, but I laughed.  Once, I took a client who had a bit too much to drink, I guess.  When we were seated, he was looking at the chopsticks that were balancing against a rock and asked the waitress if the rock was intended as a tool to get her attention.  She didn't laugh.  Instead, she chose to tell our entire table, \"Not unless you want me to spit in your food.\"  Not too professional for such a highly regarded restaurant, but then again he was being a dumbass.\n\nOn to the food.  Yes, it is amazing.  No, I cannot tell you why.  Everything I have ever tasted here was exceptional.  The price is the only negative.  The toro nigiri is to die for even at $20 a piece, or whatever it was.  I once ordered three Kobe beef appetizers for a group.  I guess I should have asked the price first because they were $180 each!  Good news is that they were delicious and expensed.  I also recall having some tasty sea bass here.  Nothing has ever disapponted.\n\nThe location is inside of the Hard Rock Hotel.  It isn't very large, so be sure to have a reservation in advance.  Sitting at the sushi bar is also a fun experience, which I definitely recommend at least once."

When you factor in the cost (2 of us spent over $400), it comes nowhere near what its name would imply.\n\n\nDECOR\nThe decor is trying too hard, pulling in all directions. There are individually cool elements, like the river rock wall, or the exploded hashi ceiling. But there are at least 5 different themes like this all smashed together. Complete contrast to japanese design principles of linear minimalism. Must be the Vegas factor.\n\n\nFOOD\nStarted out pretty good, with a Toro-Caviar dish. Great mix of flavors and a unique sauce. Everything after that, including the sushi, was was just good. A beef tenderloin dish came out steaming hot, but with little flavor and essentially raw asparagus and enoki still clumped together on top, like it just got unwrapped from the plastic pkg. I've eaten better in strip mall Japanese (many of these are surprisingly good!). I'm not a Japanese food expert/snob, but I've lived in Japan, worked in Japanese restaurants and cook a lot of Japanese dishes at home. Then again, so do millions of Japanese people, and they're not all snobs or experts. But I know how to compare Japanese-inspired food experiences. I also realize there is a fusion element going on at Nobu, but that is done much better at places like Sea Saw in Scottsdale. Overall = disappointing.\n\n\nOTHER FACTORS I'M NOT COUNTING IN MY EVALUATION\n(but worth noting for lols)\n\nTHOR\nOur waiter was absolutely unintelligible. We nicknamed him Thor. He looked like a Norwegian model from a 1976 Playgirl. Very nice guy, but we just pretended to understand what he said. Every time he walked away, we both said: \"You catch any of that??? Me neither!\" No complaints on the service, just glad the menu was available to point at.\n\nBLIND DATE VEGAS\nThe table next to us was fookin hilarious. It was the most awkward blind date I've ever witnessed, not on TV. We kept looking around for cameras, because we swore this was a setup for a show. It is a crime that this was not captured on video. This middle-aged blowhard had this girl,  who had to be 20 years younger (NTTAWWT), held captive while he ranted about his boat and his travels and his companies (plural!) that he coudln't talk about because of his work with the NSA. He'd have to kill the whole restaurant if he told us. And he WAS talking to the whole restaurant. He insisted on feeding her from his chopsticks, for every bite. He kept asking for her review of the date, during the date. EPIC DEFEAT. He let us all know that he had to ask the universe for the right person to meet. The girl seemed to politely disagree with the universe. Bless her heart. She was a trooper.\n\nAlso, his chopstick skills were so good because he was \"raised in Japan\", but when she wanted him to speak Japanese, somehow that got by his experience of being raised there.\n\n\nso...\n\nNobu, meh.\n\nThor, enjoy Valhalla.\n\nBlind Date, see ya on the uncensored DVD."

During the night, the server was not engaging at all and rarely stopped to see how we were doing. To top it all off, since we were a party of 8, our tip was already added on to the bill.

We walked in on a Saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. We went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were Nobu's house specialties, including \"new-style sashimi.\" These consist of the best fish, sashimi style, with delicate sauces and garnishes: yellowtail with jalapeno, live octopus with a Peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon with ponzu sauce, tuna with miso-mustard sauce. Everything was first-class, including the Junmai Daiginjo sake.\n\nThen, I ordered the bento box chocolate cake dessert. We were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. No problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. Another ten minutes went by. Our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. He tried to give us a plateful of mochi ice cream to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful of mochi ice cream and then a chocolate cake. Another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. It was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. We ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? By this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already. \n\nWhen our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. When I mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. But I was miffed that I even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.\n\nToo bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. Even for a Saturday night in Vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant."

None of the dishes disappointed me and I couldn't wait for each dish to come out as they got better and better as the meal went on. \n\nSupposedly the owner of the company that took us here is a big deal so we got excellent service. The waiters and the chef knew who he was so we got taken care of. I went to show someone where our table was (literally not even a minute) and my napkin was refolded at my seat. \n\nThis is what we had:\n\n-Edamame\n-Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno\n-Rock Shrimp Tempura with Cream Spicy Sauce\n-Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu\n-Black Cod Miso\n-Chilean Sea Bass with Dried Miso\n-Beef tenderloin (medium rare) in a claypot\n-Mushroom soup\n-Pickled Sushi Platter  \n-Sushi platter\n-Ceviche with mixed seafood (and quail egg)\n-Fish egg sushi with quail egg\n-Sweet potato and avocado tempura\n-Dessert: Chef's Tasting Platter\n\nAlcohol: I had a mango martini--delicious! I don't really like to taste alcohol, but this was a good sweet/tart drink that got me slightly buzzed. Good tasting + getting buzzed = winner!\n\nSome highlights of the meal: \n-The seafood was amazingly fresh and it was the best quality I've had. My top favorite was the black cod miso and the chilean sea bass. Melt in your mouth HEAVEN. \n-Beef tenderloin was perfection--I love my meats medium rare and it was good and bloody. \n-I did a shot of the ceviche with a raw quail egg and it was great. You only live once, and if you want to try something might as well do it at Nobu since they know how to prepare it properly. Bottoms up!\n\nI'm so glad I went with a company because there is no way I would have been able to 1. afford all of this food and 2. to order this many plates. Nobu is great and I would gladly go back if I had the chance!"

We arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  Upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    The atmosphere at Nobu is much different than Morimoto...Nobu is more lively and trendy.  \n\nThey have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  We started with the oysters and the lobster ceviche which is served in lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting. \n\nFor our second course we chose the creamy spicy crab and the rock shrimp tempura in butter ponzu.  The creamy spicy crab may be one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  At the end of our weekend I asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about Vegas and he responded without hesitation \"Eating creamy spicy crab at Nobu.\"  Not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the creamy spicy crab.  \n\nWe chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) and yellowtail scallion.  Each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.\n\nFor dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  Our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   All were amazing.\n\nThe service was outstanding throughout the night.  The meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at Morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  In the end I felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  Including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  I do have to add that it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  When I made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  I'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in Vegas, and especially at a place like Nobu, but I do not like it when I go through the effort and others don't have to."

In each case we had great staff that helped us pick dishes or simply brought what they recommended and the results were off the charts good. These guys have a huge menu and a ton of stuff to offer that isn't printed on the menu, I really think the best way to do Nobu is turning it over to your server to make recommendations. My crew is pretty adventurous eaters although there are limits, that lets us try just about anything. If you are more conservative about seafood and sushi I think it will be hard to get much out of Nobu.\n\nAnd yes, it is crazy expensive. Crazy. There are lots more affordable meals in Vegas and probably at the Hard Rock itself. There are lots of better price performers in Vegas. \n\nNobu is great and it is expensive.

The server started out to be a great guy pitching us the idea of him creating our menu for the table and then we caught the side note that he was planning to create a menu based off a budget of $250/person. We specifically asked for that to be our TOTAL with everything included (food, apps, drinks, everything.) we are having a great time at dinner with his suggestions thinking we are in our budget until we get our bill. The waiter drops it off, we look at it, it's $100 more than what we told him we were willing to spend, and then when he comes back we ask him why there was a miscommunication when we were very clear with what we were willing to spend. He had been ordering dishes for us even after the conversation about our total bill expectation. It would've been good customer service on their part to let us know the details (mostly prices) as we were ordering throughout the night. He quickly avoided the conversation and said he would return with his manager. He returned with a new bill and no manager. We told the waiter we thought he was a good serve in terms of ordering us things we very much enjoyed, but that he came off as sneaky to us by not letting us know prices & ordering expensive dishes for our table. The manager eventually approached the table & couldn't have been more rude & condescending to all of us. I work in customer service, and have also  been a manager of a restaurant in a tourist city. You cannot tell a customer (who is a tourist) that's how your restaurant works once the bill is presented when it was never explained to the customer in the first place. We will never go back to this nobu, especially because of the way the situation was handled, especially by the rude manager."

            "review": "I was skeptical, but Nobu delivered. I just finished dinner with a friend of mine and I had to write a review before I forgot the details. Let's just get to the chase.\n\nMy friend and I walked in and I asked our server what the best three dishes were. He then recommend these three. I felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. But I often do this for restaurants that I've never been to. After dinner, I find myself recommending the same. Here's the pro and cons:\n\n1) Toro Carpaccio- Okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, I had to know what it was about. Now I know and here's the scoop. The toro is incredibly delicious. It is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro I've ever had. The fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. Capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil and soy dressing over greens really hit the mark. I will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (That's right, I'm Chinese and I'm saying it). I would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.\n\n2)Yellowtail Jalapeno- This was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. The Yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. The jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. I would actually recommend this as a first dish. \n\n3) Black Cod Miso- I thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. Cooked to near perfection, the Cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. The miso glaze wasn't much to look at. For me, it resembled gravy. I've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. Nevertheless, the dish was great. I actually prefer Black Cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. Sweet Miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable. \n\n4)Sea Urchin sashimi or sushi!!! Just order it. \n\nMy friend and I were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but I must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. Overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. Here's the list:\n\n-Salmon skin hand roll- thin slices of salmon skin with gobo, rice and seasoning. Nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the salmon skin.\n\n-Baracuda Dry Miso- $40 for six slices of barracuda. Very interesting texture as I haven't had barracuda before. The lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. Again, I see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so I simply eat and keep my comments to myself. \n\nLive Scallop- again, great cut of scallops, but nothing special to write home about. It was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce. \n\nNew Style Oyster- Four pieces of Kumamoto Oysters served ready to enjoy. So you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.\n\nCrispy rice w/ Big Eye Tuna- For lack of a better term, it's Japanese tatter tots. Square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. Well prepared, tasty, but nothing special. \n\nAll in all, it was a great experience. My general assessment is that Nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. Not exactly my cup of tea. Maybe I'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. However, I can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. So I eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. Hope this helps."

Don't think that just because a roll has a big rice that is fit for sharing.  I am sure a lot of thought, planning, and preparation that goes into each roll.  If you don't mind paying a lot of money for very good, but small, sushi pieces, then you will be happy.  On the other hand, if you are used to getting a lot of food for your money, you will be disappointed or broke.  \n\nYou may also want to go to Nobu for its high energy vibe and great atmosphere.  It is inside the Hard Rock Casino that is a younger and livelier crowd than some casinos.  The service is better than average and the decor is very nice.  There are also other entrees other than sushi.\n\nYou will save several dollars and get what you pay for if you stick to hand rolls, sashimi or regular sushi (2 pieces).  This will offer you the opportunity to appreciate the high-end atmosphere without high-end prices."

I am not a fan of seafood unless it's shrimp. \n\nWe walked up to the hostess stand and this polite young lady with long hair asked us  if we would like a table or to sit at the sushi bar. That is when I asked if this was just seafood. She said no there is beef and chicken. I was relieved. The decor is very Japanese. Bamboo on the wall, the ceiling had the wood and rice paper feel. Which gave a dim light, made it hard on my eyes to read the menu.\n\n Thank god for Adrienne our server, because I know nothing about sushi and the menu had me lost. She was really nice and helped point out some good food! The chicken skewers with teriyaki were ok. The beef skewers with teriyaki were delicious, the meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. Each order is $13. I ordered a side of white rice $3. The shrimp rolls were amazing crunchy warm goodness and I'm not a sushi person but this is really good. My boyfriend ordered the spicy shrimp and I got to try that it was good, had some veggies in it. \n\nThe servings here are tapas bar size. It's good food but expensive as heck."

My only issue the level of foodieness that is the norm here; I don't eat any grains, soy, or dairy (yeah I know don't eat sushi right?!?) and at some sushi places they will make rolls with cucumber instead of rice.  Not here - they were very helpful in terms of switching sauces and advising against dishes that could not be 'tampered' with but overall it was a bit of a chore to choose wisely.  That being said the quality of ingredients was awesome; that is why i eat sushi...i like fresh fish.  We had some hot dishes too...totally forgot what but loved every bite.  \n\nSO I vote YES to this place unless you eat paleo and want to dine with semi-reckless abandon, in that case go get a burger, hold the bun, ketchup, and fries."

The sushi is definitely fresh and the warm dishes are absolutely delicious! The inside is clean, nice and has modern decor. The sushi bar is quite large and there's also a bar and lounge in the front. The spicy tuna roll is different from any other place that I've tried. It does not have the minced up tuna but instead a nice, thick slice of tuna with a spicy, scallion sauce. Also, the rolls have the rice on the inside not on the outside, like you find at most places now a days. The rolls are small, so they fit right into your mouth with one bite. Some things that I recommend are the yellowtail jalapeno... it is to die for. The yellowtail is fresh and the jalapeno pepper gives it a little kick. The black cod miso is absolutely delicious, it melts in your mouth. The rock shrimp tempura is really good as well. They also have new cocktails every month, so ask your server or the bartender what the special cocktails are. The lychee martini is really good!\n\nNobu is also a great place to spot celebrities. If you dine here you'll most likely see at least one celebrity. It's a hot spot.\n\nTry Nobu and you won't be disappointed but I have to say again, don't be cheap!!! Enjoy the ambiance and the great food."

But as the years have past other restaurants have caught up and copied Nobu's menu.  The food in Vegas is still top notch, with fresh fish, inventive sauces that accentuate the food and great sake.  The price is very expensive for what you get but at the end of the night it is about the whole experience.\n\nMy favorite dishes are: toro tartare, hamachi sashimi with jalapenos, and the fried rock shrimp with cream sauce.\n\nInside scoop: do not get the free for all omakase where the waiter pretends to customize the menu for you.

We are in Vegas, I know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, I expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.\n\nOur waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common Japanese dishes.\n\nWe tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to spicy scallops, freshwater eel, albacore, and yellowtail with jalapenos. Everything was... good. Not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.\n\nThe interior of this location was bland. One of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. The main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.\n\nThe banana cake with sour cream ice cream was a high note, although the spoonful of ice cream that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like I was caught in a scene from American Psycho. \n\nFor all the noise I heard about Nobu being something special, I left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run Japanese restaurants is such a treat."

Presentation and tastes of these two plates are superb and I have never had before. You will be craving for more after you finish the tuna tartar, which are sized like your pinky; you will keep sucking the shrimp tails to get the last piece out.\n\nThe reason of my miss experience is that we trusted the waiter's recommendations and ordered the cooked food. To be honest, I strongly advise everyone to stay away from the cook food. If you want to be full, go across the street and get a burger after. This place is pricey and you definitely like to spend your money wisely on the right stuff.\n\nP.S. I have not had the opportunity to have hamachi jalapeno and cannot offer any comment. However, I know a place in San Francisco offers a very similar dish and it was quite good, if not great."

I adored the oyster shooters (the perfect starter) and the sashimi the most. Tried toro, salmon, and yellowtail with jalape\u00f1o- all tasted so fresh and exotic with the ponzu and spicy flavors. White fish with chili paste was a close second to the sashimi platter, Wagyu beef incredibly tender. \nAlso, did I mention the drinks were phenomenal? The lychee martini was good and strong, the cucumber martini was refreshing, the mango and passion super sweet and fruity (would suggest for a fruity drinker) and last but not least the favorite drink was the Hakka Nigori. The Hakka Nigori was like a Mexican mojito but instead with sake- chilled, minty, strong and delicious! The ambiance made me feel like I was in a Japanese hole-in-the-wall restaurant. \nThe service was fantastic and our server helped us decide what to order on the menu. I would go back again and completely trust my server with the menu and have them decide for me, they're that good! Great service, top 5 favorite restaurants in Vegas and I will be back. Can't wait to try Nobu Caesars location!"

It's great if you don't know what you want, but the guy ripped us off so badly we wanted to cry.

I understand that the servers need to make money, but seriously - don't purposely rip your customers off.  I could hardly enjoy such a delicious meal after paying the bill.\n\nSuch delicious food can be expensive, it's high quality and reputation can warrant high prices, so my complaint isn't in the cost of the food, it is instead of the ethics of this particular situation.

            "review": "Nobu.\n\nWell, what can I say?  I've wanted to go to Nobu for a really, really long time.  Being in Vegas for the weekend, I decided this would be the time to do it. \n\nWe started with an assortment of sashimi.  Tuna, Mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  Then a large platter of raw Chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  A warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  MMMMMMM.\nNext came tempura King Crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  It was amazing.  My husbands eyes rolled back into his head- I thought that he was having a seizure.  Then came the spicy tuna roll and eel and cucumber roll.  Both good.  But the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  And I mean in a bad way.  So I've never had uni.  I know that is super lame.  But I've been waiting until I was at a really good establishment because I wanted to be sure that I was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   My fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     EEEEEEWWWW.\nSo it came pureed and then wrapped and tempura 'd.  Wow.  Well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater I dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  Big mistake!  I take a bite.  The exterior is nice and crisp.  Within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  Maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes.\n-Abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear.\nThank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  Super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw Kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  So we got to cook our own slices of Kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  Can we say FUN?  I've always wanted to do that.\nDessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  I did like the Shiso sorbet though.\n\nThe reason why I have given Nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that I had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is Vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  Even as I am writing this I cannot believe what I am about to say.  I am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  In this instance I was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  But for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  Ouch!  Gees- I have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  Am I just a cheap ol' broad?  Or have I gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  Something just felt really wrong about that.    I just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  But, then again, I guess that pretty much sums up Vegas."

Instead he was wanting our party of six to let him bring us appetizers, and entree that he thought we would prefer. My wife ask for a menu and the waiter was put out. He did return with one menu. Others in my party ask for a menu, where the waiter eventually  brought them. He was obviously disinterested when we ask a few questions in regards to the menu. I then ask to speak with the manager, he in turn was condescending to my wife. That ended our brief experience. I can only speak for the Nobu at the Hard Rock. But definitely do not recommend this place."

I have been to the Nobu in Malibu and yes , can't beat the view but this place is the original Nobu and the sushi tasted a little better. They used different sauces on some things I noticed. The Kronuts were a must try for dessert. What I love most about this place is you will never feel full or bloated, just completely satisfied. The service is top quality and very professional. Tiradito sashimi is an absolute must try and the  Spicy Tuna hand roll is also my favorite."

After my recent visit I realized I have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  Here are some of my favorites:\n\nToro Tartare with Caviar - This dish makes me want to commit a felony.  If I were on death row it would be my last meal, I would definitely die happy.  As one of my favorite sayings on Howard Stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.\n\nYellowtail with Jalapenos - Always fresh and delicious!  I believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor. \n\nSashimi Salad - BAM!  The dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.  \n\nKobe Beef Toban Yaki - I'm not a religious person by any means but I'm certain the heeled hands of Jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.\n\nOf course you cannot go there without consuming a couple of their saketini's.  Why can't any other bar/restaurant get their saketini's to be this delicious??  They are alone worth a visit there."

I decided to sit at the sushi bar since the \"dining room\" was directly next to it. The sushi chefs were great conversation and they had great cuts of sashimi (which is important to me). Nobu LV felt more like a quicky place to get sushi. The motif of modern surfing really didn't strike me as Nobu like (I've been to the one in Miami and liked it better)."

Light & Refreshing!) I don't think they used Nama-wasabi, but I didn't mind. \nI know it's catered to non-Japanese, but they definitely can make a better green tea. \n\nOther pros: Nice Decor & interior Design. No waiting time (although we came here pretty darn early; so, that may be why). I didn't really have that much issue w/ noise (like some other yelpers were saying). Great service (very attentive)!\n\nLong story short, if you're thinking about visiting this place, \nordering some California Roll, Tuna Roll, or your regular Tuna, Salmon, & Yellowtail Sushi are waist of your money. I felt so sad to see some people next to us eating such thing & paying so much for their dinner. You can get those anywhere for a decent price w/any restaurants, unless you're going to places like Rio's Seafood Buffet (Their sushi taste nasty! Although everything else tasted good :p). \n\nAnywa, Great Sushi* \nFish are fresh, Shari (the Rice) is nice and airy.\nWell worth the price. Order the Omakase :d I recommend it."

At one point the couple next to us leaned over to discuss one of our selections! The place is small and somewhat crowded. Although I frequent Japanese and Sushi restaurants this menu contained many things I had never had before. Most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size (~$14-25). We chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections. \nThe yellowtail tartar was great, the lobster ceviche was not so. The tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size). We tried the house special (a rainbow roll) and Eel sushi. Both were good, but not my favorite rolls I'd ever had-actually kind of plain. For dessert the bento box, essentially a souffl"

I forgot I even had a food blog until  of the way into my dinner. That is definitely a compliment!\n\nNobu is famous for a reason. If you are going to eat here, prepare to drop some money. $100 pp minimum, $150 pp is more like it and that's without drinks.  Interestingly, even though you feel like you ate a ton of food, it really isn't that much. If you have a big eater in your group, have him/her eat something first. This is a place to savor each bite, not to eat like pigs at a trough. (That's what the Planet Hollywood buffet is for.)  And when they ask if you want edamame, they are $7 a bowl, not free. \n\nThe restaurant is gorgeous. We had reservations at 7:00 on a Saturday, and even though we arrived at 6:20, we were seated immediately.  Dress was anywhere from casual to dressy, even jeans (which leads me to the old adage - just because you can, doesn't mean you should.)\n\nI had ordered a blueberry mojito ($15) but only took a small sip when I realized it was WAY too strong. The waiter took it off the bill without me having to complain about it. That's ok - the food was so good, I was fine with water.\n\nInstead of ordering off the menu, we went Omakase style - the chef makes the selections. Actually, it seems like your waiter makes the selections but that's close enough. The waiter asked us our likes and dislikes so he could tailor our food to our tastes. We said we didn't eat mussels, clams, oysters and that sort of thing. Other than that, it was going to be a free for all. (In listening to the other servers describe dishes to the other customers, I suspect there is a standard Omakase menu.)\n\nThe menu was chosen to give a different sensation with each dish. We started with the cold dishes, had two hot dishes and then continued with more cold dishes (which don't seem to fill you up for some reason.)\n\nThe first selection was yellowtail sashimi with miso with a shaved bit of jalapeno and a cilantro leaf for each bite. I don't like spicy foods so I was hesitant about the jalepeno. But I'm glad I tried it. YOWZA - the jalapeno was small enough to give you that kick without making you scream for water. And the cilantro cooled down the fire. The yellowtail was so fresh, you wouldn't even know it was fish. I've never ordered sashimi before and I'm hooked. Wow, wow, wow.\n\nThe next choice was whitefish sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips. I wish I could have poured the sauce in a cup and drank it, it was THAT flavorful. \n\nWe had salmon sashimi with caviar and dill, blue fin toro sashimi, Japanese red snapper with dried miso and seared tuna with ponzu. Every dish kept getting better and better and had its own unique flavor and special quality to it. \n\nOur hot dishes consisted of beef tenderloin with a butternut squash base and topped with cooked purple onions. The beef was so tender, it fell apart with the chopsticks.  Our second hot dish was 2 pieces of cod and 2 pieces of scallops baked in phyllo - both in butter lettuce cups.  I preferred the scallops over the cod which surprised me because I've never eaten scallops before and I generally like cod. \n\nMy least favorite dish was the hearts of palm salad. It was a nice change to the other fish items but probably not worth $20. \nThe servers were so attentive - both in bringing the food and the clean up afterward.\n\nMy recommendations to enjoying Nobo (1) realize that you're going to spend a ton of money so quit whining about the price or eat at HomeTown Buffet (2) don't order off the menu - the point is to try something new that you would never otherwise see at your favorite sushi place (ie - don't order friggin' tempura or California rolls at Nobu and then complain that it tastes better at your local strip mall) (3) come here with 4 or less people. People tend to be greedier when they are in big groups so you may pay $150 and eat 4 bites of sashimi which would be a total rip off. (4) you're not there to stuff yourself (see #1), you're there to appreciate the art of food.  So sit back, let someone else do the ordering and savor every bite."

Service was slow but perfect to enjoy a nice dinner and discuss the evening's events with your companion.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely return and try their Beef Wagyu Beef or other signature dishes.

It's an exciting way to try the more creative and special dishes from the chef's knife.  It requires about two hours for dinner but well worth the time.  When you order, you'll be asked about allergies and this is a good time to mention the types of seafood that you don't like.\n\nIf your party is four or less, I recommend siting at the sushi bar.  We luckily sat in good view of the lead sushi chef and watched his amazing knife and prep skills.  He was very focused in his tasks but explained each round of courses personally.  There is a high level of construction/presentation involved with each dish so I was in awe of his techniques.\n\nOne really surprising thing was the appearance of black caviar, white truffle slices, kobe beef, and foie gras during the run of courses.  All those fantastic flavors in one sitting.  My friends and I opted for the $150 per person course.  There is a $200 option too.\n\nHaving lived in the Seattle area most of my life, I've been able to enjoy really good sushi restaurants.  However, I was astounded by how good the dishes are at Nobu.

The Brussels sprouts were absolutely addicting -- very different to the ones I'm used to. There's nothing generic about the Brussels sprouts here.\n\nOur meal for 5 people with sake was $500, with tip.\n\nA really great meal with great service. Our server Dan was superb! BTW, I just realized that it's been 10 years since my last visit. WOW!"

Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to walk through the casino, through the nasty drunken guys who whistle and harrass you, just so you can go to the bathroom, it makes it hard to enjoy your cocktail during dinner when you know if you gotta go, you'd have to make a journey to find the restroom, and once you're there, there's a huge line full of drunk girls waiting to use the restroom as well. I would think for such a high scale restaurant, that there would at least be a bathroom inside. \n\nOther than that.. the food's amazing, the bloodymary was delicious, the sangria was good too! The service is acceptable for the price you are paying for, and it's great because they expanded the place, so there is rarely a wait to be seated. p.s. the dessert is presented really pretty thaty you don't want to ruin it by eating it lol"

            "review": "Yikes, what happened?\n\nConsistency isn't one of Nobu's strengths, apparently, which I believe should be a priority if they are going to charge their customers as much as they do.  I ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which I do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.\n\nThe signature hamachi with jalapeno?  Devoid of all velvety tenderness.  The salmon sashimi?  Like chewing a rug.  The maguro nigiri?  Stringy and tough.\n\nOn top of it all, I ventured out and tried the hamachi kama.  Not bad, but terrible for $20.  In San Diego, you can get the same size hamachi kama with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  There is no excuse, honestly.  If you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  Half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.\n\nNobu isn't a complete loss, though.  Like I stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  It comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than I remembered it being last time.  We also tried the miso almond cake and edamame ice cream, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea ice cream that is the bento.  Never be tempted to order a different dessert here at Nobu.  Ever.\n\nSame goes with the black cod.  Yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  It should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).\n\nOne item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  Perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but I could taste that warm sweet flavor that I know is associated with high quality freshness.  Gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  The set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  Still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!\n\nI also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  Can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  Wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  I highly recommend that you get it served hot.\n\nWhile I maintain an A-OK for Nobu, I doubt I'll be coming back.  There are other places to get better Japanese food--and for better prices."

The place was filled but was almost dead when it hit 9pmish. I don't think it's hard to dine here without reservation depending on time.\n\nAs a person who is a sushi addict, the sushi bar is where we preferred to sit. The chef was very accommodating and all smiles. All cold dish is ordered thru the chef, hot dishes are ordered with the waiter.\n\nRice: thicker grain compared to regular sushi rice w/ very very minimal vinegar.\n\nTop Recommendations:\n*Yellowtail with jalapeno! The mini jalapeno was not spicy, but gave a nice crunch with the yellowtail texture.\n\n*Cod with miso! The miso is delicately sweet which enhances the melt in your mouth cod. The recommendation of this dish is not to be downplayed!\n\n*Uni shooter WITH sake. It's a pretty large shot glass and worth it. I hate the taste of alcohol but even tho this shooter has sake, it was sweet.\n\n*Barracuda with miso and vinaigrette  (off the menu). The chef was actually preparing this for another table when we asked what it was. And behold, he said it's not on the menu!! (This is why sitting at the bar is awesome!) Glad we tried this. The sweet miso flavor and tang really made this fish stand out.\n\nOther nigiri tried: mackerel, kohada, uni (sea urchin), sweet ebi (shrimp), octopus, tuna, tamago (egg), toro. These were pretty good and some above average, but not enough for me to order again if I ever visit again (except maybe if they still have otoro).\n\nDessert: mochi ice cream. Kinda worth it if you're in the mood, but it tastes just like the mochi ice cream sold in supermarkets.\n\nI was iffy between 3 or 4 stars. I'll be nice and keep it at 4 because service was nice. My gripe is the price!! Ugh almost paid just as much here vs a michelin star sushi restaurant in SF which was superb quality compared to Nobu. I felt ripped off when i found out their uni (sea urchin) came from Cali and not Japan. C'mon Nobu! It's not hard to get sushi from Japan, esp for the price you're charging. \n\nVerdict: eat here if you want above average sushi with creative dishes-- and just because you're in vegas!! But if you are a die hard sushi fan like I am, you know you can get better top knotch quality sushi at a way cheaper price."

I was kind of expecting a lot of fancy appetizers, a bunch of cleverly named rolls, and fusiony kinda stuff, but the menu was actually pretty straight.  Omakase is the way to go.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the sashimi here is top notch - very very fresh.  I heard that they cryogenically flash freeze the toro for freshness and it shows.  The cuts of Toro here was excellent - marbelized and tender.\r\n\r\nThe jalapeno hamachi appetizer thing was really really good as well.  I'll have to start remembering these dish names, seriously.  But just look for jalapeno on the menu, you can't miss it.\r\n\r\nMy big gripe witht his joint is that the prices are through the roof, and the portions are miniscule.

As we understood it, the 1st level is a sampling of their menu items, whereas the 2nd level allows for more creativity (and better ingredients) by  your chefs. Maybe it was being in Vegas, but why not - we're at Nobu! High roll it all the way! Our courteous waiter proceeded to ask us if there was anything that we were allergic to or simply did not like. While I'm game for anything, i appreciated the question.\n\nWe were surprised to receive a complimentary appetizer (I think because we were first timers - and duh, we ordered the most expensive option on the menu already!) of the Spicy Miso Chips with tuna tartar - Excellent! It was followed by 4 succulent cold dishes, a peach sorbet to 'clean our palettes', 3 mouthwatering hot dishes, a clear clam broth, a plate of nigiri and then a deliciously light chocolate dessert (i dont even know how to describe it, and i was raised in a bakery!) with fresh berries made special by the pastry chef. These were plates PER PERSON. I won't go into the details of each plate cuz there were too many, and none of it is on the menu anyway since they make it up for you on that day - but we were literally in HEAVEN. Time stopped still and it wasn't till we walked out that I realized we had been there for 3 hours!\n\nI kid you not, everything that I ate here that night, my tastebuds had NEVER tasted before. Even the exotic nigiri was a whole 'nother level of meat. My Nobu experience was completely unique of anything i've ever had.  While its a pricey meal, it's one that I will gladly shell out for"

We got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. Our Waiter Jeffrey was on point. Best service. He recommended we start with the Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno. It was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. LOL. It was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. We also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. A lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but It was still good. We also had a sear salmon sashimi which I do not remember the name that was excellent. We got spicy edamame, Beef Kushiyaki, the Black Cod with Miso and the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. The Cod was really good and highly recommended. The Wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. We literally could have kept ordering food. We had a couple of nice cocktails as well. \n\nAfter dinner they brought us out a plate with Happy Birthday with a choc cake and green icecream. We also ordered the Whiskey Moose. Both desserts were to die for and I was in Heaven. \n\nWhat a fun place to go. You have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. Come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. Yes please!"

I will credit them for serving a real Salmon Roll, whereas many sushi places use pieces of meat that has been broiled/burnt, this was real salmon skin, just like the good places do it.\n\nThe prices are really astronomical...and given that they all buy their fish from the same place(s), pretty ridiculous.  Hey, I've had sushi in Japan with businesses, and even paid for it one time -- a vertiginous buying experience that will affirm to you that Amex truly does have no credit limit on your card -- so I do know good and even great sushi.

I have been to one in NY before, and this was as good or probably better, but maybe its just a more recent and therefore more vivid memory.\n\nWell I went for the upper tier Omakase, and did not regret it.  All of it was great, and I highly recommend the Omakase particularly if you upgrade to the tier 2 dinner.  Wow.  The sushi was great too - one really stole the show and needed an encore performance for my table - that was the Barracuda.  Never had anything like it.  Sometimes I have dreams about those pieces of Barracuda.\n\nThe dinner was complemented with a Kirin Zero (alcohol free beer), and a ginger beer.  The drinks were outstanding. I have never had a Kirin Zero before, but will seek it out in the future.\n\nIf you are staying in the Hard Rock, or want some Omakase, hit it up.  You will not regret it.  Oh yeah...  Bring your Mastercard.  Because memories may be priceless, but the dinner has a price, and this one isn't cheap!"

It will start subtly, build up anticipation, then rock you with the chorus, keep you there for a while, and slowly let you down.  This is true of any good thing, a good book, a good time, a good movie, and life if you do it all right.  If you understand this principle, then the same is applicable with a good meal.  I made the mistake ordering the Chef's Choice during my one and last visit to Nobu on one of my many excursions to Vegas.  The anticipation of eating here is enough with all the effort required just to get in the door of this place.  When you do walk in, you will be dazzled.  Everything is beautiful here, the paint on the walls, the sculptures you'll pass on your way to being seated, the kitchen, the staff, and even the patrons.  And when you finally do get your first course, you will feel as if you just might be taken to a place you have never been before.  It is so good.  But then the rest of the meal just doesn't follow the principle mentioned above.  The order of things was wrong.  Some courses didn't build on the last.  By the time you finish the last course, you can't remember the first.  Because taken as a whole the meal is forgettable.  Now my friends that ordered entrees coupled with various sushi plates, their meals were wonderful.  But it is a big disappointment especially since the Chef's Choice is Nobu's flagship dish and most expensive item.  You are ultimately left with an empty experience afterwards.  Which is the case with the whole experience at Nobu.  It ended up being empty which had a lot to do with the content of my stomach after the meal.  As it too was empty.  I can see where Nobu get's its reputation.  You'll be able to see this too when you walk into this place.  But you will also be able to see that a lot of that is due to style and has little to do with sustenance (pun intended)."

The drunk guy passed out on the table next to us provided some decent entertainment until he was escorted out. \n\nThe first two courses were delicious...simple sashimi and sushi samples.  Excellent quality fish.\n\nThe much raved-about rock shrimp and black cod courses were pretty disappointing.  The shrimp was slathered in a mayonnaise-y sauce that probably should've been a side dipping sauce.  So creamy.  Too creamy.  Took all the finesse out of what could've been a delicated, beautiful shrimp dish.  However, if you love mayonnaise.  Then you'll like it.   The miso cod was good for a bite or two...but then was just too sweet.  Almost sweeter than the dessert that followed...which was pretty yummy.  \n\nSo overall, it was OK.  If you want good quality and a full stomach for a decent price, I'd rather go to Wicked Spoon, Bachannal, or one of the other higher-end buffets."

            "review": "I don't even know why I'm writing this stupid review.  You're gonna go to Nobu regardless of what I write so why the heck am I even bothering?\n\nWhy are you going to go?  I'll give you 3 reasons:\n\n1)  REASONABLY WELL PREPARED DISHES\nThe fish is usually reasonably fresh because they crank out so much sushi nightly that every day new fish really has to be brought in.  The sauces used for any fish or meat dish are well balanced, savory, & time-tested - no need to worry about overly salty ponzu sauces or overbearingly sweet plum sauces.  A couple of key dishes to try, to experience what I'm talking about include:\n-- Toro Tartar in Ponzu:  The ponzu the toro floats in is deliciously well made & is practically sipable after finishing the fish & the accompanying American Sturgeon caviar.  The ponzu doesn't utterly overshadow the delectable saltiness of the caviar which is surprising.\n-- Kumamoto Oysters:  If you're one of those \"these shells are so small\" types, skip this dish.  This is for those that appreciate truly flavorful & tasty oysters - not beefy, characterless ones.  With these oysters, you can also appreciate the different sauce pairings the chef provides \n\n2)  THE \"IN\" or \"COOL PLACE\" TO GO\nGuys - there's a lot of talent here so wear the good jeans.  Not that you're gonna hook up during your meal, but I'm just sayin' - it's doesn't hurt having legs-&-heels all around you.  Additionally, if you've got the coin & you come with your boys, passing plates around to try different dishes is cool.  As long as, again, you've got the coin because per person, this place is a good $100 easy so a group of 4 with sake can eclipse $500 after tip.   \nLadies- you're gonna get a lot of looks here & that's even before the sake goggles go on so if you're at ease with yourself enough to admit being the attention whore that you are, you're gonna love every minute of it.  Men constantly trot over from one table to another to \"say hi\" & guys without both style & money rarely bother going to Nobu.\n\n3)  CONVENIENT\nGoin' to a concert at the Joint?  Nobu's.  Goin' to Body English at 11PM?  Nobu's.  Gonna hang out at the Circle Bar?  Nobu's.  Gonna hit the tables later?  Nobu's.  Nobu's is the defacto restaurant to go to now that AJ's has shut down, Ago is kinda 'meh', & Pink Taco is better if you're just leisurely screwin' around.\n\nWARNING #1:  NOBU'S SAKE LABEL\nFor sake rookies, please read:  Unlike most sushi restaurants, Nobu only has available his own sake label.  The sake behind Nobu's is actually the product of the Hokusetsu brewery in Niigata prefecture Japan, a cold but famous region of Honshu known for making ultra-refined but sometimes 'water-ish' & unpronounced sake.  If you want to get the most value from your sake purchase, DO NOT purchase the \"YK35\" or even the \"YK50\" for consuming while eating your other dishes, unless you plan on having just straight nigiri & none of those 'hot dishes'.  The fact is that the sake is so light & minimal in character that you won't taste any of it over your \"ponzu-laden tuna tataki\" & you might as well get something with a more earthy nuance like the Hokusetsu Onigoroshi which is much cheaper & something you can appreciate the taste of with a flavorful meal.\n\nWARNING #2:  TOURISTY BAMBOO SAKE DECANTERS\nFor sake snobs:  They're gonna serve the sake in one of those novelty bamboo tokkuri by default.  Have them serve it in something else that's glass or ceramic.  Due to the porous/fiberous nature of the bamboo material, I don't believe these tokkuri get washed adequately & I've experienced very high variance - particularly in the nose - between YK35 served in the bamboo versus ceramic, for example.\n\nWARNING #3:  GET RESERVATIONS\nTips to the hostesses won't matter.  If they don't have room, they don't have room.  Not even your host is gonna be able to squeeze you & your boys in if there's no tables available.\n\nWARNING #4:  OMAKASE DOESN'T MATTER\nIf you actually know something about sushi, you'll agree:  The $150 Omakase at Nobu is really not that interesting or creative, nor is it that radically different from ordering  straight off the menu.  I've been going to Nobu for business dinners since before Simon was built across from it (which is now Ago) & contrary to what some other reviewers are raving about, there's VERY LITTLE that's innovative about Nobu's sushi or sashimi.  They might change up the fish in their sashimi tataki dishes or add some caviar here & there but at the end of the day, it's all the same - because the chef's don't have much time to care, & some of them actually aren't all that experienced.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAs sushi-on/near-the-strip goes, this is about as good as it gets.  Other restaurants may try to clone Nobu's dishes (like the toro tartar) but very consistently, the quality of fish/balance in preparation is what shines through @ the original & you'll only learn this with experience so go ahead & try others.  You'll be back.\n\n4-Stars."

The restaurant was packed (on a Tuesday night) and the service was perfect. Totally attentive and choreographed without being annoying. My husband and I split the $150 omakase for two and ordered two other specials to go along with it and it was a feast. Our favorites were the yellowtail special, the lobster (split and restuffed with panko and chili), and the monkfish liver with caviar. But it was all good. Amazing ingredients, beautiful to look at, and nothing that we could ever come close to making for ourselves at home."

Don't get me wrong - I love sushi - but don't eat fish.\n\nPart of a vacation, a good friend (a meat-eater and self-denied foodie) found this place as our go to for a serious Las Vegas food experience.  He had lived in NYC and eaten at that location - and knew that the Hard Rock location had a lot to live up to.  It didn't let either of us down.\n\nIn fact, it was so good, that even at $100 per person we seriously considered going back the next night.\n\nIt's been some time, so in all fairness I'm having trouble remembering the specific ingredients in the dishes, but know that each course was a sensory experience.  Some were for touch, some for smell, most for sight, some for sound, and ALL for taste.  The flavors were incredible - hitting many of the core flavors in every single bite.  Sweet, salt, spice, hot, cold, acidic, creamy - just writing this makes me want to jump on a plane tonight to try to catch the last seating.  And the sake!  Oh, the sake :)\n\nIf I were to knock off even 1 star, it'd be because it's a little ways off the strip - at the Hard Rock.  So if you're totally strip-centric, maybe not your best bet.  It also felt a little cold - we definitely were not seated at the most comfortable table, but none looked uber posh.  And of the 6 courses I was served, one felt sub par.\n\nBut believe me - the level of service, the quality of ingredients and the expert preparation made this one of the top 3 meals in my life."

My favorite was the first dish, their signature yellowtail sashimi with jalape\u00f1o. I do agree with other reviewers who said the sashimi was a bit thin, but wow did it taste great. The dessert dish was a close second favorite. It included a molten chocolate cake, green tea ice cream, and a whiskey-infused cappuccino-like dessert. My least favorite was the assorted sushi dish that included a california roll and six pieces of nigiri (tuna, salmon, and snapper). Every other dish was unique and full of flavor, while this assorted sushi dish was average at best.\n\nAside from the five-course meal, we also ordered their popular cucumber martini. It was a strong little drink with a fantastically fresh aroma. I don't often love the scent of alcohol but this drink was a definite exception.\n\nWe had a very satisfying experience overall. Although slow at times, the service was great and every dish was thoroughly explained. The manager was also quite nice and stopped to speak with us for a moment.\n\nWe weren't entirely stuffed by the end of our five courses, but we were full enough. Overall, the food-tasting was a true experience and definitely worth a try, but this isn't a place I would frequent due to their notably high prices. To sum up my review - if you're into high quality Japanese tapas-like dishes and can easily afford the heady price point, this place is for you!"

Initially, I was a little skeptical of Nobu because it is part of a chain of restaurants. Being a little hungover, a friend and I decided to go since it was within our hotel, the Hard Rock. Despite the restaurant sits in the middle of the desert, the seafood is quite fresh.\n\nThe few things that we did try were really good. However, I didn't order away and try as many things as I have wanted to. I had my basic sushi which were hamachi, ikura, and unagi nigiri. Then I had my spicy hotate handroll. I was a little full after that but my friend and I ordered two warm dishes. The calamari pasta should not be missed but the yellowtail collar was slightly overcooked. I wish I had room for their specialty which is the black cod in miso but the calling of my hotel bed and urges of sleep were way too strong for me to resist."

            "review": "[Michelin Star #11]\n\nNight one of my three-day Vegas Michelin dining binge brought me to Nobu.  The occasion:  friend's birthday.  \n\nUpon arrival, we were led through a crowded dining room full of boisterous patrons drinking sake and beer to a table at which we were rubbing elbows with the parties around us.  First things first:  this place is not where you want to go for an elegant Japanese meal, but it is perfect for bigger groups.  \n\nWhen our waiter arrived, he took our drink orders, then instead of announcing any specials, he told us that for a group of our size, he \"strongly recommended\" that we do family style.  He said it in a tone that left no other option.  Of course family style makes sense, but it seems to me that an establishment with Nobu's reputation (and Michelin star!) should be far more accommodating to its patrons.  But I do understand that it is likely difficult to navigate one's way through such a crowded restaurant with the myriad of plates that accompany most Japanese meals.\n\nMy group opted for the omakase.  We were brought a nice variety of both hot and cold dishes, raw and cooked.  The highlight of the meal was the miso black cod.  The dish was placed in the center of the table, and following this was an unanimous chorus of approval as we each tasted this delectable morsel;  definitely umami.  I also enjoyed the nicely seasoned yellowtail sashimi a great deal, but it wasn't the best yellowtail I've had by far.  The rest of the dishes were less memorable, but still well executed.  The final few courses consisted of rolls whose fish to rice ratio was unreasonably high - yeah, I could tell they were trying to fill me up.  \n\nWere I to rate the food alone, Nobu would be a solid four star establishment.  But Nobu is a Michelin rated restaurant, and I'd like to rate it by Michelin standards.  These places, in my experience, don't pack their diners in like sardines, and especially don't have patronizing waiters.  I enjoyed my experience at Nobu, but the enjoyment was more about the company than the restaurant itself.  \n\nI've been told that Nobu's other locations are much classier than the one on the Vegas strip.  If that's the case, then shame on those Michelin guys for giving this particular location a star."

I chose Nobu based on New York's location and Philadelphia's Morimoto restaurant, but ended up being very underwhelmed. The black cod was a standout as is the case in most Japanese restaurants, straight from the ocean fresh, with a flavorful miso sauce. My seafood toban yaki was disappointing though, my favorite dish at Morimoto just didn't live up to expectation at Nobu. The broth was super salty and the quantity of seafood was just sort of lacking.\n\nOverall the restaurant has a very hip and trendy vibe, our waiters were friendly and attentive without being overbearing, but all in all just a \"blah\" experience for a 25th birthday celebration."

Our drink order was lost about 2 times.\n\n8:28pm - Still waiting for the menu...after asking about 2 times already (*WAVE WAVE* trying to get a waiter's attention.)  I just wanted the menu.

We sent back the teriyaki and wanted to leave ASAP after the bill came.  \n\nThe 3rd star is for the waiter's apology and help with the bill.

I'm not a frequenter of the Hard Rock (because either you stay there or you have to cab it from the strip - and I ain't made o' money people), but last time I was there I had to stop in and try the (in)famous Nobu!\n\nNow ... to be fair I had no idea this place was famous (the rock I live under doesn't get the food channel), and I thought it was mostly a sushi place (which it isn't - according to the waiter), but I had a great time anyway. \n\nAs soon as you sit down the waiter comes and tells you about the place and what they do. Apparently they cater the menu to the group on the table etc. I wouldn't know that because we actually never got a menu. The waiter told us about the famous Omakase (where the chef's send you what they want for ridiculous amounts of money) and we were sold!! \n\nWe got three different tears of Omakase - $110, $125 & $150 - so that we could try a little bit of everything. It's an 8 course array of hot and cold dishes. If you get this, prepare to wait ... it took us a solid 2 hours to get through the 8 courses - which gets you full and drunk if you're drinking like we were (the sake comes in cute tea pots and the plum wine is amazing). \n\nI will say that the best bang for your buck is definitely the $125 dollar option. It's worth the $15 upgrade. The $150 option is when you can tell they're trying a little too hard to be different (food doesn't have to be unpronounceable, it just has to be good). \n\nMost of the dishes were actually pretty good - but there were a few that were underwhelming (the hot dishes in particular were not great - and those were the ones the waiter said they were known for). I did enjoy the pallet cleansers a lot though. \n\nThe great thing about a place like Nobu is that no matter how fancy it is, it's still in the hard rock, and you'll still find a group of bachelors blowing up penis balloons and sending them flying around the restaurant (one even hit  me on the back of the head - war wounds are sexy!)."

I am a person who likes to consider myself a huge food critic and fanatic, and was repulsed by my meal at Nobu in Vegas.\n\nFirst, we tried the restaurants \"most popular cold dish\" the yellow tail with jalapeno.  It was saturated in soy sauce with a splash of rice vinegar. How is that in any way shape or form a dish worthy of being proclaimed a restaurant favorite. My 2 year old niece could have whooped up that concoction in her plastic kitchen.  As someone who is considered a culinary marvel by many of her friends, that was such an insult to my palate and my wallet.\n\nNext, the toban yaki was so repulsive, I couldn't honestly finish my meal. There were two shiitake mushrooms, 2 pieces of shrimp, 1 scallop, and 2 pieces of calamari  in a hot pot drenched in sake with a pinch of brown sugar, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. WOW it tasted like the essence of Lysol. There were no complicated flavors and the presentation was so amateur, I felt utterly pissed that we trekked down to the Hard Rock for a meal unworthy of Benihanas...yes please note the sarcasm.\n\nFinally, they brought out the beef tenderloin...my God it was at that point that we asked him to forget about our sushi and the rest of the meal, paid for the check, and walked out. They took a delicious, beautiful piece of tenderloin and threw it into a hot pot with the same horrid sake, soy sauce concoction as the seafood travesty.\n\nTake it from someone who LOVES and ENJOYS fine dining to the highest degree - this place was horrendous! I give it 1 star because I have to actually rate it with something. I will never eat at another Nobu establishment for the rest of my life...and unless you feel like sitting in a loud club with layered seating, amateur service and food, head to one of the better fine dining establishments on the strip. I hear McDonalds makes a mean Big Mac."

I was so upset when it was all gone.\n\n//Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce// $24\nExtra crispy and battered to extreme perfection. The addicting crunch makes it so wonderful. Subtle spices and perfectly creamy. Make sure to eat it with the spicy arugula and sweet baby greens underneath - they really add in another dimension of flavor! \n\n//Black Cod Miso// $37\nThe dish that put Nobu on the map - Black Cod Miso with pickled ginger root.

The fish was prepared with extreme precision. \n\n//Bento Box// $15\nHappy anniversary written in beautiful script using white chocolate sauce, with a warm molten chocolate fondant cake garnished with berries, shiso syrup, scrumptious green tea ice cream and a surprising, rich expresso soaked tiramisu topped with a Nobu emblem cracker. They were all beyond perfection.

It may also happen to be the most expensive sushi on the planet, but it if you love sushi, it is worth every penny! \n\nI would be willing to bet that just about anything on the menu is nothing short of amazing, but my favorites included the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalape\u00f1o, garnished with cilantro (which they also offer as a roll) and the Spicy Scallop Roll. Now one of the cool things about Nobu is that not only do they know how to do sushi, but they have perfected a number of imported Kobe/Wagyu beef dishes as well. My favorite was the Wagyu Beef Tataki, which is thinly sliced (similar to sashimi), perfectly marbled, lightly seared beef that requires little to no chewing...I'm telling you, it literally melts in your mouth! My drink of choice was a very refreshing Pineapple Martini, which was the perfect balance to the spice of much of our food selections--if you like a sweet drink, I highly recommend it!\n\nThe atmosphere is what I would call \"high class-zen\" with river rocks, bamboo and ambient lighting abound...and it's even more hip and beautiful at night! Vegas has a ton of great restaurants, but if you find yourself with a sushi craving in Sin City, do yourself a favor and rush on over to Nobu...and if your mouth doesn't water over raw fish, head over anyway...it's sure to be one of your best dining experiences in the city!"

At first I thought that steak might be a good idea, but I love Asian food and wanted a great experience. My boyfriend and I walked into Nobu, a Japanese restaurant. For our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.\n\nTheir menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. We decided to go with a little bit of everything.\n\nOur favorite was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. Their tempura shrimp and vegetables were great also.\n\nOverall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. I can't say much about their food because I have to say that I've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, Well Being in the Box.\n\nAlthough their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the Guam experience as we could get. It was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.\n\nI honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. That was majority of our bill. I do believe that their signature bento box dessert was worth 14 dollars. It was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea ice cream was just like home.\n\nIf you want something other than tempura for your experience at Nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. For myself, a good Japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way I've had it in Japan and on Guam from top Japanese chefs. However, this was not the case, unfortunately.\n\nI give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars."

For every dish that we  ordered, I could list a superior counterpart at Japonais or Sunda in Chicago for a fraction of the cost.\n\nAlso of note is the fact that our waiter initially remarked that sashimi orders came as two pieces, but when we got our bill, we noted that our four bite-sized slices of otoro came to a total of $76.  The wagyu was also incredibly overpriced for what we got; apparently each ounce is $30 or so and the minimum order is 2 ounces.  \n\nMaybe it was the sheer excellence of the previous night's meal, but we left feeling we had blown $350 on a very unsatisfactory experience.

What was great about the service - that they brought the dish, explained it and then left us alone to enjoy food w/o constantly checking in w/ us - also turned out to be an issue.  When we were ready to order more sake, we waited over 15 minutes, and, when no server had come to our table, my friend got up and found one to take our order.\n\nThe food this time was also a disappointment.  The rock shrimp tempura wasn't as tastey as always, and the sushi rolls were just ordinary.  Certainly not good enough for Nobu prices.  The Miso Cod and Yellow Tail Sashimi were both delicious, but the others were sub-par for Nobu's reputation.\n\nSometimes, I'm not sure it's a good thing to have all the big name restaurants in Vegas... if the big name chefs are elsewhere, the Vegas fare seems to suffer."

A little excessive yes, but it was effective.  The first couple of rounds of the omakase were the cold dishes, which were acceptable, as I expected small portions of dishes to come out.  However, I was surprised (and almost annoyed with the second half of the omakase, which consisted of warm dishes that basically over-powering and excessive.  They could pretty much act as their own entree.\n\ntl;dr  The cold dishes are tiny, the warm dishes are a whole lot.\n\nWith that said, the price of $110 is worth the 8-course meal, but I was slightly annoyed at how small and then how big the proportions were.

Too many snooty drunk people, talking way too loudly. I couldn't even have a conversation with my friends.

I'm from So Cal, so logically, I want to eat at one of my favorite places when I'm visiting in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the experience in Vegas was completely different then SD. My friend and I went down to the sushi bar around 10:00 pm to eat some fresh rolls and my favorite, rock dynamite shrimp. I was amazed that everything came out in less the 5 mins. Afterwards, I felt like I was chewing on sand. My stomach started to hurt and I felt violently ill. My friend ended up with the same symptoms. I called Nobu to tell them about what happened and our \"ill\" experience and no one ever called me back or even acknowledged the issue. I would not recommend this restaurant or location when you are visiting in Vegas. \n\nAn update to this review... My friend spent three days in the Desert Springs Hospital due to food poisoning. I tried calling the manager George Lypton as well as going into the restaurant to update him on my friend's condition. I was supposed to be on a plane and return to Cali, instead I had to extend my stay resulting in more hotel fees and airfare loss. I received a very unsympathetic voicemail that George turned the incident over to his insurance. He doesn't know my friend's name, her number, etc. she was taken by ambulance via a 911 call and he couldn't even follow up on her health or mine? DO NOT eat at NOBU unless you want to be hospitalized!"

I should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being Japanese, I wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  We had reservations at 9 PM and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  It was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  Also, the crowd was much older than I anticipated.  The interior had a nice Asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.\n\nFor starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar with caviar, and tempura.  The menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  I wish the menu would have included more details.  We got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  We ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  The order came with 2 pieces each.  I liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  Also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  Most places give you barely enough sauce.  For dinner, we shared the sushi dinner which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (tuna roll).  The sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  Also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  Fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  That ruined my dinner.\n\nWe decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an Asian restaurant.  We tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  It came with soy caramel glaze and edamame ice cream.  The cake was yummier than I expected.  \n\nOverall, it was not as good as I expected but I'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service."

However, it just did not live up to my expectations.\n\nThe sushi was just so-so, I could have gotten it at any decent sushi place in the bay area.  Definitely not $100 meal kind of sushi.  Maybe it's because I didn't order the Omakase menu like most people who like this place, but I would think that when you're spending the kind of money you do at this place, even their regular dishes should be a cut above the rest, but they were not.\n\nThis is also the first place where I ever sent anything back.  The staff recommended a drink (some apple concoction) that turned out to be just terrible.  I'm not at all discriminating when it comes to alcoholic beverages (if it has alcohol and I can keep it down, fine by me!), but this drink was just so horrible that I couldn't take more than a couple of sips.\n\nAnother minus was the restaurant not having its own restrooms (had to go outside to the casino), which just sucked.  This place just did not seem worth the money at all, and I don't think I'll be back."

I wish I was a celebrity so I wouldn't have to wait so damn long to eat in your wickedly awesome dining establishment! I simultaneously loathe and love you...in a platonic sort of way, of course...\n\nNobu (in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino) is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I've also been to Matsuhisa's in Los Angeles, but there's nothing like the Nobu experience. It's Vegas baby!!\n\nAnyway, I've found that it's so much easier to make reservations at Nobu if you're actually staying in the hotel (which is awesome, by the way). One of my college roommates' sisters used to work there and hooked me up with a discounted suite on two occasions...SCORE! It also doesn't help if you're pretty slick with the pass-the-twenty-as-you-shake-the-host/hostess'-hand-in-order-to-get-a-table-faster bit. Never worked for me...kept dropping the money...\n\nBack to the food: pricey? Abso-friggin'-lutely! Take one look at the place. Nice furniture, kitschy bamboo sake bottles and cups, rice paper wall paneling, indoor bamboo plants, wall inlaid with black river stones, huge sushi bar, and you mustn't forget about the main ingredient: location, location, location. The Hard Rock is practically a sure-fire way to keep this place packed with gorgeous-looking people. They need some way to pay the rent, right?\n\nBut is the food tasty? Hells to the yeah, it is! Every single dish I've ever had here has been delicious...even the ones that I'm usually not too keen on were better than other places (mirugai for example: here = tasty; other sushi places = like chewing on a salted piece of bicycle tire). The sea bass is prepared very well (nice and moist, flaky too), the rock shrimp is fried to perfection, the sashimi is beautifully presented, and the tataki is to die for...*sigh* if only I could be there right now... Their desserts are just as good as their appetizers and entrees. The last time I was there they had a passion fruit sorbet that could knock you out with its incredible flavor (oooh...my mouth's watering just thinking about it...and now I've drooled on my keyboard...how embarrassing...).\n\nAs I mentioned before, this place can get pricey. But, if you have the funds and the stomach for it, you have to go with the omakase (chef's choice). Tip: let your server know what you're partial to and what doesn't exactly float your boat in the food department (I'm not a big fan of uni (sea urchin), so I let 'em know that...thanks Nobu!). I believe there are different levels to the omakase dinner, too...at least there was the last time I visited. But, if omakase's not the thing for you, go a la carte...that way you can try a variety of Nobu's offerings. It's all up to you.\n\nSince Nobu's in a Vegas hot-spot, be prepared for celebrity sightings as well. The first time I ate there, my wife and I were seated next to a group of porn stars (they had to be with their excessively tight and skimpy clothing, the gratuitous cleavage (both male and female), the over-tanned, near-leather quality to their skin, and (of course) the cowboy hats!) C'mon! Who wears a cowboy hat in a Japanese restaurant while wearing practically nothing?! Porn stars! That's who! I also walked past ex-San Francisco 49er quarterback Jeff Garcia, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, Enrique Iglesias, and Enrique Iglesias' mole (pre-divorce, that is).\n\nEvery visit to Nobu is like dinner and a show! I think that alone gives me my money's worth."

What is not to love?) \n\nCourse 2: Shima Aji Sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (I'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!) \n\nCourse 3: Bluefin tuna sashimi topped with garlic puree and sliced jalapeno, served with jalapeno emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! You know I like spice in my life!) \n\nCourse 4: Tasmanian trout trout and seared sweet shrimp sashimi salad served with mache, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only I could find this in DC) \n\nCourse 5: Pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in yuzu soy sauce \n\nCourse 6: Grilled washu beef with eared foie gras, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction \n\nCourse 7: Soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - HUGE); Loved the little enoki mushrooms in it! \n\nCourse 8: Sushi: One standout for me - salt water eel with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil and lemon together. Wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). Not that the other offerings weren't good. \n\nCourse 9: Dessert. Panna Cotta (I think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was AWESOME! \n\nFinal: Three types of fruit sake. My favorite was the ginger. \n\nI have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again."

Unfortunately,  I probably wouldn't eat here again... just because I'm not a fan of all night long gastrointestinal misery... and because there are so many other options in Vegas."

And my BF was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. It was actually perfect timing that this Groupon became available because I was going to be in Vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* Anyways, I made reservations for 2 at 6PM online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. The Groupon can only be used at the Nobu inside the Hard Rock hotel. There's also a Nobu inside Caeser's Palace. Once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in Japanese! The decor inside was really nice and elegant. I really liked the bamboo wall they had. I also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder. \n\nOk onto the food! So we started off with some edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. Next came the best sashimi I had ever had in my life! Its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. The flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. Yumm!!! I can probably eat like five more of that dish. :P The next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the shrimp tempura. I was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at Japanese restaurants. The dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. It was rich and creamy. And the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. Next came their black cod dish. My BF absolutely loved this one and I can see why. It was so flakey and cooked to perfection. The fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. Next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. This dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. But it was still tasty. And lastly we got our dessert! It was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. OMG...so good!!! The green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. The cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 desserts because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. The chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. Overall, everything we tried was excellent! The reason why I subtracted 1 star was because both my BF and I felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. Otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. I'm so happy to get to try Nobu for the first time! =) So go get your Groupon, while it's still available peeps!!"

My friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all I know is that I wanted to gag. \n\nAlso we asked for two orders of the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and they put both orders on one plate. That is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? The math does not add up.

My cousin and I have heard so much about the place we HAD to try it with our mother's during our mother/daughter trip to Vegas.  Here is what we ordered\n\nYellowtail w/ jalapeno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=DwKr-LhPVr9kFIVr4Q7PtQ: Very Delicious, my mother and cousin who do not eat sashimi even enjoyed the dish. After the dinner when I asked them what their favorite dish was this was on the top. It is slices of yellowtail sashimi w/ a type of ponzu sauce and good to eat with the small slice of jalapeno and cilantro. I think I've had similar dishes like this at other restaurants but I think b/c its from Nobu it just makes it that much better. \n\nSashimi Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=12QbNH80NCNJdBy_mZVnOg): The dressing on this salad was very good and tasty. It comes with mixed greens in the middle and like seared ahi layering the outside. I wish it had a couple of different types of Sashimi in the salad but that's okay, it still tasted good. \n\nScallops with filo on lettuce cups (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=NK22wem6XYcmO21jvgPJVQ): This was probably my favorite dish. The scallop melted in your mouth and the taste was pretty good. I think the scallops were made with a miso sauce and had green onions sprinkled on top. Whatever it was it was super super good. ahhh drool.\n\nWhole deep fried cod or snapper I don't remember the name of the fish on top of sauteed veggies in a miso butter sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=vefN4PoI2zsBDZNyHZaAXQ): This was another special. The waiter told us that everyone raves about this dish. It came out and we were all in awe. It was pretty big. The table was in WOW when my mother and my auntie started laughing... they then asked one of the waiters how much it was $100.00.. WOW, didn't realize that when we ordered it. I think it should have been something that the waiter said, especially since it cost so much.  Needless to say the fish was delicious! You can eat almost every single piece of it. The fins where crunchy and were very good dipped in the miso butter sauce. The sauce was sweet with a little spicy. The sauteed veggies were also very good and eaten with the fish heavenly. We picked at this dish the whole dinner and still weren't able to eat the whole thing.  Bummer b/c we definitely tried, we knew we had to get our moneys worth if we were going to spend $100 on one dish. \n\nSushi and the Tempura Dinner: Nothing spectacular about either of these dishes. I don't even remember what rolls we got except for the house roll which wasn't anything special. I would definitely skip both if you are coming here. Get these at some other restaurant. \n\nThe service was good but not spectacular. They have a lot of people working here but nobody went out of their way to enhance our experience. \n\nOverall I would come here again. There are a couple other things I would like to try off their menu."

(As an aside, the Caesar's Palace location is newer and busier but given that this is the original Vegas location, it appears more logical to start here if you have never experience Nobu before.) \n\nGiven that we were not famished, we asked the waitress to help us craft a light menu that still allowed us to experience Chef Matsuhisa. We started off with mocktails followed by Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalape\u00f1o (which had just the right kick and freshness). Then we had the New Style Sashimi (Salmon), followed by Black Cod, and finally two sushi rolls, the soft shell crab and shrimp tempura. Overall, the dishes were varied, flavorful, and yet light. \n\nWe ended the night with recommended dessert - Sata Andagi - which I was admittedly unsure about upfront - however, after experiencing it, I was surprised I had never tried such an amazing dessert combination before. The Apricot Doughnut was one of the best desserts I've had and was perfectly complimented by white chocolate crumbs and the black tea ice cream. \n\nOverall, the ambiance, vibe, and service was a great foundation for a memorable meal at the original Las Vegas Nobu.

Everything you've heard about Nobu is true!  I read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent Vegas trip.\nSo we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  I ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  But I think the mango was the better of the two!  \nSo, me being a newbie on the sushi scene I was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be GOOD!!! OMG, even bf, who isn't really down with tuna, was floored.  The tuna had scallions in the middle I believe....whatever it was delish!  And the sauce it had was SOOOO GOOD, I don't even know what it was, I should've asked.  OK, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree.\nNext, we ordered the soft shell crab roll was again a mystery.  Was a very welcome bite to my mouth, I don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  The crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it! \nAlso on our table was the shrimp tempura roll, I know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  Never mind that, this roll was a fave!  I also ordered another plate of this little roll because I loved it SO MUCH!  Again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  The amazingness of this is too good to put into words......I AGAIN don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but I honestly feel like going there again, like NOW.  \nSo for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  It came out and looked like little donut holes!  Was so good!  They were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. Little bites of fried heaven!  \nAs for service-stellar! She was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when I asked about rolls.  That's OK, I walked out very happy!"

BUT I decided to give this another try in Vegas and man am I glad I did!!\n\nWe were a group of 4 and quite hungry. Kind of a bad mix as you're walking into a notoriously expensive japanese/sushi resto. Now if you're going to dine here this is how you do it.\n\nDon't waste your time ordering a la carte. Give your knowledgeable server a maximum $ amount per head and let him design the menu for you. We were ready to shell out a bit and spend about $100 each excluding alcohol which in the end was the perfect amount to leave completely satisfied. You can tell him a few things for direction (like we had to have the miso cod!) but let him bring out dish after mind blowing dish and you just sit back and enjoy your company. They carefully explain everything that is brought out and whats great is because you are eating the exact same things you get to share in the same experience. \n\nWe also ordered a 60 ounce bottle of Sake and ordering drinks was also something we didn't have to think about for the rest of the night. Our glasses were constantly refilled until the end of our meal and it actually was the perfect amount of drinks for the entire meal which lasted about 2 hours in total....\n\nI can't say we had one thing that wasn't absolutely delicious and unique!\n\nHighly recommend!"

Atmosphere is terrible, decor is very dated, servers are attentive but a little way too salesy, and yes, it's expensive, which in and of itself isn't the problem...the problem lies in the actual VALUE you are getting, which is awful.  I've been to much better sushi restaurants in Portland (Bamboo really resonates right now) and paid 1/4 the price for frankly better sushi.  We actually ate beforehand just bc we didn't want to drop $450 on dinner and wanted to try a few things, my lady is pregnant so she can't drink, and I had A....as in 1, single drink and we had 4 single serving sushi items.  We were there for 20 minutes and our bill was NORTH OF $150.  I get that this restaurant isn't cheap, but cmon, I felt like I was bent over and just plowed in the backside (no lube, this was a dry run) as I was walking out....my lady felt the same.  Would never never never never ever ever ever go back and wouldn't recommend."

I know a lot of people like it. But a sashimi purist such as myself follows the, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" regime. However, new sashimi I tried and it was far from bad. I think it was a seared tuna something in ponzu sauce. I'm going to round up on my stars because it did force me to step outside my box and try something new. \n\nOysters were quite steep. $15 for three kumomoto oysters. My date didn't think that was steep at all; but them Manhattan boys don't love the dollar oyster nights that we love in the Bay Area.\n\nImpressive, but expensive sake list. I didn't partake. And I wouldn't unless date wanted some too. Again, the prices didn't raise his eyebrows. My story about the bottomless sake at Coach in Oakland very much raised his eyebrows.\n\nFood was as expensive as I would expect considering it was a sushi place in Vegas. But, hey, not like I paid, right? A conversation comparing sushi experiences in California to New York was certainly the most priceless part of the experience."

And when we found out there was a Nobu here (see my NYC review since I had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! I was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r\n\r\nThe decor is similar to New York's Nobu, but not as big and not as nice. The service is not as good but it's Vegas so oh well.\r\n\r\nWe ordered:\r\n\r\nPeach Martini and Lychee martini - very good but strong.\r\n\r\nYellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce - This was fucking good. One of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (See below for Kristine N's review). They prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! It was GREAT!\r\n\r\nLobster salad - Of course I had to order this! I love the salad dressing. \r\n\r\nMiso black cod - The cool thing about Nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. This was fantastic and sweet.\r\n\r\nChilean Sea bass w/ mushrooms - The bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not Chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. It was still very good though. YUMMM.\r\n\r\nSquid pasta - I love the squid pasta here. Complimented w/ asparagus. I love asparagus!\r\n\r\nRock shrimp tempura - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. Yummy.\r\n\r\nBento box - flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. This was better than I remembered from NYC. It's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. It was great, and gooey in the middle. \r\n\r\nMango caramel ice-cream dessert - A light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r\n\r\nOne of the girls and I are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (See below for Kristine N.'s review!) That tells ya something! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because I hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r\n\r\nIt was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. By the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r\n\r\nYay, for Nobu!!!"

This would be a great place to start- \n\nHad dinner here while in town for a conference at the beginning of the month with some business acquaintances from out of town- all three of us are pretty familiar with Vegas and what it has to offer- in multiple aspects ! We didn't have to wait- big plus! The server was super knowledgeable of the fish served - and of the menu including the pricing. \n\nThe other two that I had the pleasure of dining with asked our server to recommend a few choices and he did- we all agreed to allow his expertise guide us in our meal. He ordered a few dishes - they were great - and then we requested just one more and he complied. The texture, flavor and presentation were amazing. I have had sushi all over the country and this will be rated in the top 5. The flavors made my palate go insane !! 5 stars on the food ! \n\nSo, a total of 5 dishes for the bargain price of over $250 and that wasn't including a tip. Upon review of the receipt. One dish was charged three times for a mere $18/charge - I questioned the server who politely explained that he took the liberty of ordering three orders of so each of us at the table could have two pieces... I'm sure he did. The other three dishes were on average of $60 ish each- hmm.... One would have thought that he would have had the courtesy to pick a variety of dishes price point speaking - not the highest on the menu OR have the courtesy to ask if our group was on a budget or what our price point was verses assuming. Our tip alone paid for his internet bill for the month in addition to half of his cell phone bill. \n\nOut of courtesy- we all reached for our cards (me slightly cringing at what my accounting people were going to say when they saw this horrifically high dinner for three) and one of the other two decided they would take the heat on the cost... Not sure how he are going to explain that one. \n\nMoral of this story is- always order your own food in Vegas unless you have an unlimited budget! Thus the 4 star rating- minus one star for common courtesy and respecting the client/customer."

What you really want is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, the black cod with miso, and whatever else your perfectly-attentive-but-not-really-there waiter recommends. \n\nNot sure what else I can add that hasn't been said already, but if you're willing to spend the money, Nobu is awesome. \n\nSide note: if you are there early, and have a small party, you can probably find seats in the lounge or at the sushi bar (still full menu).

I think there was an overuse of bamboo in the place, the chairs were Ikea and the tables were just weirdly laid out. \n\nFirst of all, I couldn't understand the cutesy English the waitress was speaking. Each time she said something, we would pause for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, since we couldn't tell if she was asking us a question or making a statement. Then it'd be followed by, \"I'm sorry, what?\"\n\nWe ordered chilean sea bass in the black bean sauce, the crab ceviche, and some grilled beef thing. The ceviche was overwhelmingly tangy. I think it reshaped some of my fillings in my teeth. There was a lot of it though, even though the waitress told us that they were small portions. We next had the chilean sea bass which was not good at all. Again, portion was decent, but it was bland and not even hot. Finally, the meat came and although tender, it just wasn't as flavorful as I expected.\n\nFor being \"Nobu,\" I did have high expectations. But DK and I evaluated it and said that even if this was a no-name restaurant that we just walked into, we still wouldn't have thought it was good. \n\nAnd by the next morning, we were telling people that it just \"sucked.\" And I'm sticking with that. \n\nSo for those of you who speak Mandarin, you know that \"bu\" means \"don't.\"  So this restaurant's name is a forewarning of a the answer you'll give when asked, \"So was it good?\" or \"Is it worth going?\"\n\nNo. Bu."

My first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a Tuesday night), and its location in the Hard Rock Hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place I want to poke around).\n\nOur waiter, Justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get miso soup.\n\nOur first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). The servers apologized and took it away. At the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. Fortunately, it was corrected quickly.\n\nWhen our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the spicy scallops had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of spicy tuna. Again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.\n\nService got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. We were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. She seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.\n\nStill, however, Justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (I think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.\n\nRegarding the food, it was OK. The miso soup was great. The spicy tuna and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. It was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"Is this supposed to be this way and I'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" Judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. Either way, I wasn't really in love with it.\n\nFor the price I [would have] paid, I can't say that the Las Vegas Nobu is really worth it for me again. I've had much better sushi in Oakland, for much less."

This was recommended to me by my dinner companion when I went to Ame, a palate I trust. So even after many disappointing fine dining restaurants on hotel properties, I figured I would give Nobu a shot. Should of known better...\n\nStandard menu as well as two different tier of omakase available, $100 & $135 if I recall correctly. We decided to do the $135 version for all three of us, three cold course, two hot course, followed by soup, sushi, and dessert.\n\nWriting this up a week later, can't remember exactly what we had, weekend in Vegas tends to short circuit one's memory.  \nThink we started with a course of Bonito sashimi, which was fresh and nice flavor combinations. The two other cold course wasn't particularly memorable, very apparent since I can't recall much details on them. Moving onto the first hot course, which I do remember, but for the wrong reason. Some sort of white fish (Cod or Halibut), done in a sweet and sour stir-fry style with touch of spice. Sorry, but if this is what I am looking for, I'll take my money to Panda Express or any food court at a local mall.\nThe second hot course was a steak, filet is the cut...I think. Topped with a piece of seared foie gras, couple slices of egg plant, and Shitake mushroom. Probably the best course of the evening and one of the very few steak course I've enjoyed as part of tasting menu, definite a rarity.\nSoup, sushi and dessert were brought up to conclude the omakase menu, all pedestrian, nothing to write home about.\n\nNot only was the food not very interesting, the decoration of the space also seem kind of odd. What's suppose to be a fine dining restaurant, really has a very cheap feel to it. For anyone thinking about trying this place, think again, avoid if possible."

I'm glad I did because the sushi chefs were nice and accommodating. The sushi was delicious but expensive, the raw scallop was especially good. I also got the beef dish, I forgot what it was called but it came in a sizzling plate. Now this was the bomb. The miso black cod was also the bomb.\n\nThe food was cool, the sake was good, but the service wasn't all that great. The sushi chefs were great, but the waiter seemed to be serving the more baller lookin folks and ignoring us. Took us awhile just to get water and even longer to get our sake. For the price we paid , it was almost unacceptable. But since we ordered most of our food from the sushi chefs, i cant complain......"

Also, I LOVED the fried salmon skin salad. The dressing was perfectly tart and the textures all worked well together. I loved it was all leafy green so I feel like I made a somewhat healthy choice. The fried snapper, the waiters favorite, was good but after a few bites it was just overwhelmingly greasy. My mom makes an Asian version but with sweet and sour sauce rather than miso based sauce. It would only be worth ordering if you had a party of 4 or more otherwise it's too greasy for two to share. The service was great but we were rubbing elbows with a couple on a date. It was a little awkward esp when I'm with mom haha!"

The clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.  He seemed almost on the verge of addressing us as \"guys\" or calling my sweetie \"boss\".  Nothing wrong with being friendly, but lets face it this isn't a diner.  A little more dignity would have been appropriate.  Luckily, the professionalism of the runners made up for it.  \n\nYay Nobu!"

            "review": "My first visit to a Nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at Nobu Next Door in New York City.  At that point I was still evolving into the foodie that I am today, and for some reason, I absolutely loved the hot spot.  The food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  In the years that have passed since, Nobu has expanded, and I have also eaten at their Nobu 57 in Manhattan and the Vegas location.  As food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of Nobu.  This chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  While some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.  \n\nMy sushi-fanatic friend and I recently booked a trip to Vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try Nobu.  I knew that my friend was focused on it, so I went along with the recommendation, though I knew better.  We wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.\n\nOur reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  My friend ordered a glass of sangria, while I opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that I needed to exchange it for a basic glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  The wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.\n\nIn terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  A tiny mound of cool, fresh Salmon Tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty Caviar.  I am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  This particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  We also sampled one of my favorites - the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Sauce.  The succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce added a creamy kick. \n\nMy friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style House Special Roll and the Spicy Scallop Roll.  The spicy scallop one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  We actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.\n\nUnfortunately, I think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  I would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent."

In fact some are removed the instant the last bite is taken, almost in midair.  I suspect some servers are instructed to do this, so it's not their fault, but it still drives me crazy!  That being said, it didn't detract from our overall experience and many of the dishes are just unforgettable."

The bartenders were extremely friendly and had great suggestions of what drinks to order. Just the way they explained the ingredients in each drink made us want to try them all. Our favorite was the Cucumber martini (Finlandia Grapefruit Vodka, Fresh Cucumber Puree, Lychee Juice, Lemon Juice). The bartender also recommended the Spicy Acai Martini (Veev Acai Spirit, Acai, Passion Fruit Puree, Serrano Peppers). After making it for another customer he gave us some to sample and it was delicious. We will definitely be back for that drink\n\nOn to the food...\n\nYellowtail jalape\u00f1o: fresh yellowtail and just a slight but of heat from the jalape\u00f1o. Delicious.\n\nedamame: pretty standard edamame. Nothing to write home about\n\nSushi: California roll, and 3 pieces of nigiri sushi. Good fish, but not a stand out course\n\nRock shrimp: battered shrimp in a creamy spicy sauce. \n\nMiso black cod: favorite dish of the night. You really can't go wrong with black cod miso and Nobu has really nailed this dish. It was tasty and melted in your mouth. \n\nBentobox dessert: this included homemade green tea ice cream, flour less chocolate cake, and Suntory Cappucino (Chocolate crunch, coffee cream, whiskey foam and milk ice cream). The Suntory Cappucino stole the show. There were so many flavors that went together so well and weren't too sweet. I would order this again by itself\n\nOverall, it was worth what we paid because we were able to try out so many different favorite dishes they offered. They offer the full menu at the bar just in case you want to stop in without reservations. Give the Spicy Acai Martini a shot!"

But then again, so is a good vegas show - and chances are your meal here will last longer than a show and you'll remember it longer. \n\nWith that said, I had one of the best meals of my life here a few days ago. Certainly the best Japanese-style food since the last time I was at...   Nobu, many years ago.   (Most recent high-water mark of any cuisine: Beast in Portland.  But Nobu was even better than that!)\n\nYou have to remember that emotional strength is required when presented with a meal like this. Like any great art it'll reach in and pluck your heart strings when you least expect it. I nearly teared up at several dishes - the sashimi preparations are insane, the black cod lettuce wraps are amazing, scallops are incredible, and we were presented with the most savory high-end pork skewer I have ever tasted. There aren't enough superlatives in the English language to describe how this meal was; you really must go there to try it for yourself. \n\nI admit when I walked in the decor looked a little dated by current vegas standards (and has not changed in years.). The tables and chairs are pretty minimalist. It took an extra couple of minutes to be served drinks and have our orders taken. But once we engaged with our server all of my concerns evaporated. I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again and again. \n\nI also don't hesitate to award five stars to Nobu; they have earned every one of them. \n\nAnd apparently they also now have two Michelin stars.

Thanks to Chris, our waiter, and their Cucumber Martinis it was one of the more delightful, delectable dinners of recent times.\n\nI attended with a good friend of mine who has ALWAYS raved about their cucumber martinis.  Each time I would go out to eat with him at ANY restaurant he would ask for a cucumber martini in hopes of finding a place that could make one half as good as Nobu.  He kept failing at that mission.  I was made to try each time he got one and always ended up chasing the taste with a glass of Rieslings or whatever I was drinking at the time.  I am, by no means, a martini fan.  That was until I FINALLY had a cucumber martini at Nobu.  If a drink could be described as refreshing and light, this would be the one.  I had 3 that night and would've had more if I wasn't in 5\" heels and thought I'd break my ankle if my drunky self tripped.\n\nMy friend, smartly left the decision of choosing items up to our waiter, Chris, and am I thankful to Chris's knowledge of the menu and checking in with us on what was to our liking and not.  From what I remember of the evening we had:\n\nSpicy Miso Lotus Chips with Big Eye Tuna-Delicious\nBlack cod with miso in a lettuce wrap-Delightful\nYellowtail Sashimi with Jalape\u00f1o-Awesome\nCalifornia Roll-Too full to eat\nSome sort of mac & cheese dish with shrimp-Underwhelmed\n\nNot only did I enjoy myself, my food, my company, and my waiter, but it was a great place for people watching.  My friend and I spent half the time chatting about topics pertaining to us and the other half commenting on the people we observed and conversations we overheard.\n\nI will DEFININTELY come back to Nobu when in town or when in a city one is located in.

            "review": "When Nobu opened in New York City, it created a sensation.  Reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional Japanese food was widely praised.  This led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; Nobu can be found all over the globe.\n\nMeal #1: I found Las Vegas Nobu's sushi highly variable.  The overall quality was OK, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  Orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.\n\n\nMeal #2:  Since my first meal, I went to Nobu in Miami Beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  I enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the Vegas location another shot.\n\nThe restaurant looks OK, but nothing great.  It's very noisy, in keeping with the Hard Rock atmosphere.  The crowd is mostly young, but I think anyone would feel comfortable here; I did.  Service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.\n\nNow, on to the meal:\n\n    * I chose Jyunmai Daiginjyo sake.  It wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.\n    * Small Japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  Good.\n    * Trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  All served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  Good.\n    * Seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, with garlic chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  A good combination.  Very good.\n    * Uni (sea urchin) and some white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  The uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  There was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  Very good.\n    * O toro and a spring roll with Jalapeno sauce and radish.  The o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  Good to very good.\n    * Palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.\n    * Service lapse.  Up to this point, courses had been timed well.  At this point, I waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  This was a little annoying.\n    * Grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  Very good.\n    * Foie gras and Kobe beef.  A large hunk of foie gras; good flavor.  Kobe beef very good.  Overall, very good to excellent.\n    * Service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by miso soup.  They reversed the order, and apologized later.  A minor matter.\n    * Miso soup.  Better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  Very good.\n    * Sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), shima aji (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  Very good.\n    * Fruit papillote.  Like a crepe.  The raspberry seeds were very distracting.  Fair.\n    * Honey ice cream.  Very strong honey flavor.  Strange, but I liked it.  Very good.\n\nOverall, the meal was good, but not as good as Nobu in Miami, and not nearly as good as Okada.  At the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.\n\n\nMeal #3: Based on past meals, I hadn't planned to return. However, I found myself at The Hard Rock Hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. I decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. This worked out better. My selections:\n\n    * Ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). Standard but still very good.\n    * Hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar). This is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. It may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. I was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. If you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at Okada.\n    * Live shrimp. These Santa Barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so I guess that means they're fresh. They were big and rather chewy; I'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. The heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.\n    * Live octopus. I'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. Pretty good.\n\nThis was the most satisfying of my meals at Nobu. Nothing was stellar, but everything was good.\n\n\n\nNobu's strength is its new take on Japanese foods.  Its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in Las Vegas, and suspect service.  Given such high prices, I'd look elsewhere."

We both decided to get one of the chefs daily selection and one of the creations where they choose from the existing menu. My dining partner also elected to get the sake flight - a presentation of a carefully selected sake to accompany the dish they select for you. Everything was great! We both have our favorites and preferences, but not having been there before, it was nice to have someone else choose the better dishes. I expected to leave hungry. Instead, I was so full I thought I was going to die. Could have done without the final sushi dishes or dessert. This trip was meant to be a search for interesting food. I think we were pleasantly interested. Just two suggestions: go lighter on the sauces. Good fish does not need to be covered up with a heavy sauce. Secondly, change the decor. Wooden tables and cheap wooden chopsticks leave you with a sense of the mediocre not extravagant."

Personally, four stars is a little high but I really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so I'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (I don't think I've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").\n\nThe black cod with miso was the highlight. The Kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 I'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing I've ever eaten. The scallops topped with jalapeno were the third great dish. The sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.\n\nThe ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for Vegas. It looks the way a Japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. And the service, though efficient, was humorless. Any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based desserts off the menu is not winning any points with me.\n\nStill, the price minus the Kobe was totally reasonable, especially for Vegas. And the Matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward adding up to a pretty good meal."

We pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.\n\nFirst course- Spicy Tuna and I think Dragon Roll- it was good, but come on I can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!\n\nSecond course- Tempura Rock Shrimp with Spicy Aioli and Tempura Vegetables with Soy Glaze.  Very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. \n\nThird Course- Yellowtail with Jalepeno and Citrus Ponzu- AMAZING!  So damn good I would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  Pepper Seared Rare Ahi with Chili Vinegar Sauce- Again give me a plate of this and I would die a happy man.\n\nFourth Course- Miso Marinated Cod- This is by far the best seafood dish I have ever tried.  The fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  Simply heaven. \n\nFifth Course- Trio of Sorbets\n\nI must say the food was great minus the first course!  Spicy Tuna and Dragon Roll at a high end Japanese Restaurant?  I don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people I think that Spicy Tuna is not needed!"

Second we had the other signature dish - black cod w miso.  The fish is cooked with a lovely butter texture - the sauce is rather sweet (the miso I presume) - reasonably substantial portion.  We finished with the chef's sushi plate ($75!!) which was a good variety of sushi - some had sweet or savory sauces but it was primarily just fish w wasabi on rice (the rice is rather sweet compared to other places).  The grand total for this was $150 before tip and we drank tap water.  Alcohol was ridiculously expensive so we didn't order anything to drink.  I would definitely go again but probably be a bit more adventurous w the menu choices.  There is also an option for 150/person where the chef just creates a menu for you - looks wonderful if you want to spend that much.  In sum excellent (but extremely expensive) sushi.  The fish is extremely fresh - a nice surprise in the desert."

I'd been wanting to try out one of the LA locations for a while, so this seemed like a win-win. Overall, the experience was pretty great. The service was friendly and very attentive (almost too attentive... my ice tea cup was never empty. i don't think they even let it get half empty...)\n\nThe meal started with edamame which wasn't anything special. Standard at any Japanese place you'd go to. The first course was the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. This was so good!! I'm normally not a jalepeno fan, but it had just the right amount of kick to it. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night.\n\nNext up was the Rock Shrimp Tempura. This was alright. I liked the sauce with the lettuce/salad below, but it was too heavy for the shrimp... My friend and I agreed that it just left us craving honey walnut shrimp from Panda Express. \n\nThird entree up was the Black Cod Miso. This was also an outstanding dish, like the yellowtail. The fish was cooked perfectly and the entire dish was both presented well and tasted great. \n\nThe fourth entree (and the reason for docking one star) was California Roll and assorted Nigiri. Maybe it's just because I live in LA and I'm spoiled by great sushi, but I wasn't impressed. The fish was fresh enough, but definitely not up to par to say, Sugarfish. And at the heart of it all, Nobu is a Japanese restaurant, so I expected their sushi to be on par with their fusion dishes. Sadly, not the case.\n\nThe meal ended with the Bento Box dessert, which had flour-less chocolate cake, green tea ice cream and some cappuccino thing. I'm not a huge dessert person but it was ok. I've never disliked any green tea ice cream I've had and the cappuccino thing was unique. \n\nOverall, it was a great meal and good experience. Without a doubt, it was worth the price of the Groupon. Not sure about full price though. I think only the Yellowtail sashimi and black cod miso would be worth it."

It's super Americanized Japanese food that has some modern cooking elements added to it, but nothing that elevates the food enough for the price. We went on a Travelzoo special deal, $95 for 7 courses for two people. If we had to spend the normal price, I would've been angry for sure. At least I get to cross this off of my restaurant bucket list. \n\nThe courses...\n- Edamame: regular cold edamame with chunky kosher salt. Nothing special! I make yuzu citrus salt edamame that would give this place a run for it's money. \n- Salmon carpaccio and vegetable spring rolls: the salmon is covered in some mustard sauce that takes away from the salmon taste, and frankly, the salmon quality is not that great. It's the same quality as any run of the mill sushi joint that serves American rolls in OC. The vegetable spring roll in the center was kinda nice for the freshness and crunchy aspects. \n- Sushi course: comes with a caterpillar roll and 3 fish types of sushi. C'MON!!! A CATERPILLAR ROLL? You can't even tell it's a caterpillar roll because the eel taste is too absent. Tastes like a rice roll covered in eel sauce. The quality of the fish for the Nigiris was again not as fresh as I would expect for this caliber of a restaurant. I don't know who picks the fish or the fish monger, but they need to do better. I forget the 3 types of fish now, but one did come with a perilla leaf nestled between the rice and fish. I liked that element added, the fish itself was covered in a citrus and salt, which is my favorite flavor profile for sushi. The others were covered in a sweet soy or something. I can't remember very well, because it was all very unmemorable. \n- Miso black cod: the quality of the fish is spectacular in some parts and super dried in others. This fish dish is good, but I would say a bit too overly sweet. This was my fav dish of all the courses, but it's not enough to make me wanna come back ever. This dish wasn't executed 100% perfectly. \n- Ribeye course: the meat is cooked to a super tender texture since it's braised for a while, but the sauce it's braised in is again sweet. There was a weird lemongrass taste somewhere in the dish that didn't belong. The heart of palm done two ways - pureed and fried - both did nothing for me. The fried ones tasted just like oil and no distinct flavor. The puree was mush and added no value to the dish either. I guess it's a rice substitute, but it's a poor sub for it. \n- Mushroom soup: tastes like mushroom water with smoke added. The mushrooms in it are the stem of king oyster mushroom, maitake mushroom which is also called hen-of-the-wood, and one shiitake. I recognize all the mushrooms immediately since I cook with all these myself often. I'm not sure how they get the smoke taste, I'm guessing they cold smoke the mushrooms before adding it to simmering water. Could use salt or dashi or something else to take it to the next level. \n- Dessert: 3 fried bland balls. The black sesame ice cream is good though! \n\nDon't waste your time, money, or stomach space for this place. Would've put one star except for the service that night was really nice. I think Nobu needs to let me cook him or take him around for some real Japanese dishes with soul."

Also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. Those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. We ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. The following are dishes I had sampled.\n\nSpicy Miso Lotus Chips with Tuna & Scallop - The chips were crispy and not oily. The tuna was ok. The scallops were not. Something was off.\n\nShishito Peppers - I loved these peppers. They are full of flavor yet not spicy. I could snack on them all day. \n\nMushroom Soup - This tasted meaty and delicious.\n\nToro (Blue Fin) and Scallion Sushi Roll - I did not like this at all. The texture of the fish seemed off to me.\n\nSea Urchin Nigiri - The texture and flavor was ok.\n\nChicken Kushiyaki (Teriyaki & Anticucho) - Ok. A bit dry and overcooked. \n\nTeriyaki Tenderloin of Beef - Good."

I just kept comparing it to my favorite, which is kind of unfair. However, this time was different...very memorable in a good way. \n\nMy server Gordon and his waitstaff team's service was amazing! I had the locals tasting menu ($75) and it was worth every penny. Every dish was cordially described in just the right amount of detail before being served. All questions were answered in a friendly manner. The atmosphere was very nice and classy as well. Beautiful decor. \n\n-Kobe Beef Taco (as an appetizer, separate from tasting menu)...best taco ever! beef was soft and moist\n\n-Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno (best sashimi i've ever had by far! so soft and fresh. price tag aside, i could go for 10 of these plates! though that might be too much of a good thing)\n-Tuna Sashimi Salad (love it. best tuna ever) \n-Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy (best shrimp ever...you're getting the point! i didnt know shrimp could taste this good) \n-Black Cod Miso (this and the yellowtail sashimi were my favorite dishes...high praise for these 2 seems to be the trend based off of many reviews. definitely no disagreement here. best fish ever! if you are ordering one item, i highly recommend it) \n-Assorted Sushi and Miso Soup (basics but pretty good. large scallops were added to the soup. unique taste and interesting twist compared to standard miso soup. delicious!) \n-Dessert (strawberry, vanilla, green tea mochi ice cream)...all were great. not really a complaint, but a variety of desserts is preferred. im sure they would be amazing like everything else as well.\n\nThank you Nobu, for one of the best dining experiences ever. I will definitely be back!"

Awesome team. \n\nNow, food. Personally, skip the taco apps, nothing special to note there. The rock shrimp had a bit too much sauce for even that type of dish. DO go for the Chilean Sea Bass with dry miso. It's perfectly cooked in a buttery-citrusy sauce bed; the dry miso on top adds texture and will make your mouth water. A dish that is both simple yet complex on its own. Also, the uni shooter was absolutely delish, with the right balance of sauce and meat. I had a spicy acai cocktail which was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while!! Yum. I was too tired to remember what else we had. Wish we came earlier to try the rest of the menu."

The server told us she would bring us several dishes, but not the full tasting menu.  Well, several courses, 4 beers and 2 bottles of wine later, I guess we had spent enough money to keep the table since it was waaaayyyyy past our allotted hour. \n\nThe food was pretty incredible - kumamoto oysters with caviar, wonderful fresh sashimi, tempura, rock shrimp with some type of amazing sauce.  I think my favorite dish was also the most pretentious - duck that was cooked over hot river stones and then finished off at the table with a splash of courvoseour that was then set aflame!\n\n$750 for four and we were still hungry enough to stop off int he VIP reception area of the Bellagio on the way back and polish off the desserts they had laid out."

Both times they were extremely accomodating and knowledgable.\n\nWe had tofu sashimi, hearts of palm salad, a mushroom rice dish, various rolls, and a flourless chocolate cake we will never forget.\n\nThe ambiance reminds me of an urban outfitter and I mean that in a great way.\n\nThe service is world-class.

And since I had Nobu while I was in Hong Kong(which by the way, was amazing like always) - I thought I'd skip the visit to Nobu in Las Vegas and save some money. \n\nBut my boyfriend was very sweet and surprised me with a RSVP to Nobu the night we arrived, so I dragged myself out of bed, dressed up and headed up Nobu. \n\nI've been to Vegas twice before, many years ago, but never had the chance to try Nobu. It was about a $15 cab ride from Mandalay Bay to Hard Rock, and when we arrived - we found the restaurant well hidden in the back of the entrance. The ambiance was nice, but nothing compared to the decor in Nobu Tokyo or Hong Kong. Venue was small in comparison as well. \n\nThe food was great, check out pictures of the sushi/appetizers from that night. \n\nIf you are new to Nobu, here are a few recommendations from that night.\nOtoro Nigiri - $38\nSea Urchin - $15\nBarracuda - $40\nMonkfish Liver(Ankimo) - $30\nSquid Pasta - $20\n\nand pair them with the Nobu beer! By the way, Nobu beer costs $15 each in San Diego, but costs only $8 in Las Vegas - don't know why, maybe the higher demand for beer allows them to lower their price?\n\nAll and all, Nobu Las Vegas was great....but...\n\nI wish I didn't have to say this, especially since I have such a bias for Nobu - but the staff did not treat us the way a $250 bill deserves. It was probably due to the fact that we were a young couple, and didn't look like we had hundred dollar bills in hand to \"rain\" on the waiters. But either they were blind, or the fact that I was carrying an exclusive limited edition Louis Vuitton bag from Japan meant nothing to them. \n\nWaiter made no effort to create a conversation, rushed us from start to end, took five years to refill my hot green tea, yet five seconds to take the American Express off my boyfriend's hand. The waiter also talked to me as if I had never heard of Nobu in my entire life, he even questioned how I had known about the Nobu beer(since I ordered it without advertisement). At that moment I wanted to whip out the photo I took with Chef Nobu himself in Tokyo Nobu on my phone, but I thought, even if I did that, what does it proof besides the fact that I am dying for everyone to know that I met Chef Nobu, and that the waiter is an asshole? \n\nMaybe I was being a little harsh, but I have certain expectations from a restaurant who plans to charge me $250 minimum for dinner. Since those expectations weren't met, I am ranting on Yelp. \n\nIf you want better service, try Nobu Tokyo or Hong Kong."

We looked inside the newest entry into the highly competitive arena that is your mother's meatloaf and a chocolate shake for $35, and it reminded me of my elementary school cafeteria.  We were looking over the menu outside the door, which of course was a joke and not the least bit original, at which point the following conversation occurred:\n\nMe:  Jesus what a joke.\nWife:  Yeah, it looks pretty lame.\nMe:  I mean, really.  What a stupid ass restaurant.\nWife:  Yeah...  Well, Jon Bon Jovi likes it.\nMe:  Yeah, well, Jon Bon Jovi is an asshole.\nWife:  (now in a hushed tone):  I mean, he just walked out the door and right by us....\nMe:  Oh shit.\n \nFortunately, it would seem that he was out of earshot by that point.  More fortunately, it appears he left Simon in favor of heading over to Nobu.  Good call, that.\n \nWe did Nobu twice during our stay.  It was fantastic.  We did mostly just sushi, which was uniformly superior.  However, it is also supremely expensive, and it does have some of the trappings of a touristy restaurant as opposed to a true sushi bar; most notably the fact that it is not necessarily understood that an \"order\" of  \"sushi\" means two pieces.  This can be disconcerting when you get the bill and discover that the toro, which is unbelievably and deliciously oily to the point that it seems suspended between solid and liquid states, cost you $15 PER PIECE.  Not per order, PER PIECE.  \n\nI have NEVER had an order of sushi that expensive, and in my mind, no sushi is worth that price.  And I have been to the now relocated-to-New-York Ginza Sushi-Ko in Beverly Hills (afka the most expensive restaurant in LA).  There, their equally top-notch toro was a mere $15 per ORDER, a la carte.\n\nIn our second visit, we wised up and didn't order the especially pricey items and still had a terrific experience.  I have no complaints about the place, other than the price.  The chefs were very attentive, accommodating, and friendly.  The waitresses were a little hard to flag down at time, however.\n\nNobu LV is at least as good as its counterpart in New York, as well as Matsuhisa in LA, and I believe better than Nobu Malibu, all of which I highly recommend.  I'd give it 5 stars if the service were a little better and the prices more reasonable."

This place ranks second to French Laundry on my list of favorites. \n\nFirst- if you are a first time visitor there, I would recommend just ordering off of the menu. I am sure the Omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the Omakase. \n\nSecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. It's okay- but the other items are so much better. We saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \n\nThird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. Just a FYI if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. I also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. I would pass on these- IMO the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \n\nWe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. Pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. The sheshito peppers were really good. They taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. My husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. My only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \n\nSo we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \n\n1. Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - definitely get this- it was awesome! \n\n2. The blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \n\n3. Chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \n\n4. Kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \n\n5. Lobster Ceviche- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \n\n6. Red snapper with dry miso - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \n\n7. Then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (CA rolls and Ama Ebi)- all which were fine. \n\n8. We ordered the bento box dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \n\nOverall- the meal was great. The black miso cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. The Chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \n\nWe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. The whole meal with tip was just over $300. I highly recommend this place. It was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of Vegas that was great."

For around $150-300 (not including bar tab) per person you get family style eating of fresh Japanese food. There are approximately 7 courses brought out, one at a time, a delicious and fresh array.  The raw ahi with a dash of caviar, lettuce wraps, steak on the mini hibachi, etc., was fun to see what would arrive next. The service was impeccable, the place is clean (although I don't like that you have to exit the restaurant to use the restroom) and food quality excellent.  Personally, Japanese is not my favorite and $150/200 pp for me, is steep if I am not loving the food. If you enjoy fresh Japanese, then this place may be for you."

She looked around (the restaurant was about 10% filled) and hesitated, then said something along the lines of \"I suppose we can seat you anyway\"\n\nWaiter: talked out of his ass. SERIOUSLY. This guy had no idea what he was saying!!! He tried to sound extremely educated in food once I told him I was a huge fan of Nobu and that I had all his cookbooks and loved them all. When describing the lobster risotto, he said \"and the way the chef prepares the risotto with the wakame and the seaweed....\" HI. wakame IS seaweed. \"the mirugai and the giant clam we call geoduck...\" HI. can you be any more redundant? Don't try to play fancy foreign word games with me like I have no clue what you're saying. I flashed my best smile everytime he came to word vomit. He had good intentions, but it was borderline offensive that he tried to add in japanese words as if we didn't know what they meant.\n\nPROs: the staff is very attentive, very quick to remove finished plates so that the next course can be served. We never had to ask for a refill of water because of how attentive the wait staff was. The food was good, albiet pretentious... (I would never ever pay $30 for five paper-thin slices of hamachi with little slivers of jalapeno and overly acidic ponzu again), The menu was innovative, modern, and divided into clear categories to help you order a little bit of every category. The wait staff is very helpful with describing dishes, recommending dishes, and answering questions you have about the menu.\n\nCONs: again, extremely frou frou Japnese food. The price is not reflective of the quality of food. $40 for a tiny amount of risotto served in a fancy big plate that looks like a bowl... PLEASE. The black cod was not fresh-- it seemed like the miso was attemting to cover up the slightly old taste of the black cod... The ceviche hurt my masseters. I probably made the ugliest little puckerface from the acid in the ceviche $35 tiny bowl of ceviche. I'm fine with paying good money for good food, but honestly, Nobu was a let down. If it's tiny portions, at least make them SPECTACULAR tiny portions. Spectacular it was not.\n\nWe left hungry, and went for a real dinner afterwards. Sorry, Nobu. Maybe we'll try another one of your restaurants, but definitely not Las Vegas."

Based off their Chilean Sea Bass and Black Cod dishes, I'm quite impressed and have confidence that any of their dishes would be a good pick. These dishes were well prepared and were not drenched in sauce. Their raw fish tastes as if it's fresh from the ocean; definitely close to what you can get in Japan.

The Rock Shrimp are just amazing with a creamy sauce and again with a perfect bite at the finish. Our server offered a variation of my favorite black miso cod- small portions served on butter lettuce cups that rocked so much I ordered a second. \n\nFor our special adventure we opted for the Hearts of Palm pasta- again a kick and for me interesting but not a fav yet Clarence loved it! Last and should have been first was their Miso soup- probably the best anywhere , served piping hot and I enjoy it as a finish. \n\nThe Wagyu Beef was so tempting but I passed. It is hard for me to order a dish equivalent to two new pairs of shoes... Honestly we have never been disappointed in a Nobu splurge. I was pretty full before the table next to us ordered it and caused me to have food envy but there is always next time. \n\nAaron was a super knowledgable and very attentive.

I went with a group of colleagues and rather than order off the menu, we had the waiter pick some dishes and have them bring them out and it was fantastic.  We had a variety of fish dishes, some sliced super thin with great seasonings, my favorite was one that had a great ginger finish to it.  If you get the chance to let the waiters pick a variety of dishes for you, I highly recommend it."

Its a little overpriced for what it is, they need to do more FOOD, I left hungry.  That shouldnt happen.  Service 98 out of 100.  Food 95 out of 100  Value 80 out of 100.   I think it was a little overpriced, but the quality was totally there!   I would definitely go again, and I think I would love it again, but it let me down just a little, after hearing all the hype.   I could go here once , or go to sushi mon 4 times, all I can eat, you know my choice on that one if I want sushi 4 times!   \n\nAfter the sticker shock, which I didnt pay so I dont care what it costs, the food was insanely good.  We had the saki, beers, and a feast of sashimi, shrimp, miso soup, and rolls.   My favorite was the lettuce wrapped black cod, oh my god, this was the BEST FISH bite I have ever had.  It melted in your mouth like butter from the fat and the protein - I am not sure if it was oil pan fried, or what, it was hot, but not too hot, but it had a little sizzle on it, and the glazed oil on it just added to the silky flavor.  I would go back there just for that!   The desert was a rhubarb molten love with ice cream over it, talk about yummy!   Tasted like strawberries to me, but it was perfect, I would have taken one more scoop of Icecream, next time I will ask.   I am sure they would accommodate.     5 star food at 5 star prices.    \n\nDecor was a little drab to me, I dont know what it was, it was classy, but too dark, the bamboo was nice, but I think they could use some LIVE FISH Tank in the place, maybe I missed something, the walkway in was nice, but the dining room was a little drab for me.  I think a splash of color would have been nice.   Anyway, I am nitpicking now and thats not fair to them.    Quality stuff, Incredible food, great dining room, great location at Hard Rock.  Highly Recommended.  Please bring your wallet, or someone elses, you will need it!     Also, be prepared for a late night snack later meal after, unless you are on a diet.    4.5 Star Overall, I likey!"

I could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  Thankfully being with the group I was with that wasn't allowed to happen and I enjoyed several other items from the menu.\n\nFor myself I ordered the Chilean sea bass with a dry miso rub, the lobster ceviche, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  The sea bass had a very mild flavor although the dry miso was tasty.  I think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  The lobster ceviche was great and I could have had a couple more but I held off so I could enjoy my entire meal.  The uni was good, although I don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  I'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  At least I hope so.  The surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. It was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  With a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  I really should have gotten at least one more order.\n\nI was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  All were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time I eat at Nobu.\n\nFor dessert I had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  The popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the Yelp events I've been to."

It's me, my wife, and our two girls.  These are girls whose preferred snack is sushi.  These are kids who grew up eating at places like Chez Panisse, Lalime's -- kids who the people at the Cheese Board know not only by sight but are on a first-name basis with.\n\nThese are Berkeley kids.  We go to Nobu.\n\nWe have reservations for a 9:00 show, so we make 6:00 pm dnner reservations.  If they had their way, they would have had us out of there by 6:15!\n\nThere were actually six of us for dinner, lined up with dozens of other people waiting for the front door to be unlocked promptly at 6:00.  We inched inside as part of the reservation conga, only to be shunted aside while they seated others who were in line behind us.  What?  Our table not ready?  THE PLACE WAS EMPTY UNTIL THEY LET US IN!  It's not like they had to wait for someone to leave before they could seat us.\n\nWe listened to the waiter's suggestions in terms of how he thought (the restaurant thought?) we should proceed through the menu.  The three adults order sake; the three kids ordered whatever it was that they ordered; and we all ordered food.\n\nO.K., I do NOT believe that a place with the reputation of Nobu makes their sushi in advance.  I DO believe their sushi is made-to-order.  Honest, I do.  But the sushi, the soup, the soba, the hot plates -- it all came at warp speed, and plates were whisked away before I finished swallowing the last bite!  Instead of a relaxed meal where we could talk, drink, and savor some extraordinary dishes, we were given our check (not cheap) and practically rushed out the door!\n\nI'm had more relaxing meals at In-n-Out!

Economy or Vegas?  \n\nBoyfriend is a Nobu-phile (who isn't, once they've been?) and so insisted that we order the Yellowtail with Jalapeno and the kobe on hot rocks, but then gave our server latitude to bring us a few other raw dishes.  Every single thing I put in my mouth was outstanding.\nAs noted by the legions of yelpers, the Yellowtail with Jalapeno blows you away--big, bright, fresh flavors that highlight, not mask, the fish.  \nNext out was snapper with breadcrumbs.  Similar to the yellowtail in that it featured fresh fish adorned simply with bold, savory flavors, but with a totally different flavor profile.\nThe third, and final, cold dish was that day's special: toro served with arugula, a truffle oil-infused dressing and topped with fresh truffle shavings.  I was a bit nervous about this dish, having seen it on the menu, because I love truffles in theory but often find them cloyingly rich and heavy, with a sort of artificial after taste.  This dish induced giggles, it was so good (see Mastro's review for further discussion).  It also induced an epiphany: I dislike truffle oil for the exact reasons enumerated above but I LOVE fresh truffles.  They have all of the best parts of truffle oil (that intense earthy umami flavor) but without any of the fake, sickeningly denseness.  I know, I know: TOTAL white people problem.  \n\nFinally, it was on to the kobe beef on hot rocks.  Fun, interactive and tasty as hell.  Lots of sauces and spices to choose from, but our favorite was just sea salt and the Japanese seven spice.  Our waiter (excellent service, incidentally) brought us a 6 oz portion which we finished but couldn't have eaten any more of.  At $27/oz, that's a pricey little entree but definitely a splurge-worthy item if you're looking/able to splurge.\n\nWe rounded things out with cocktails in lieu of wine and I definitely appreciated the relative speed with which the meal moved as we had a comedy show to get to that evening.  I left feeling sated, not stuffed, and already thinking about when I could back to Nobu for more."

It's a 5 course meal where they start you off with appetizers, entrees , then dessert. The appetizers given to us (Edemame and peppers) were alright. Nothing special, as you can get them from any restaurant or store. However, what really impressed me greatly at Nobu was the Yellow Fin Tuna Sashimi! I love sashimi, and eat it all the time. However, after eating this, it simply couldn't compare to any sashimi I've had anywheres. The servers were kind enough to recommend us that we don't use Ginger and Wasabi, for this could ruin the taste that the chef wanted in the first palace. I was glad I didn't use ginger/wasabi for this sashimi, since it was simply so tasteful and great! Afterwards, they served us Black Cod and rock shrimp which were great, but nothing crazy. I was sort of disappointed in the last entree they served us, a plate of sushi. It was simply slices of Tuna and Salmon on balls of rice. Nothing special. They also served spicy tuna roll and California roll on the entree. These sushis were simple, nothing great or special. It seemed that Nobu really lacked in that dish. It was just.. Plain. Couldn't Nobu do better than serve a dish that any sushi restaurant could make? \n\nTo conclude, service was amazing ! Great and honest staff. The feel and ambience was good and quiet. The lighting was good as well. \n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant, especially the yellow fin tuna sashimi!\n\nFood 4/5\nCleanliness 5/5\nService 5/5"

This was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar.\nNote: Masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  You finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.\n\nFood:\nMonkfish Liver - honestly, not my thing.  I tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  It had caviar on top which I ate.  But my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  He enjoyed having the dish to himself.\nTiradito, Nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  One of my faves but not for hubby\nWhite fish New Style Sashimi - sashimi doused with soy sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. Also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby. \nSweet Shrimp New Style Sashimi - even better than the above.  YUM.  Hubby let me have most of this one and for that, I'm forever grateful.\nUni Tempura - this was the one thing I wanted to try the most.  The shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and I greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  More for me!  The accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious.\nMiso Black Cod - I didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The serving size was reasonable.  Four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  Very enjoyable.\nScallops with Wasabi Pepper Sauce - Again, a pretty good-sized serving. The sauce was phenomenal although I do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  I'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.  \n\nDessert:\nCaramel Chocolate Mouse - I thought this sounded rather ordinary until I looked at the ingredient list.  Globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped with shiso citrus granite, topped with caramel \"caviar\"; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy Japanese rice.  BEST dish we had all night.  Loved it.  I could have had 3 more.\n\nService was great with several lapses here and there.  The busboys were impeccable.  Our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.\n\nThe quality of the food was excellent and did not disappoint.  I'm no stranger to paying several bills for dinner but for whatever reason, I did feel that food was somewhat overpriced here.  Or maybe for what we paid, I thought the food should have been 5-star."

They constantly make sure everything is clean, and ready, glasses filled, and your needs are met. The bill for 6 of us was $270 before tip, so this is costly, but not too over-priced. It is definitely an upper echelon restaurant. The Las Vegas venue is situated in the middle of the Hard Rock Hotel and is therefore several decibels too high. If you eat there frequently you are going to lose your hearing. That is why I give it 4 stars. I can imagine this restaurant outside of the Hard Rock Hotel will be more pleasant.

My wife and I aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...I understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, IMO.\n\nWe went on a Sunday night at 7:30p. We were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. My wife had the Passion Mojito, and I stuck with a Sapporo because I'm not a huge fan of sake. The drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the Omakase.\n\nThere are two basic \"levels\" of Omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. The lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". We both opted for the latter. I was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so I likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes. \n\n- Kumamoto Oyster, on the half-shell, with Nobu Salsa\n- Sweet Shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head)\n- Some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, I'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings)\nAll three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, I think, ponzu sauce. The oyster was pretty large, such that I didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. The sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what I'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than I would expect, but still very good.\n\n- Kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom \nKampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. The kelp and mushroom, I think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later. \n\n- New-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side\nThey have a really good sauce for the uni, because I don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) The unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.\n\n- Toro salad with vegetable spring roll\nI wasn't crazy about the spring roll...I thought it was bland. The toro salad, however, was very good.\n\n- Green tea & Ume sorbet\nI guess this was a palate cleanser? I wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. After the server brought it out, I told my wife, \"Thank you for dining at Nobu, please come back soon.\" Anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.\n\n- Broiled snapper over risotto with snow crab meat, topped with a white truffle chip \nThe hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. The risotto was OK, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.\n\n- Small, sliced, grilled \"Kobe\" beef tenderloin with Okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled Japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled foie gras.\nI'm going to commit heresy in a bit...I put Kobe in quotes, because I hear a bunch of stories about whether or not Kobe is Kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. Great dish. I don't really like eggplant, but this was OK, so they did something right. I'd never had foie gras before, and, well, meh? There, I said it.\n\n- Miso soup with clam\nAnother break, like the sorbet. It wasn't bad or anything, but I was getting kinda full, so I almost skipped it. (almost).\n\n- Nigiri sampler: Oh Toro, pink snapper, sardine, snow crab, jumbo clam\nThe clam was fresh and crunchy, but the snow crab was pretty ordinary. This was only the second time I've had sardine nigiri. I like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, I think it's just too oily? I couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. My wife told me the Oh Toro was awful and that I should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. I love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) Try the Oh Toro.\n\n- Blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries.\nFull. I almost had to pass on dessert (almost). Again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well. \n\nThe service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. Our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.\n\nIf you're a fan of this type of Japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in Vegas, so live a little!"

            "review": "This is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nThe Skinny: fusion Peruvian Japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the Groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. So you can imagine what I have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nSo here's the deal. We spotted the Nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nWe went and were seated prompty. Our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. We ended up getting in addition to the prix fixe an order of their vegetable tempura to round out the menu. The specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so I passed on those.\n\nStarting with some simple edamame with Maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\nCourse 1) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. Although I have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. My only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\nCourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. I was despondent when I realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\nCourse 3) rock shrimp tempura: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. I think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. Flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\nCourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! Overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. I have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\nCourse 5) vegetable tempura (added to the Groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. The batter was slightly spongier than what I like. I think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could add as much/little we wanted.\n\nCourse 6) normally this would be mochi ice cream except it was my birthday so I got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea ice cream. All of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nPerhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. However time has made his dishes appear quite dated. The signature dishes of rock shrimp tempura/yellowtail jalape\u00f1o sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. Given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, I cannot recommend this place given the Groupon price let alone full price. Although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review."

So use your imagination..\n\ncourse 1 - a bonito sashimi.\ncourse 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes.\ncourse 3 - toro sashimi with ponzu ginger sauce and jalapeno sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap.\ncourse 4 - seared scallops on a bed of sea beans.\ncourse 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried foie gras.\ncourse 6 - sushi set (nigiri) with lobster broth and lobster chunks.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (red snapper) and tamago.\ncourse 7 - an array of sweets including mochi ice cream, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.\n\n..\n\nall in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.  \n\ni was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like LA, SF, NY, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.\n\ni truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am TOTALLY infatuated with bone marrow.\n\n..\n\ni've said too much.  \n\ni am off to eat.\n\nEDIT:\n\ni don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.\n\n*shrugs*"

Got Omakase, but not just Omakase....\n\nDebated going here since we're vegans... thought I MIGHT have fish for the first time in over 4 years then decided against it and canceled our reservations. But then the night we stayed IN the Hard Rock Hotel and walked by the joint?.... well.... here's how it went down:\n\nWe stopped to just check out the menu to see what veg options were even available. The hostess and host were wondering what we were contemplating and why... We told them that we were veg and everyone at the hostess station said 'No Problem!! Come in, vegetarians here all the time!!'... but then we followed that up with 'Well, we're actually vegans.....' to which one waiter said 'Let me check with the chef, I'll be right back.' \n\nApparently the kitchen 'wanted the challenge'.... so in we went!\n\nSat down and decided to order the omakase meal. Usually this consists of six plates plus dessert but we actually got EIGHT and TWO desserts (one each, two different desserts)... Can I say AMAZING?! The food that the kitchen came up with was AMAZING. We actually were stuffed by the time the sixth course of food came around (and we thought last!) but TWO more came. By the time dessert was served we didn't think we could fit anymore into our stomachs. But we \"managed\" :)\n\nFood, service, everything was impeccable. Def would highly recommend a visit.

            "review": "When I criticized Morimoto Napa for being like a \"Vegas restaurant,\" I now realize I was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  Chef Nobu has a signature, Peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.\n\nUni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money ladder.\n\nThe tataki plates of Kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  They're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.\n\nKing crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.\n\nThe same goes for the lobster salad; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the lobster was lost.  But the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.\n\nThe black cod with miso is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  Miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  That's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  And I *love* miso.\n\nMaki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  That's a first for me.  I'm not sure I get the logic behind it.  The special house rolls e.g. with jalape\u00f1o are tasty enough, but generally the additional flavors don't complement the fish very well.\n\nThe sushi itself is perfectly made.  The knife work and rice preparation and rolling are impeccable.\n\nNobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  It's also to be expected from Las Vegas.  \n\nI'd certainly recommend Nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  I don't think I'd recommend much beyond that.  Japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  Nor does it need an additional side of ponzu sauce."

My favorite dishes here were the chilean sea bass over buttered lettuce, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. A table next to us ordered rock shrimp tempura in a spicy sauce, so being the food envious kind of guy I am, I ordered one for our table...unfortunately it was the worst dish we've had here as the sauce used was too overbearing and salty. it was a creamy spicy red sauce similar to a dynamite sauce used in other sushi joints. For some reason, it just didn't go well with the texture of the rock shrimp tempura. Other than that, Nobu was a great experience and would definitely come back here again for sure."

Expensive without the Groupon deal for us, mere mortals who went to Vegas on a budget. They allow up to 3 Groupons per table which other restaurants will not do. Bill for the 5-course tasting menu for 5 women with 3 Groupons and 1 bottle of rose came to $350. Thank you, Nobu, you made my 50th birthday memorable."

Nobu on the strip is incredible. I had one of the best dining experiences here of my life. Their service was amazing. Our waiter, Andrew (5 stars+!!), took our menus away from us in the early going. His confidence that he could order better than us was not misplaced. What followed as an incredible sampling from across the menu. We were exposed to a variety of flavors and types of sushi. It seemed that right after we finished a dish, and had a moment or two to talk it over, another roll appeared. I can't describe how wonderful and timely the service was. Maybe this is the best way - The next night we literally cut a meal at another sushi place short halfway through and jumped a cab back to Nobu. We were glad we did. Thank you Nobu, and thank you Andrew! Cheers."

Loved it all as well as the miso soup.  The sushi was fresh and melts in your mouth.  I also liked how the soft shell crab roll was prepared with tobiko, avocado and a thin layer of daikon wrapping the outside of the roll.  The only thing I didn't like was the kelp salad (weird crunchy texture and sour flavor), but they let me exchange it for the field greens salad instead (just ok).  The restaurant is gorgeous on the inside, and the service was excellent.  It definitely satisfied my sushi craving, but at $80 it was a bit steep."

We had the tasting menu and some sushi.  The Yellowtail with Jalapeno, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. The Black Cod with Miso and the Beef Tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  Everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  The sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  It's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  Then again, it's hard to mess up miso soup and theirs was the worst I've ever had (way too salty).  Service was good.  \n\nOur bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  So if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, Nobu is the place to go.  Or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  That's when you go to Nobu.  \n\nThere are many reasons to go to Nobu, but edible food is not among them.  If you want good food, there are some great French options in the area, such as Le Cirque."

Unfortunately I am not fond of the hotel that it's located in... which is barely a step up from a Hooters-type ambiance with the class-less tatted out clientele and their hoochie mama's attached to their hips.  Well back in the day Hard Rock was the place to go to... but that was years ago.  So the fact that one has to step foot into the Hard Rock Casino to get into the entrance of this restaurant... should really get a minus star for not strategically relocating this at a more ritzy hotel casino like Bellagio or Cosmopolitan.   \n\nWe started off with cocktails... Lychee martini and a greyhound... can't go wrong there.  As for the app...started off with the sea salted warm edemame.  I was so hungry, I practically ate all the soy beans.  I ordered the yummy Kelp salad and he ordered Hamachi sashimi with Jalepeno... so perfectly fresh with Ponzu sauce or Miso... so good!  He ordered the Shrimp with spicy garlic was sinfully delicious... (fried so not a healthy choice).  And I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with dried miso... my all time favorite, which did not disappoint!  Salmon, Hamachi and Unagi sushi... small but still so good.  AND we ended with yet another cocktail :-) and the Bento Box.... flourless chocholate cake with white chocolate sauce and green tea ice cream... OMG!  Amazing dinner with outstanding service.  Yes Nobu is expensive but I was fortunate that he was so generous... so not really sure what our bill was... but so worth every bite."

I've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but I wouldn't know, because Nobu offers up so many unique South-American influenced Japanese dishes that I only order from their special items.  I recommend you do the same; you didn't come to Vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?\r\n\r\nThe star of the menu is the Broiled Black Cod with Miso.  When you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  Also great are Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, New Style Sashimi, and Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing.  \r\n\r\nMy rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't Todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, I could go more often to feast on the delicious food."

I asked both places to take my number down in case of cancellations, and Nobu did- for 8:30. Yes, it was ultra modern, and a bit too dimly lit, and we WERE sitting behind an obnoxiously loud newlewed couple (she was still in her white wedding dress, spilling drinks, and talking loudly to her neighbors!) there were no restrooms (had to leave the restaurant) but all in all- this was a five star meal (in blinging bright Vegas styled neon lights-flashing!!) if there ever was one.

On and on... the dishes came. Beautiful and perfect, each shining in it's own vibrant manner, beautifully crafted and thought-provoking. Perfectly portioned... perfectly perfect.  The yellowtail with a slim sliver of jalepeno was awesome- my bf's pick of the night. The chilean sea bass divine. The trout with that sweet citrus.. the hamachi w/garganzola and balsamic- so unreal.

Since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the Chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  We both received 9 courses with sake pairing. \n\nFirst course:  We started with a Kumamoto Oyster wrapped in smoked salmon topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet and sour miso sauces.  A masterful start!  The 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish! \n\nSecond course:  Shima-aji Sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gel\u00e9e with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  A great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!\n\nThird course:  Bluefin Tuna Sashimi topped with garlic pur\u00e9e and sliced serrano chilies with jalape\u00f1o emulsion over brown rice salsa.  I love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  The brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!\n\nFourth course:  Ocean Trout and Seared Sweet Shrimp Sashimi salad served with m\u00e2che, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing.   Another success!  The peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.\n\nIntermezzo:  A Yuzu Sorbet...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.\n\nFifth course:  Pan-seared Seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a yuzu soy sauce.  As much as I loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!\n\nSixth course:  Grilled Wagyu Beef with Seared Foie Gras served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction.  The oh-so-tender Australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared foie gras.  \n\nSeventh course:  Dashi with Lobster and Enoki Mushroom with Japanese greens.  So simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  They didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  In many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\nEighth course:  A selection of sushi...Otoro (fatty tuna), Tasmanian Sea Trout, Sea Eel, a fish I can't recall, Mirugai (geoduck), and Tamago (egg omelet).  I love sushi.  I LOVED all of these nigiri!\n\nNinth course:  Shiso (?) Panna Cotta with Strawberry \"Caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  The \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.\n\nAs for our sake, Chris (I think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that Nobu imports its sake from Japan and that it's made especially for Nobu.  I'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  Suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  Chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  We had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  The timing was impeccable!\n\nI'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals I've ever had...at least since I've started yelping!  Each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  It takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if I had to pick one, it was the wagyu and foie gras course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  If you're in Vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to Nobu and have the Omakase Tasting Menu!  You won't regret it!"
