This one is located in the Miracle Mile Shops, but can be hidden if you don't walk down the hallway all the way to the end.  This particular Todai is one of the smaller ones I've been to, but like the other ones, has your typical fare, udon, ramen, tempura, but mostly sushi.  I judge sushi by the nigiri.  The selection was good but not great.  I've seen better. I been there several times, so I like it."

            "review": "By far the best Todai I have ever been to. Love their poke. So fresh and the taste remained the same even after many months since I got to taste them again. Many different sushi to choose from and of course my favorite crab legs, that alone will definitely make me come back every time I am in Vegas.\n\nThere is a good selection of soups and dessert. Did I mention fresh made crepes where you can choose from fruits, chocolate, nuts and caramel stuffing or topping? Don't forget the green tea ice cream, and if you are not so much into the exotic flavor then there's vanilla.\n\nWhat's cool is you can walk off the calories after through the Miracle Mile shops."

            "review": "Buffet sushi?  Doesn't sound like a good idea.  But this place convinced me otherwise.  \n\nTons of good sushi and other buffet items (crab legs, shrimp, teriyaki, salads, etc.) and I really tried my hardest to taste them all.  I don't think there was a single thing that disappointed, which in itself is pretty amazing.  \n\nFood:  5 stars\nService:  3.5 stars (quick to refill drinks and take plates, but took our soy sauce away as they were preparing to close about a half hour later.  Not cool.)\n\nThe one big issue I have with Todai that will probably impact my decision to return?  It's overpriced.  $35 for a dinner buffet?  C'mon.  Even for better-than-average food on the strip, it's still pushing the envelope at that price."

I have to narrow down to following: \nIn sushi: salmon, eel, shrimp roll\nIn grill: yaki soba, shrimp tempura \nIn desert: green tea soft ice-cream, mocha cake, and of course fresh fruits\n\nI didn't try all but may be 80%.  Many others i cannot recommend unfortunately."

Also had oysters, crab legs, and about a billion other things I didn't get to.  I did notice they had carved meat stations for people who like that sort of thing.  Dessert station was a bit small but they had a very good cheesecake and chocolate covered strawberries.  Sushi and chocolate covered strawberries in the same meal = Yum!"

We managed to get line-skipping privileges at one of the buffets and almost forgot that we had purchased a coupon for dinner @ Todai from Tix4Tonight (highly recommended btw for cheaper show tickets). Dinner at Todai only runs until 9:30 on Sunday, and after 10 minutes of high-speed walking we managed to get there from Aria at 9:20 PM. The receptionist was surprisingly nice giving how late we were, and told us that we have 10 minutes to grab all the food we want since they're closing down in 10 minutes. No problem for us! We filled up 5 plates of delicious food with plenty of time to spare and had a delicious dinner. One of the waitresses grabbed an extra bowl for me later when she needed to take away the soysauce so I can pour some extra for myself. Despite the bad timing we got no dirty looks from any of the staff (which would have been quite understandable actualy), so I'm impressed! :)"

Don't worry about all the rice they give you ... simply discard it ... or use it to make the table legs even and sturdy.

ASK TODAI. they sure know how to do it well.\n\nno wet naps. all buffet restaurants that serve craps and osyters and other food that require using hands would give wet naps. NOT this place. all the pictures of food they show you, you won't find any in the restaurants. i didn't expect it to be a 5-star restaurant, but at least be an average one for the price. if i wanted to go cheap, i would rather go to panda express.\n\nfor that price you pay at todai, pls go to Society Cafe at Encore or Bunchoun @ Venetian and you will be sooooo satisfied with about the price you pay for at todai."

            "review": "Todai, Todai - well, this was not to die for, that's for sure. Wish I had read the Yelp reviews before going here instead of while eating here! That will teach me, but so it goes.\n\nHowever, needing to satisfy that raw fish urge that follows me everywhere I go now, we decided to eat here one evening while our carnivore friends did something else. Besides, we had a 10% off coupon and it was within walking distance. Sometimes that's how the choices are made.\n\nI was so excited! A seafood and sushi buffet! I just couldn't imagine what all-you-can-eat of my favorite things was going to be like. I thought it would be amazing for sure.\n\nThere were plenty of things I could've loved here. Unfortunately, no way to possibly try it all. I pretty much settled on sushi alone, and then added some tempura prawns and veggies towards the end.\n\nThe sushi was \"ok.\" So, now I'm becoming a connoisseur I see and can actually tell the difference! Ok, so perhaps this experience was a good thing. There was nothing wrong with it - it just didn't have the same wonderful wow factor that other sushi has given me. But, I persevered and tried almost everything they had set out. The nigiri was better than their rolls and got snapped up quickly by the predominantly Asian clientele  dining here. The tempura I had later on looked fabulous but did not really deliver in taste.\n\nHad I not just been to an all-you-can-eat crab fest last month, I'm sure I would've enjoyed the piles of Snow Crab legs served here, but I skipped those. Tons of other offerings, but little me just wanted raw and I can't consume much, so I didn't try the other choices of Korean BBQ, 3 kinds of soups, stir fry, and lots of cooked fishies. Desserts looked great and Larry had a plate full of those.\n\nService was fast and friendly with our waitress coming by constantly to keep my teacup full and clearing plates.\n\nIn the end, I felt the price had been somewhat high for the quality (around $28 per person to dine here with the discount) and then later on when I was back in our room, I found a 20% off coupon in the hotel magazine. Damn! Wouldn't have made much difference of course, but I hate it when that happens. \n\nI probably would try a different place the next time as I saw other sushi buffets mentioned that sounded better. I'd give 3 stars here but I just felt the price for quality wouldn't justify that."

A friend had told me that I had to \"check it out\", so I did so without consulting the all-knowing Yelp.\n\nNothing special - that about sums it up. They were very stingy with the nigiri sushi and I had to make a request for tuna. The \"chef\" made me two pieces, but didn't refill the serving tray. I kept an eye on him with the plan of getting more, but he didn't during the next 30 minutes that we were there. \n\nOverall, I liked the shrimp tempura with a dipping sauce, salmon sushi, & the over-sized Sprite. Frankly, I was most thrilled that I didn't get the intestinal travel blues since we had tickets for Mystere that evening.\n\nThe $17.99 price isn't too bad if you have modest expectations and a cast iron stomach. =]"

I understand that it is a buffet and so the quality of the food will not be optimal, but it was pretty horrible.\n\nThe food is bland and the sushi isn't very good.  Everything seems very low in quality and I suppose that this is due to the quantity.  I tried this place twice with a close friend and the second time I don't even know why I agreed to it.  I suppose it was because we were STARVING and really wanted sushi at this point...it seemed silly to have driven all the way to the strip just to drive back off and find a good sushi place.  I will NEVER go again.  It is a waste of money and quite a bit of money at that!"

If you don't like sushi, then there are plenty of hot entrees to choose from as well.  You're sure to find something you like.\n\nDon't forget to save room for dessert.  The crepes are made right there in front of you, and they taste delicious!  There are plenty of mini desserts to choose from and sample.  All of them are much better than the ones found in Chinese restaurant buffets.\n\nI recommend eating here rather than at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market buffet."

It didn't feel or taste fresh. They take forever and a million more years to make ONE new roll. Geez!! I didn't dare try a lot of the raw stuff. Who knows how long it's been there. \n\nI basically stuck to everything else but the sushi. The dessert was delicious though. My favorite was the chocolate cheesecake.\n\nMy advice, you're in Vegas, and for about the same price, you can for sure go to a much much better restaurant. Try something that you don't normally see. I live in Northern California and Todai is around a lot.\n\nIt's too unnecessarily expensive to be honest."

If you come midweek for dinner you will be pleased. They don't rush you and you'll have good value for the money. I've been to Todai in NYC and California and they both were terrible.

They even managed to mess up a vegetable chow mein. I thought I was finally in luck when I saw the chow mein filled hot off the pan in front of me, but I was wrong. There were loads of vegetables, but they were heavily doused in a thick-and-shiny, oily coat of what I presumed to be margarine. Why couldn't they have just cooked the vegetables in water, maybe add a touch of salt, some spices? It was so thick going down, a few bites stuck with me all the way back to the Bellagio, where I washed it down with whiskey.\n\nI really don't understand how people can enjoy the food here, or anything else here for that matter."

Not sure if this was because of the hour or it is how they always stock it up.\nWas it awesome sushi? Not really comparing it to a sit down restaurant paying by the roll, but it was awesome sushi for a buffet.\n\nThe hot food was decent, the fresh grilled octopus was delicious, the first batch had been there a while and was extremely tough.\n\nThe Udon soup was very flavorful and you can decide what you wanted in it.\n\nThey have a tappenyaki station which I never even visited, my daughter would be so mad at me :) \n\nI am not much of a dessert person, not that I needed it, but I tried the green tea ice cream which was pleasant.\n\nServer kept the table clear of empty dishes and was prompt refilling my water.\n\nGreat choice for someone wanting a major sushi fix and has friends that want something besides sushi.\n\nYou can get a discount for going on your birthday, the amount off depends on how many people are in your party. 15% off up to free."

Other items there are just so-so, including crabs for dinner.\n\nThis Todai got 1-star not for its food but for its attitude. It was a few years ago. We were planning to have a quick lunch there before we go to the airport. We arrived before it opened for lunch and there was a very long line before us, but we figured we could still make it. However, it was not opened as scheduled, although I saw waitresses inside chatting with each other to kill time. 15 minutes passed and still no one opened the door or just explain to the crowd what was happening and when the door would be opened.\n\nI can accept mediocre food for the price but this restaurant showed no respect for customers and I will never go there again."

But when you're in Vegas, sometimes it's all about indulging - or overindulging, as the case may be - and on those days, Todai is there for you.  They offer a slew of sushi selections, some sashimi, crab legs (usually only at dinner time), a selection of hot Asian entrees, a selection of salads, some made-to-order noodle soups, and a variety of tastes-like-it-came-from-a-box desserts (one exception:  the made to order crepes are delicious).  \n\nI'm usually a quality hound when it comes to food, but there is nevertheless something truly delightful to me about all-you-can-eat sushi, even if it's a hair on the mediocre side.  I just love it so much and can never get enough of it - except at Todai.  Todai indulges that little girl within me who keeps saying, \"More, more, more!!!!\" even when the adult Michelle knows it was time to stop a while ago.\n\nIt does get crowded, so coming at off-peak hours is your ticket to not having to wait.  Also, check out the ubiquitous coupon books that you can get in the cabs and on the street in Vegas; they often carry coupons for a few bucks off at Todai.\n\nOh, and free meal on your birthday!

But the missus likes the place, and well, you know how that goes.  I just avoid the oysters like they are cursed.\n\nI'm generally okay with Todai as long as I make smart choices.  I've always thought it's a little pricey (when Yama Sushi has a much more fresh tasting menu for a cheaper price), but we went for lunch yesterday, and lunch is a cheaper meal.\n\nExcept for yesterday.\n\nWhat should have been a $20 dollar meal turned out to be $40 a person.  Why, you ask?  Mother's Day.  So let me get this straight: To celebrate the love and all of the wonderful things our Mothers have done for us throughout our lives, the restaurant decides to celebrate Mom by charging double their regular prices on the same meal selections they offer the other 364 days of the year?\n\nGod, I'm going to dread seeing how they decide to honor our Dads.\n\nSeriously, no balloons, flowers, nothing.  The server made no mention of the price doubling, though they maintained they had a sign out front.  And to their credit, they did... in a fairly discreet location that you could miss if you didn't go down the right walkway to get into the restaurant.\n\nThe people in front of us complained, as did we, and the manager very nicely apologized and gave us 20% off the meal's cost, though it was still more than what an average lunch would cost.  No incentives or unique items did not make it worth it.\n\nI imagine I'll be back as the missus loves this place, and well, you know how that goes.  I just felt it was sneaky to double the prices, make no real mention of it (even on the website), and offer nothing to justify the \"value\" of this upgrade. \n\nBad form, Todai.  Bad form."

I came here mostly for the udon. Warm noodle soup after a long night in Vegas? Yes please! I do think that there are better sushi buffets in Vegas (e.g. Makino), but Todai is not a bad option if you're looking for more general seafood/something more than just sushi.\n\nInside it's spacious and has the same decor as all Todai's. Oddly, even though there were plenty of open tables when my group of 8 stopped by, when we asked to switch to a table closer to a TV, it caused kind of a ruckus. Other than that, the staff was very nice.\n\nUnlike other buffets, you have to pay extra for drinks, which is kind of a pain. Also, beware-- they clear away the food after lunch, so even though they may let you sit in the restaurant for past the lunch hours, all the food is sadly gone.\n\ntl;dr: I don't really have anything against Todai.

I've been here before for lunch and know that the food here is PHENOMENAL. Still not sure I peaked inside, saw crab legs and knew that I was going to get my money's worth. I did it right tonight.\n\nYou'll find a nicely decorated restaurant. Pay attention when checking  out the place. A fruit bar, in the middle of the restaurant, is an octopus that comes from the ceiling. How fitting for a sushi joint. The restaurant is well lit, clean and has a hip and trendy yet casual look that fits nicely into Vegas. My guess is that this place gets more than just tourists like me. I'd bet that locals come here quite often.\n\nYou'll find all types of sushi: typical California rolls to octopus, to different variations of tuna and salmon rolls.  I had a very significant share of their sashimi. Easily $20 worth served in any sushi restaurant. Their crab legs were not only delicious but the crab meat came out just perfect to dip into their melted butter. I think I had eight raw oysters, an easy $15 in any restaurant back home in Virginia Beach. They even serve hot foods to cater those who are intimated by raw fish. I tried a small piece of their prime rib and really enjoyed their flavorful bacon wrapped asparagus.\n\nI finished off my fat kid adventure with an okay tasting green tea cheesecake. But what I really enjoyed was the strawberry-banana crepe offered in the dessert section made in front of me.\n\nThe best part of my trip here was my request for wet naps because of my sloppiness with my crab legs. I was expecting those stupid packaged wet naps you get at the store. Nope. We were given hot wet towels! Simple, but a short and awesome experience after a delicious dinner.\n\nOkay, so I'm not often interested in spending $32 on my any meal but I will certainly come back again...perhaps even on this trip."

I started off with the sushi and thought it was decent. Some pieces fell apart which made it hard to eat but it still tasted pretty good.  Then, I had chow mein. I LOVE chow mein so I'll pretty much eat it everywhere I go. It was definitely decent but not wow I need more ASAP. I also tried the Udon soup and I really enjoyed the broth.  The tofu they put in my bowl did not taste good with the broth though. I felt like the tofu had another taste that didn't fit well with the brother. The desserts were super cute! They're bite size and pretty good. I tried the flan and the chocolate piece of cake. It wasn't outta this world but I still ate it. After the server dropped off our check, she never came back. We got our waters refilled from a server who was refilling everyone's water. The service as well as food was satisfactory for paying about $23 each after tax. The atmosphere was the nicest part probably, more than the food. I say if you want to eat A LOT then it's worth it. I was wearing a slim dress so I could barely breathe after my 2nd full plate! The food is good enough where you can eat large amounts. I think I didn't eat enough because I didn't recognize some of the foods they had so I didn't try it.

Unfortunately, the one in SJ closed and they turned it into Tomi now?

My friend also had great childhood memories at Todai herself when she used to go Hawaii so she said we definitely have to hit this one up! We went for lunch like around 12:30pm, which was about $22 on a Saturday and it was still pretty slow so we got seated quickly.  I was so eager to see what they have for seafood but it wasn't much and they didn't have that baked shrimp I was dreading for but it fulfilled some of my seafood cravings, and luckily they have udon, which cured my hangover.  The sushi was good, very small which was a good thing so you wouldn't get too full and tired from eating the same roll and they had a crepe station as well!  They had dessert and they were all mini too, so cute! but the strawberry cheesecake was pretty dry so I had to pass on that and just got a crepe instead.  I think the Todai I had in SJ was great as far as I can remember.

Is it that hard to wash a tablecloth?\n       - Yummy - A lot of the non-sushi items are quite good, such as the crab and baked shrimp. However, for this price and the fact that this is a sushi buffet, I think they've missed their mark.\n**Price**\n       - $19.95 Lunch Weekday Buffet\n       - $21.95 Lunch Weekend Buffet\n       - $31.95 Dinner Weekday Buffet\n       - $33.95 Dinner Weekend Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=6Svn8N_PGnbXqiXqoaYsBQ)\n**Ordered**\n       - Prime Rib and other meats - They were disappointingly dry and tasteless.\n       - Sushi - All of the rolls are generic and uninventive. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=QjFBUjv_lA4FBkM2VhjBog , http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=1ScG5oGsdKNFmbatM_JtRA , http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=jTAljakiUhHQ2kKxWDb_BQ)\n       - Sashimi - Salmon, Tuna, White Fish. The salmon was pretty fresh, but it was almost always empty.\n       - Oysters - Given it's June, I guess I can't blame them for not having fresh oysters. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=gb4eC0Vju4VCSxteiHs68Q)\n       - Baked Shrimp - A lot smaller than their baked prawns, but they're still pretty good. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=zy_n8EHfNnFGFItdxGnEmw)\n       - Cocktail Shrimp - A little small compared to other buffets at this price range. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=ZSdcQvt0oHJxr17HQLrJtQ)\n       - Crab Legs - Fresh with crisp shells. However, they lack flavor. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=zWgGzVKsrZPmVpuk8MyH1Q)\n       - Dessert - Their made to order crepes and creme brule are delicious. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA?select=Q0HICJI4TvbJvZuN0diD2g)\n**Recommendations**\n       - I wouldn't recommend this place. The quality used to be so much better. However, it seems that they've since raised their prices and lowered the culinary bar."

The buffet was just a vast sea of mediocrity at best.\n\nOne funny story though when I was living in NYC and came here with a friend. We had eaten a ton for lunch and were stuffed to the gills BUT THEN my friend saw they made crepes in the back.  He loves crepes more than almost anything in the world.  SO...he went to the bathroom to puke so he could have some room for crepes!!!  RIDICULOUS!!"

When i heard thay they had Todai in Vegas, i was excited and finally decided to do something about my sushi roll addiction.\nWe were seated right away as it was lunch on a Thursday. To my surprise, the restaurant wasn't busy at all even compared to other restaurants inside the Planet Hollywood. All that aside, I rushed to grab my first plate. My first plate consisted of different kinds of rolls they had and some nigiri. They had your everyday california roll to spider roll, dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, caterpillar roll, and even 'chef's special' roll. All the rolls were good, although nothing special. I did like one of their rolls but I cannot remember what it was called. It was shrimp tempura stuffed with rice and something else, but it was pretty good. All the fish used for nigiri sushi was fresh and it wasn't too overloaded with rice which is very important in my opinion when it comes to sushi. \nFor my second plate, I got everything else they had besides rolls. They had several kinds of tempura (shrimp and vegetables), chicken and beef variations, fried rice and noodles, and, to my surprise, turkey (random). Their tempura was good, as it was crispy and not so greasy, just how I like them. They also had Teppanyaki station, but I didn't get to try because I was already stuffed. Now their udon is the good stuff. I don't expect much when eating udon at a buffet after trying udon at Makino at the Premium Outlet on Charleston (their soup for udon was terrible). Todai's udon was great! Their soup was very well flavored, without overusing artificial flavor (not sure about this but it didn't taste like artificial flavor loaded soup).\nTheir desserts are not bad. I had some green tea ice cream which was good and 2 dollar coffee with refills? not bad not bad.\nOverall, very satisfied. Food was great, service was good, and ambiance...not bad. I would like to go back in the near future."

Stop by a Tix4Tonight booth on the strip and by yourself a $2 coupon and the buffet will cost you about $27, so about $29 total before tax and tip.   We went there on Wednesday night(10-9-13) and once again the Snow Crab legs were decent size, fresh, and delicious.  They're not already opened for you which some people may not like, but I prefer them this way as they're kept more fresh and don't dry out.  The sushi was again very good for a buffet, especially the sashimi.   Probably the best sashimi and overall sushi selection at a buffet in Vegas.  They have other hot foods also, but their seafood, sushi, and sashimi is the best bet and well worth the price of admission all by themselves.  Their prime rib was actually juicy and good also on this particular trip, but still not at the level of other pricier buffets.  The biggest surprise on this particular visit to Todai was the raw oysters.  I usually never eat more than 1 or 2 raw oysters at any buffet including Todai because they're typically not 'fresh', no matter how fancy the buffet is.  But this time the raw oysters were completely fresh with a perfect slightly salty taste and no strange after taste.  So I had about a dozen which was a rare treat.  The desert bar is fairly minimal, but my choices of chocolate-covered strawberries, pumpkin pie slices, and creme brulee were delicious and sufficient.   Overall, if you want all-u-can-eat good seafood and a solid selection of other foods and you don't care about having a fancy decor, you just can't beat this buffet for the price.   Friendly staff also.  We will continue to visit this buffet on every trip to Vegas."

Simple ol' me from 6 years ago was content with their sushi, sashimi, tempura, desserts, etc.  It's called settling.\n\nThen when I moved to Vegas 6 years ago and started trying AYCE sushi restaurants, I was enlightened.  I started noticing things that I didn't before.  Loosely made rolls, dry sushi rice from sitting in the open too long, imperfectly cut sashimi (I'm hoping they don't use a butter knife to slice fish) -  all these details started to bother me.  That's the problem with chains - quality isn't there.\n\nThe location is good.  You can just do valet right outside Planet Hollywood (east side).  So, if you're a tourist or don't know any better, Todai might be ok until you try smaller AYCE sushi restaurants this city has to offer.\n\nYou can eat for free on your birthday.  They have a chocolate fountain and that's about it."

The plentiful hot selections, as well as the teppanyaki and udon offerings make this a great destination for fans of the Japanese cuisine, who don't want to wait forever in line.  \n\nAnd of course - don't forget the desserts and drinks: we loved the Sho Chiku Bai Nigori unfiltered cold sake!

It's not that my husband hadn't had sushi before I came along, only that I actually broadened his food horizons. In addition to sushi (this is ok), there is a custom cooking section (good, but there is a slight wait time), hot foods like tempura (try the yams), stuffed shrimp (good), and teriyaki chicken (kind of fatty), a cold salad section like seaweed salad ( I love this salad) and a handful of others, the crab legs (better than most casino buffets- really favorful- we like to get a full plate of this) and full dessert section with ice cream, cheesecake bites, carrot cake bites, cookies, and candies (seriously you will want to try some of these delicious sweet things). Since there is a huge selection, it is hard not to find something for everyone.  \n\nSince I don't want to be sick and get rolled out of the restaurant, I pace myself. I only get what I really want and I save room for dessert- ice cream, of course! My rule is two plates of food. I want to be satisfied but I don't want to overdo it. I use the rule of moderation. \n\nThe service is excellent. The staff is very attentive and eager to please; filling drinks and taking the dirty dishes away. It's nice that there is a bathroom in the restaurant. There are numerous tvs all around and there is music playing (but you can't hear it if the place is pretty crowded).  Also, don't forget about the crab- it's really good. (We went to the one in Hawaii but were disappointed that it wasn't really all you can eat- there was a person handing out two pieces of crab legs.) In the beginning I wrote that this used to be our birthday tradtion- the birthday promotion used to be BOGO, but now, the promotion is BOGO, if there are six people in your party. In the AAA coupon book (AAA customers- you get this at the customer service desk, upon entering the center via the parking garage), there is a 10% off coupon and I believe that there is an ongoing Locals promotion, of 10% off.\n\nIn a world of mediocre casino buffets (Las Vegas, lets be honest), this is still better than many of the ones available (not worth the time or money). All things considered, it's also in a good location, the Miracle Mile Shops in the Planet Hollywood Casino."

Their sushi selection was just ok, I would say the sushi and sashimi was low quality.  I saw that there were people eating crab and lobster but Todai was very slow to bring out the lobster, seemed like only once in a while so you may or may not have a chance to eat it.

I've been doing the research into Todai's/Makino's for months, but I really don't want to go to a buffet by myself.  (I guess I'm weird that way.)  Our eating habits: the only thing that consumes more than me is fire, so any place is fine with me; she is a vegetarian who eats fish, eggs and dairy products, so I am always careful and mindful of her dietary restrictions.  Since I haven't had sushi/Japanese cuisine for quite a while, we went here for dinner.\n\nI've only been to one other Japanese buffet (in the States), and that was Minado's in Framingham, MA.  That buffet was good; my mission there was to eat my fill of sushi (and other Japanese delicacies, but sushi primarily), and I went there two different times.  They had a nice selection of foods, and I was happy I went.\n\nTodai's is another beast altogether.  At least twice the amount of choices available (as compared to Minado's selection).  Some stuff I've heard about, but was never able to try (like the spicy Hawaiian poke). I seriously tried to take a sampling of everything, but to tell the truth, I was so hungry by the time we got there (last meal was dinner the night before) I knew I should have worn a bathrobe or a hospital gown.  My attempt to sample a wee bit of everything failed miserably; when I got back to my table with my plate, the waribashi was a blur from the plate to my face.  (I should have asked for a Diet Coke, ha ha ha.)  I do remember, after walking back to the Luxor and climbing into bed, we both had the sushi sweats.  I swear, when I find someone else to go with to Todai's the next time, I'll take it easy.  I really need to plan buffets a lot better in the future.\n\nOoh, the recommendation.  Yes, go to Todai, and bring your appetite.  Dudes:  let's cut through the fluff and just wear your sweatpants.  Ladies: I know you want to at least give the appearance of being ladylike, but indulge yourself.  And for you pre- and post-op gender reassignment patients:  well, I can't help you there."

It is a little over $20 per person during lunch and I dont know how much it is during dinner time. \n\nWe started of at the sushi area which was okay given that its a buffet. Then went for the fried rice, chow mien, lettuce wraps,  fried shrimp, gyozas,....etc. everything we ate was tasted pretty generic, typical, replica, Asian food. what else can i say other than eating as much as i can for what I paid for. \n\nservices was OK from what i saw. it was bad enough that they opened late. we got seated and asked what drinks we wanted and practically didn't see the waitress after that. They refilled our drinks by carrying pitchers of the different soda, water, tea with them. They cleared out any empty plates on your table. They would show up with your receipt when they think your done eating. so with service is okay at a buffet place.\n\nWe went here friday when they opened and it started to get pretty crowded. my only advice is to come when they open so you can get pretty much everything you want to eat."

There were many maki rolls, nigiri sushi, salads with sashimi, seaweed salad, tempura, rib-lets, udon...etc, etc.  Oh, and there is a whole length of dessert buffet I did not even touch cuz I was saving every cubic inch of stomach space for seafood.  The sashimi salad and seafood soup were my favorites.  \n\nTo a seasoned seafood lover such as myself: nothing was too exciting but everything was good.  Yes, the sushi buffet I had at Sumo in LA was way better, and the various tiny authentic sushi bars offered me more exotic choices.  but hey, I'm here in Vegas and this is a good giant buffet. \n\n One tip:  if you don't like sashimi or nigiri and consider multi-ingrediented maki rolls your favorite sushi;  save yourself about $10 pp and go for the lunch buffet."

Even the desserts were numerous and delicious-- definitely the first time I've had cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e at a sushi joint.

The crab legs were plentiful but cold. (No drawn butter there!) There's enough food for the non-seafood eater to enjoy as well.

I was actually sitting next to the table today that  complained about the $5 bowl of rice that the elderly lady was going to be charged because she was eating. I understand that she is an elder but she was eating and Todai is a buffet. Buffets are a set price there are no exceptions anywhere. I don't understand the commotion the customers were making about this issue. Ethnicity has nothing to do with the situation and overhearing the conversation that since the management is \"Korean\" they should understand more for the elder. It's a business and why should one customer get treated any better than the next? The management wasn't trying to charge a full senior price because they understood she wasn't eating much. Which is why they were only charging her a to-go price for the rice. Only reason I'm writing this review is because the complaining customers caused a big yelling scene that interrupted my family's dining experience. If anything I feel bad for the management to put up with customers like Cindy. \nI will continue to bring my family to Todai Las Vegas for the great food and awesome customer service. The desserts and sushi here are amazing!!! You definitely get your money's worth!!! \nAnd to the management im sorry you guys have to deal with those rude customers during the holidays."

If you like sushi, they have quite a few choices and they have a full Japanese buffet in addition to the sushi.\n\nThe only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because you have to get up and walk back to the buffet line if you want napkins, so don't forget them. I think napkin holders would be a good investment because getting back up when you're ready to eat is inconvenient. \n\nThe waiters aren't very personable either. They don't say much, but that's not such a big deal. It cost $35 per person last time we went (about a month ago), so its not too hard on your wallet."

A $40 buffet may not be unheard of in Vegas, but anywhere else people would look at you like an alien if you invited them along to such a place. Regardless, the fish is fresh, as are the crab legs. They have a bunch of different kinds of salads that are great too. I don't really get involved in the rolls they have (which they have tons of) or the other food items (think hot meats/noodles/pizza/etc). They also offer a fruit station and a dessert station that is adorable with tiny little one bite desserts. A bottle of wine would run you around $30, though I've never done it since I'm a cheapskate. \n\nExpect to overeat and regret it for at least 48 hours."

After eating here the next day I felt like I was going To Die! \nLet me start from the beginning, the service was awful they never came back to refill my water. I had to wave someone down to come refill my drink and they never came to check on us during our meal. Not once! \nAlso the food was disgusting. Usually I can find one thing I like but no everything tastes nasty. Maybe it was because they had 2 hours until closing but still. Everything was cold and old. Even the miso soup was nasty. How do you mess that up?! Don't eat the crab legs what ever you do!!! I got really bad food poisoning and after reading others reviews I think it was from the crab. Or the combination of all the raw food sitting out for hours because all the sushi rolls looked old and not good. All in all I would never ever tell anyone to eat here ever! Not even my worst enemy. I got so sick I felt like I was going to die. I'm a local here in Vegas born and raised and my recommendation would be just to go off the strip and go to sushi mon or something way better. And it's not expensive. For what I paid at Todai I thought I'd at least get good service. But no I paid an arm and a leg to get food poisoning and rude servers. I highly don't recommend eating here!

So..... MOSTLYY (yep meant to put that in there) I avoid these types of eating establishments. However, doing some entertaining with friends/family in town, and the BFF wanting to try this place for such a long time, I decided to suck it up and go. And not so surprisingly I was soooo miserable when I went home. However the food was very delish. The selection of Sushi that they had (for someone who really only likes a couple of different kinds of rolls) was a really nice selection covering several different likes (IMHO). \n\nAfter the sushi was done, it was time to check out some dessert (yes, even with as miserable as I was, I could not pass it up). There is a table at the far end of the buffet line that has mini desserts (which allows for tasting quite a few of their yummy desserts) a crepe station, and a ice cream machine that the lady behind the table has to serve you. It was sort of a bummer that the person waiting for a crepe was blocking the yumminess that could have gone on my ice cream but I just didn't want to be like 'dude, move along, she'll let you know when the crepe is done' but I didn't. I just got my plate of lotsa mini desserts, teeny bowl of ice cream and went back to my table to devour it all, and feel quite satiated from there.\n\nI am not sure when we will make it back. When we are back down in the neighborhood we might consider dropping in again. However I am new to Vegas mostly new anyways... and I have lots of places I would like to get around to :-)"

The meats, prime rib, roast pork, were beyond dry. Yes, I understand that it comes with gravy and au jus, but when a meat has to rely that much on sauces for flavoring, then the chefs definitely ruined the meat. The udon center was a joke. The noodles were frozen noodles that you can get in any convenient store, and the miso broth tasted like they simply used ramen packets to flavor it. \n\nMy opinion, save your money and go to McDonalds."

The crab legs were small and all snapped up by the patrons in less than five minutes. Sushi was unimpressive with a lot of rice for one sushi roll. It was not as fresh and until the tray was completely empty, only then would they refill it with fresh sushi. The desserts are the only highlight for me with custom crepes, green tea cheesecake slices, and mango yogurt.

In fact, of all the times I have been there I barely eat any sushi unless I ask for a specialty item like the uni nigeri (they only give you two at a time, but I mean...that's understandable.  I wouldn't want to waste loads of sea urchin of some nub who thought he'd like it and didn't).  I usually stick with the tuna and salmon sashimi, poki salad, and cucumber salad.  I've never eaten off the hot bar.\n\nAnd I eat the desserts, of course.  They offer a decent selection of petite desserts.  My favorite is the red bean paste cakes.\n\nBut back to the atmosphere--it is a nice place to hang out with a group friends if you don't mind paying a good deal for average food.  The restaurant is very open with fun decorations like octopus tentacles hanging from the ceiling and bright colors.  They don't impose a time limit like some all-you-can-stuff-in-your-pie-hole sushi places (one time, we were there for almost two hours..) or gripe if you leave rice on the plate.  I've never ordered drinks there, but I think they charge per glass on pop.  Water for the win.\n\nLunch runs around seventeen dollars I think and dinner goes around twenty eight."

This buffet, which is located at the back of the MIracle Mile Shops is no different.\n\nI've eaten so much sushi in my life that I was quite saddened by this experience. The pieces were small, not as fresh as they could be and the presentation was off.

I find this to be indicative of high customer service.\n\nAfter we were seated, the service was amazing.

They do have straight up slabs of salmon and tuna, but their rolls are filled with crab salad and not real crab.

You may want to save your money if you're not into seafood. \n\nWhile this place didn't impress me with food or style, it impressed me with service. And for $30, I couldn't complain."

            "review": "In the land where the buffets are boss, do people really still prefer Todai? Evidently the temptation of Japanese seafood is too powerful to resist as even I have been here on multiple occasions. Through it all, there are better Japanese AYCE spots in the city, but what it may boil down to for most is the warm comforts a chain can bring.\n\nThe Miracle Mile of Planet Hollywood is no stranger to franchised storefronts, after all its the back bone of so many Vegas entities from casinos to restaurants. Where this Todai comes into play is the fact its the only Japanese branded buffet on the strip, where as anything similar is usually a hodgepodge of Asian items. Todai isn't really uniquely Japanese per se, but it is a great place to burn some moolah for a heap of food.\n\nWhat should come as no surprise to anyone, Todai on the strip carries a semi-hefty price tag ($35 per person), especially during their dinner hour. I personally believe if anyone is going to throw down some bucks, let it be during dinner. Their full arsenal of \"the best stuff\" is likely to be on full display.\n\nWhile the array of sushi rolls are visually appealing, they seem to be heavier on the rice and decorations and just a tad too skimpy with the meat. The same idea applies with the nigiri sushi. While the crab legs are plentiful in numbers, the actual legs themselves don't have a lot of substance. I'm not too hot on the hot food (pun intended), but I will shoot for the occasional baked claim, even if its loaded with mayo and crappy spices. \n\nWhenever possible, shoot for the sashimi, which includes more than just salmon and tuna, but yellowtail, white tuna, and scallops. It may not be overly fresh (just sitting on a bed of ice), but it represents the best of their raw selection and is probably the only way to get one's moneys worth without having to shovel endless food in your mouth. Unfortunately, many others will be adopting this philosophy so the sashimi inventory gets cleaned out pretty quick.\n\nWhile everything noted has been generic and such, the two stars really comes from a lack of quality service. Sure, its a buffet and people are really serving themselves. But the service industry in Las Vegas is regarded as one of the best in the world, especially any establishment in any of the resorts or along the strip. I understand I'm holding Todai to what might be an impossible standard - but there is no excuse for being ignored for drinks or dirty plates almost every visit here.\n\nAt least their desserts rule."

There were about 5 types of rolls and 2 types of sushi. There was no sashimi. They did have some \"tartare\" which had some sort of spicy dressing on top of it. My guess is to disguise the fact that the fish is not fresh. The crab legs were leaking water. There was more water in there than crab meat, showing that the legs have been frozen for a long time and was recently thawed.\n\nEventually I just parked myself near the oyster station and snatched those up as soon as they were prepared just so i could make the dinner somewhat worth the $34, although I would've had to eat a lot more oysters to get there.\n\nSave your money and go to McDonalds instead.

Boy was I in for a shock.\n\nWhen I walked in, I was a little disappointed by their overall selection, it was a bit meek.  I wanted some crab, and they had a lot of it.  The crab was absolutely disgusting, it was inedible in fact.  I rarely take things out of my mouth, but I simply could not stomach it.  The few sushi selections they had were alright, which was what the two stars would be for.  When we were asked what we wanted to drink, I wanted green tea, as well as my wife.  It was $4 a piece for two TINY bags of tea and hot water, and the server never came back.  I couldn't believe I was being served tea bags of green tea, not freshly brewed green tea for the EXTRA price I was paying, and the server did not tell me this before I ordered it.  I figured most Vegas buffets include drinks in the price.\n\nThe fruit was fresh, so after the terrible experience at least we paid $70 for fruit.\n\nI contacted Todai corporate twice, both e-mails were ignored to the fullest extent, and I doubt they are remedying any of these situations.\n\nI felt robbed, and I would have rather dropped that cash on one hand of Blackjack to be honest and I would have been happier."

Folks, there is nothing nastier than non-fresh salmon roe. GROSS.  Some of the other sushi had obviously been sitting for a while as well, leaving me deeply disappointed. It wasn't all awful, but for over $30 per person, old sushi is unacceptable.  \n\nI bumped my rating to three stars because I think during a more crowded period the sushi would be fresh and therefore more worth the price.

Unfortunately, Makinos is located away from the Strip.  Therefore, it is easier to make a trip to Todai instead of Makinos.  If Makinos was located along the Strip, I would always choose Makinos rather than Todai."

Having said that, the quality of their sushi is still so-so. There are many better sushi buffet place if you are willing to venture away from the strip. The location is convenient though. For those without a car, this is still a good place to get some budget friendly sushi fix. Still better than the sushi counter at Wynn or Bellagio buffets."

We went for lunch, which gives you more time to recover versus dinner, LOL.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect based on many average reviews.  But for the cost, and a coupon, it was what I was hoping for.  Plenty of sushi and helpful service.  It's a buffet!!  It's not Nobu or another high-end chic sushi place.  You can't possibly expect them to give you multiple $12 plates and stay in business.  Food courts on the Strip can easily cost you what we paid per person and still leave you hungry.  It was also nice to finally get some fruits and veggies in Vegas, since they can be hard to find or too costly to add.\n\nCustomer service was just fine.  We had no issues with plates stacking up or drinks not being filled.  All of the staff members were helpful and courteous.  Philly rolls were quickly snapped up and they made more, so no complaints.  Having the coupon savings translated to leaving a better tip, too.  We thought we'd be punished by using a coupon since many expect those customers to be cheap.  But the savings allowed us to pay it forward."

I have to say that the ratings were probably by \"passing\" tourist. \n\nHere is the low-down.  The reason they have a high one star is because of decent service and nice layout.  \n\nThe food should be rated a zero or negative.  This place is called Todai Sushi and Seafood Buffet Restaurant.  Uhhh, if you come here for sushi, you are definitely at the wrong place.  Sushi dishes were awful.  God, it was PIT-I-FUL!!!!  The rice tasted bland and the seaweed wrap was like eating sandpaper.  It was gross... yuk yuk yuk\n\nAs for their other dishes, crablegs were cold and limited, steaks and prime rib were overcooked.  \n\nAnd, what, they charge 34.99??  Kinda pricey man!!!\n\nAgain, as a sushi fan in Vegas, I would not recommend this place.  There are so many other places with better sushi in town. Try Extreme Sushi in Henderson... great people, great food, and price is only $18.99 or so for AYCE.  Also, I would recommend Sushi-Mon in Henderson.  It is more pricey $26.99, but it is very good!!\n\nCheers!!"

I don't give a damn though and keep coming up for more because I paid a lot for my dinner. They'll even go so far as to say it'll take 20 MINUTES to prepare between orders even though we all know uni is raw, and pre-cut. All you need to do is slap a ball of rice on it and hand it over the glass counter.\n\nSeriously, just hand over the uni and nobody gets hurt. \n\nIf you're a local and you have a car, look up OYSHI RESTAURANT and eat there instead. It's $26 per person for all-you-can eat dinner, not $35, has a far larger selection (but it's all sushi and specialty rolls, no hot foods and American stuff but who cares?), and the service and quality is infinitely superior to Todai.

They feature many Asian salads, a hand rolling corner, crepe corner, noodle corner, carving station and micro mini fancy desserts. The sushi is middle of the road sushi, not high end but good and rolled very small the way it should be. Everything I tried was fresh and had mackerel , tuna and salmon sushi.I liked the kimchi here, it wasn't too sour. They had another salad that looked like kimchi but was spicy napa cabbage that was slightly sweet. My favorite salad was the green tea chasoba. The tempura was fresh and light. Beer, wine and sake are available.\n\nI would rate 4 stars for lunch during the week. (around $20)\n\nThe price is higher on the weekends and increases for dinner. (around $23 and $33)\nThere is a coupon in the Vegas magazine for $5 off\n\nFor around $20 for lunch during the week in Vegas it's a pretty good lunch."

Besides the higher price, my only other con is the room is vast and not very intimate.  But I will return. I liked virtually everything I tried, which is often not the case at most buffets.  I tried the eel, clam soup, rainbow roll, salmon sashimi, mixed seafood tempura sushi, tempura veggies, baked salmon, shrimp, shrimp puff thingy, bacon wrapped asparagus, miso soup (eh), seaweed salad, mint white chocolate, key lime pie, cr\u00e8me brulee, and had a ginger ale.  Service was good also.  But I have come to expect that in most places in Vegas."

No, it was $5 off the whole ticket, and dinner is $35+ per person. So, with the thought in mind that I better be able to enjoy $35+ worth of food, we went in. \n\nI found the Sushi/Sashimi selection to be very good, and would only have like a little more description of what it was, but I know a little about what I won't eat (fish roe) and what I will (raw Tuna, Salmon, White Fish) to be able to get just what I want and try something new. \n\nI did try the hot bar because I was so hungry I wanted some rice and chicken to settle my stomach before the Sushi/Sashimi, and I thought it was good. Not great, but good.\n\nDesert was odd as I wasn't in the mood for green tea ice cream, so I tried the bite-sized cheesecake, mango cake, etc. It was all good, but it didn't mesh with the rest of the menu very well.\n\nOverall, I left full, but not uncomfortable, and was not hungry later the way I am with most Asian foods. I would definitely recommend Todai, but maybe for lunch, instead of dinner."

The tempura was pretty good. There was a meet carvings and made to order crepes but I didn't try any of that. They do have soft serve green tea ice cream which you never see at buffets. I think dinner has crab legs and prime rib. Definitely a must stop every time I come to Vegas. It's the best bang for your buck. We paid $2 at Tix4Tonight booth so dinner was only $16.95 as opposed to $21.95. Compared to other lunch buffets on the strip that will cost close to $30, this was definitely worth it."

Most CA locations are closed now, so I've only heard the stories...\n\nEven when they open at 5:30 for dinner, there are people waiting. Staff is smiling and prompt,  the fresh and large buffet selection awaits. Service was attentive, but as others have pointed out, silverware and napkins are out on the floor and need to be picked up separately. Minor irritation that there are plastic cups available for condiments by the prime rib station, but not by the cocktain sauce or tempura sauce stations- odd and a little inconvenient. Not to mention the soy sauce on the tables but no cups for that, either.\n\nHighlights include the make your own udon and dessert crepe sections, the veggie tempura spread, and of course- the seafood. No, the quality isn't what you'll find at the nicer AYCE places off-Strip, but the fish is super fresh and there is a small selection of sashimi, and the quality IS better than your average buffet. \n\nI really liked that there were about 12 rolls out on display, with labels. No confusion about what random roll I was eating, and the pieces weren't packed with tons of rice. I rather enjoyed that the pieces were cut small, so that I could try a bit of each rather than just a few before filling up.\nIn addition to sushi and sashimi, I also filled up on poke and shrimp cocktail, my usual buffet stand-by. Crab legs are also available at weekday dinner, but I did not partake.\n\nEDIT; two months later, I'm subtracting a star for lack of consistency. Raved about this place to a fish-loving friend and visited for lunch just after picking him up from the airport. Got here just before 1PM and selection was limited, fish seemed questionably fresh, and overall experience was extremely underwhelming- I was embarrassed to bring someone here."

I can't say  much about the sushi, other than the california roll had a nice crunchy cucumber in it, and the rice was pretty decent.  The tempura was okay.  The shrimp was good, but the yam didn't have much flavor.  They have some pretty good ribs.  There was also pork belly, but I'm afraid of all that fat.  I can't imagine wanting to eat solid fat, I just can't.  They had some pretty tasty clams.  There were also some crab legs in there, but I was too lazy to eat crab.  After going to the Wynn buffet the day before, I didn't even look at their desserts.  Nothing could possibly compare...  They had some pretty sweet watermelon, canteloupe, and honeydew though.  (Don't eat the fruit cocktail when the fresh stuff is way better.)\n\nService was okay until we wanted to leave.  Then for some reason, we couldn't.  Took forever for them to get my check, and after about 15 minutes of sitting around and being told that someone would be around in a few, I finally got up and went to the cashier's desk to get my credit card back."

So instead go for the nigiri, it's not the most fresh sushi ever, but it still tastes better than piling on endless amounts of \"toppings\" and calling it some absurd roll like a 'cats paw roll'.\n\nLastly, I suggest you stock up on the tempura because it's something everyone loves and it's not very difficult to make / screw up.\n\nI also came on a Tuesday near the end of their lunch time, meaning it wasn't too packed but for some reason the service still took 'forever and a half' to help us...

Endless variety, very fresh, very tasty, and wonderful atmosphere.\n\nFor some reason unbeknownst to me, there have been a fair amount of negative reviews of other Todai locations posted here. This has led to the closing of two of my favorites - studio city (LA) and Chicago. I was extremely sad when the Chicago todai closed, since that was the closest one to where I live (Indiana) and I had driven 3 hours just to eat there.\n\nPlease don't believe the negative reviews and please don't let this todai location go under too! It's too good. If you like sushi or seafood at all, give it a try. Every time I'm in las Vegas I eat here at least twice - and given the competition for seafood buffets in Vegas, that's saying something."

If you have ever gone to a true sushi place, the sushi chefs spend lunch/early afternoon filleting fish, doing the prep work\n\nIt does have a place and a function, and I didn't see anything that would make people ill - but \"Meh\" fits"

Some sweets that they have include: cheesecakes (a variety including green tea cheesecake), ice cream (including green tea flavor), chocolate/stawberry mousse, cookies, cakes (including green tea flavored), jello, and everybody's favorite: a fresh cr\u00eape maker.\n\nDefinitely check out my photos of the food because it will give you a tenfold better idea of what this place is all about.

What would you hope to experience in such place with price $34/ ticket on a regular dinner (not at the weekend)?\nThey carries most kinds of food like any other asian buffets as you expected: sushi, crab legs, shrimps, salads, tempuras, stirred fried vegetable, fried noodle, fried rice, beef, sausage, dessert including crepe served by order, 2 flavors ice creams, cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e, cakes, cookies.

Table and chairs are as much standard as you might see at some affordable restaurants in a China Town. \n4. Restroom looks dirty, not well maintenance.\n  \nI admit they have good salads, veggie tempura, stirred fried crab.

            "review": "Wow.....I am taken aback by the number of high ratings for this restaurant as compared to my experience.   And here's MY bottom line up front:  if you are going here because you are a sushi lover, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  For the price of this dinner ($31.95/person for dinner Sun - Thurs) you can go to a very good sushi house and get your fill of really good sushi.  Folks, this is an all you can eat Chinese buffet with more sushi type offerings than most, but it is NOT great sushi at all.  I am giving this a \"2\" rating because it wasn't bad, it just wasn't good, nor do I think it lived up to its billing. \n\nAtmosphere:  Based the on line photos on on their website we assumed that this would be a somewhat upscale place.  We assumed wrong.  It was ..... an all you can eat Chinese buffet,complete with food on the floor, paper table covers, and located at the entrance, but inside the shops on the Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood.  Dress ranged from cutoffs, muscle shirts, and flip flops to khakis with button down shirts and dresses.\n\nFood Presentation:  We arrived at 8:00 PM, and although the buffet continues to seat people until 9:30, we were surprised to see so many empty or close to empty trays on the buffet, and many weren't restocked while we were there so it is hard to say how good the buffet might have been if it was fully stocked.  \n\nSushi:  The sushi was okay, but was in no way close to really good sushi.  The pieces were small which was okay since you can have as many as you want.  They were not well put together, and most fell apart when you picked them up from the buffet line.  If they didn't fall apart there, they certainly did when you tried to eat them.  Several pieces were tasty, but most were very bland with little flavor.  The texture ranged from marginally chewy to almost grainy.  The salmon was by far the best piece we had.  \n\nRolls:  There were lots of different rolls available, but the labeling of the offerings was all messed up.  California rolls were marked as spicy tuna, and something labeled \"Shrimp Tempura Roll\" was ..... well I don't know what it was, but it was NOT shrimp tempura.\n\nSeafood:  For a place that bills itself as a \"Sushi and Seafood Buffet\" there wasn't much seafood beyond the sushi.  They advertise dungeness crab as a major offering, but the crab legs were only served cold, not hot.  And they were so salty that a salty food lover with us said that it was TOO salty even for her, so I didn't even try it.\n\nSalads:  The salads presented were also \"okay.\"  Frankly I wasn't very interested in eating too much salad in an all you can eat sushi and seafood buffet,.\n\nHot Food:  The hot food was \"okay\" as well, but again, it was NOT great.  There was a station presenting hand carved prime rib,  pork roast, and grilled sausage, except that there was no one manning it, so you couldn't have any.  I waited about five minutes at the station, making eye contact and waving to every employee running behind the station before I finally got someone to come over.  And it looked like these offerings had been under heat lamps for many hours and perhaps they were because the meat was very dried out.  There were several  trays of baked fish and other hot entrees that had only a very small amount of leftover food on them, and what was left there was dried out and very unappealing.  Perhaps they weren't going to refill these until someone took the last remnants, but looking at the dried up remnants on the corner of a large tray made me decide it wasn't worth trying.\n\nDessert:  This was both a high and low point.  There were a number of good offerings in the dessert line, the chocolate covered strawberries were really good.  there were also a couple cookies that were very tasty.  The low point here is that they offer a \"build your own crepe\" station which looked great.....except that they didn't have anyone manning it to make crepes, rendering it useless."

My wife and I wanted to try it last year during our vacation to Vegas, but ended up going this time around instead.  It was a complete waste of time and money.  I can't say enough bad things about this place.  My wife and I may be a little spoiled when it comes to food, so maybe that's part of the reason we hated this.  \n\nThe sushi was luke warm, much of it was mislabeled and just overall terrible.  My wife had some kind of \"tuna\" that she ended up spitting out because it was so bad.  I had a bunch of crab legs and those were simply \"ok.\"  I also tried a couple of the warm dishes such as the teriyaki chicken, which tasted like it came from Panda Express.  I'm not a huge fish person, but I've grown to like some rolls and sashimi.  This was worse than store bought boxed sushi.  With that said, I went for their \"prime beef,\" thinking there may be a glimmer of hope, but to no avail.  It was gritty and bland.  The potatoes were out of a box.  My wife had a $12.00 glass of plum wine that she couldn't even finish.  You definitely want to avoid a place where you can't even get a decent glass of wine.\n\nThe other patrons were rude and the lines for a crappy crab roll were insane.  People elbowing each other and physically pushing each other for some horrible seafood cevechi.\n\nUltimately, I felt like Clark Griswald in Vegas Vacation when Cousin Eddie takes him to that buffet place and loads a potato sack with rolls.  \"I'll have some of the yellow and don't get cheap on me,\" completely applies to this place.  There are plenty of other options in Vegas to waste $35 per person on food...\n\nBy the time we finished forcing our food down my wife and I both feared for food poisoning.  We were literally sick to our stomachs and grossed out by this dining experience.  Luckily we didn't get sick.  In the end, I probably should have complained to management, but that's not really my style.  I'm sure they wouldn't have done much.\n\nAnyway, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!"

            "review": "So there was multiple conversions posted about AYCE crab legs. I had visitors in town who wanted AYCE crab legs and after finding out my to go spot for crab legs GVR feast buffet no longer served crab legs, and from the girl on the phone no stations buffet does any more, I felt disbelieving. Anyways we was already at Planet Hollywood for a show and stopped by after.\n\nFirst plate snow crabs yes. It was big and good but I don't like cold crab legs I need them hot with all the good seasoning like how Gvr  did them. \n\n2nd and 3rd plate shoyu ahi poke, loaded with sushi, sashimi, and oysters. There was snapper and there was ahi they looked similar to the average eye then that news article posting a while back came up.  If they switched the ahi and snapper ill just eat my moneys worth in oysters.\n\nThe next few plates come and went in a blur, I was already full and only took tiny plates to pace myself just to eat things I really real wanted. There was shrimp tempura, asparagus wrapped in bacon, baked salmon, stuffed mushrooms.\n\nThere was turkey and prime rib but all dry. Some soups and salads and other hot food but not even close to was the website listed. Wanted some blue crab\n\nGood choice in desserts. creme brulee, some fruit tarts and cakes, creeps and green tea ice cream but again not as.much as what the website listed.\n\nThey charge extra for drinks.\n\nMaybe they have a better selection on weekdays. \n\nNice and clean. Like the giant octopus above the fruits area.\n\nDon't like having to grab your own napkin from these dispensers at the buffet area. We had to keep going back up and piles of clean and used napkins took table real estate from food.\n\nSolid 3.5 rating. Because could've gotten almost the same choices at Buffet @Asia which is more than half the price"
