We didn't feel like spending too much money on the strip and were craving some Thai food so we hunted this place down. Couldn't have made a better decision during this trip to Vegas. Amazing! :)"

Hilarious.\n\nOrdered the Duck Rice, Pad Thai (5 was spicy, but enough), stuffed wings and chicken satays.\n\nEverything was absolutely delicious. And this was PLENTY of food for two people to share.\n\nThe peanut sauce for the chicken satays was the best I have ever had :)\nDuck rice had HUGE chunks of duck in it (very visible, unlike my favorite delivery place Thai Style Noodle House)\nPad thai, I thought was delicious, but my friend said his favorite spot Mr. Chop Chop does it better.\n\nService was also very attentive and the meal came to around $50 for the both of us. Also would like to add that this place is way better than Lotus ;)"

The beef panang was disappointment, they just pour the panang sauce over the meat, we expected the beef was stewed with panang sauce for hours, not when the customer order, beside the meat was tough to eat.  The pad-see-ew was not good as Thai restaurants in California.  The only positive is the service."

I usually try to make a stop after a long night of drunken Strip-wandering.\n\nThe last time everything was practically flawless - on this visit, the panang curry and pad see ew were very good, but the pad Thai and fried rice felt like they might be lacking a little something.  I'm convinced when we asked for \"medium\" the staff interpreted that as \"medium for white people\" which means \"almost no heat at all.\"  We did order a pepper chicken dish requested \"hotter than hell\" that had a nice bite to it, at least.\n\nFood is still reasonably priced in good-size portions, and on this particular visit all five of us got a free Thai iced tea.  Never had a crowding problem here either."

Maybe it's because I was there before most of the workers, stalking the parking lot with great anticipation. I knew this was going to be an EPIC lunch! It was an EPIC fail.... My feelings were hurt :( I wanted the panang in the reviews. I wanted the pad thai gasm! I waited about 40 mins after placing the order for two lunch specials and that was fine.. Given I was extra early! But when I made it home, that's when the devastation hit! I wasn't given a delisicious velvety panang it was a grease bowl.  Man, it was just really greasy and seperated. No spice no flair. The pad thai had no flavor in fact it didn't even have one lick of flavor. Flavorlessnesss....hmmmmm... Oh that's it! The sever never asked me a spice level!!!! My earliness must have frazzled him! \n\n\nOn a high note the peanut butter dressing on the salad was very good as was the soup!! That let's me know this place has great potential! \n\nMoral of the dramatic story! Give people a chance to warm up before going! I don't think I'd given them a ompletely fair shot, so I will return one day to try again."

I think we may have only been the non-locals in the joint (a good sign). \n\nI twisted my friend's arm to get the Tom Kha Gai soup. Although it was very oily, it was delicious. Very spicy, but oh so tasty. She twisted my arm to get the fried (!!) spinach. It, too was great.  For our shared entree, we got Papaya Pad Thai. Unfortunately, it was not very good at all.\n\nI think there was only waitress for the whole place and the owner (??) came and helped as well. We were in no hurry and took a very long time with our dinner, so the service that would be considered bad by some, was just perfect for us. \n\nI'd go back if I'm off the strip again. But I wouldn't go if I were in a hurry and I wouldn't order the Pad Thai. I'd risk getting the Tom Kha again, though!"

I've probably been there at least a half dozen times and I have never had a bad experience. The menu is huge, both in content and weight, and they have a ton of options for omnivores and vegetarians alike. I usually get panang or red curry, but I've heard good things about the sesame beef, Indian curry, and sweet and sour chicken. The pad thai is some of the best I've had in Vegas, and the tom yum and tom kha are equally amazing.  If I had one complaint, the service can be hit or miss. It's never been awful, but it can be a little slow sometimes. However, I am perfectly willing to deal with slowish service if it means eating lots of cheap, delicious food."

            "review": "New favorite Thai spot!\n\nThey have a huge menu (like, literally HUGE - it's made of big, wooden boards) which has a little bit of everything, including several soups and veggie options -- Actually, I would say roughly 60% of the menu is vegetarian/vegan, which is awesome! I love discovering new places that cater to everyone. To be honest, it is kinda pricy, but it's so worth it. There's just so many things to choose from! \n\nMade reservations as a party of 9 for a friend's birthday. Unfortunately, I was a dumbass and had eaten elsewhere not too long beforehand, so I simply went with an $8 pot of hot sake (which is about 6-7 shots) & a plate of fried eggplant -- But don't get me wrong, I def ended up doing a little scavenging off of others' plates: Tom Kha soup w/ scallops, chicken satay, mango sorbet, soft shell crab, and of course the fried eggplant... All of which were DIVINE! Next time, I'll bring an extra stomach and try something new.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a hidden gem. It shares a parking lot with another favorite of mine, Cornish Pasty Co., as well as the infamous Green Door. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but the interior decor is precious. Lots a bright, faux flowers and and gorgeous, wooden tables creates a cozy atmosphere. There isn't a whole lot of elbow room, but I think that just adds to appeal. It's a great place for an intimate dinner with your loved ones. Also, the bathrooms are tucked-away and tidy - which is always a plus.\n\nOn top of all that, service was spectacular! I can't remember their names off the top of my head, but the two women serving us were friendly, quick, and attentive. They really made it an awesome experience. Thank you! I'll be back soon!"

Look for a store front in the middle of a block with a green wall. If you can't spot it, because it is quite small, on the corner of the same block, there is a large rectangular building the has blacked out windows. I think it might be some kind of club. Komol is just a few doors down. On to the review...\n\nI came to Komol because of their vegan-izable menu. They have so many options for veg-heads like myself which was overwhelming because I'm not used to it. Due to my indecision, I went with what the waiter suggested which was the Panang curry. I also got a bowl of rice on the side which was apparently free! \n\nTip: ask for crushed peanuts on the side! They will give you a container of crushed peanuts which is a fantastic addition to any Thai dish. \n\nThey curry was really flavorful and I really liked it. I sprinkled crushed peanuts liberally and it was so good!\n\nOverall, I would come again for the options but it was pricy compared to the other Thai place we went to located in the chinatown area."

I had the chef's special vegetarian curry and it was excellent, with a nice blend of herbs and spices. They have one of the longest vegetarian and vegan menus I've ever seen, but there are also plenty of dishes for carnivores. It's a hidden gem in a mostly vacant shopping center, located less than a mile from the Las Vegas strip."

No Michelin stars, no Food Network stars....just Komol. \n\nThe food here is so dependable and we are all such regulars that the staff is almost like family. \n\nDeliciousness here includes:\n\nTom Kha - the coconut milk-based broth is so rich and flavorful. You can customize the veggies/protein you want added. I like it simple with lots of broth, broccoli, cabbage and straw mushrooms. It's comfort in a bowl\n\nFried Corn - Corn and batter shaped into patties and served with a sweet sauce. Crispy. smooth and delicious. I can't put the experience of eating this dish into words!\n\nPapaya Salad - The papaya salad here is seriously kick-ass. It's got the right balance of sweetness and tartness and it complements the Thai meal beautifully\n\nPad Thai - The Pad Thai here with fried tofu is a tad on the sweet side but I actually like it that way. The noodles are perfectly cooked and mushed together with fresh sprouts, crushed peanuts and the Pad Thai gravy to create an explosion in your mouth\n\nGinger Tofu - Slivered ginger, soft tofu (we ask for soft and not fried), vegetables all tossed in a light black sauce served with crispy Jasmine rice. Oh-so-good for you in all ways!\n\nPanang Curry - The Panang here has a huge following. The curry is extremely rich with the freshly ground spices spewing out of each spoonful. Eating the gravy with rice is an experience to be had\n\nGarlic/Pineapple Fried Rice - Garlic for the spice and savory lover and Pineapple for the sweeter savory dish lover. Both dishes are excellent and really culminate an Asian meal.\n\nKomol is really the place for every lifestyle. With a plant-based menu as well as a meat-based menu you can count on anyone who has a tastebud to be in culinary heaven. \n\nAgain, Komol is is one of the top 5 reasons for me staying in Las Vegas!"

My husbands favorite is the sweet & sour chicken or tofu . Not a big curry eater ... But my sister loves their curry . \nKind of a hard spot to find your first time going . Small little place . Suggest making reservations. Couple times we have just showed up when they had your busses out front & there was over an hour wait .  So of coarse we went elsewhere . \nThe prices are great & food is super tasty . If you have Gluten allergies like me ... They DO have gluten free soy sauce just make sure you request a server who is aware of gluten allergy . We have had a female who was extremely friendly , but got our allergy confused & messed up the order . Not in the best area, but always worth the drive , especially if we are heading out to strip or downtown . Definitely one of the very few places I can go eat with my diet . :)"

Our Las Vegan Eatz club even had a dinner there and the service was outstanding even though there was 50+ of us.\n\nSoy chk nuggets are panko coated and crisp. They are served with a hot mustard and also a sweet and sour.\n\nTom Ka soup is always yum. I like the seaweed soup also. \n\nI am in love with the fragrant herbal salad. It is the most refreshing dish I have ever had. But you really have to be in love with lemongrass.\n\nMy fav dish in the whole world is Pad Kee Mao and they do a pretty good one. I would prefer more basil but it's still yummy.\n\nOf course we always get garlic rice. We sub brown rice and it's always consistent texture and not icky like sometimes brown rice can be.\n\nHubby likes to get Chow Mein or Chow Fun and he likes to add the soy chk. I'm not a fan but it's tender and flavorful.\n\nMy new love is the large appetizer version of their Tom Ya soup. They alter it for me with less vegetables and they add noodles. Wow. \nThe flavors of all the spices are really amazing! I'm sure if you don't want the large hot pot version of it they can just make you a cup. Keep in mind that the Tom Yum on the bottom entree size soup is NOT the same. \n\nThere are many other yummy dishes like Panang Curry, the fried madness of their yummy vegetarian platter, soooooo many more I could write all day!\n\nKomol is an icon in this town and their consistency and fabulous service tells me they will continue to be there for a long long time!"

We also love a good curry and this time we tried the Beef Panang.\n\nWe finished off the meal with a  little desert, something that was new for them to serve tonight, Taro ball in coconut cream.

You know this place is good because they have lots of awards and newspaper clippings on the walls and it is usually crowded. 5 stars for the quality of the food, both vegan and non-vegan. It's my favorite vegan place to visit in Vegas as a non-vegan (makes sense, right?). Actually, my whole family loves this place. The appetizers are reasonably sized and priced. Delicious thai iced tea, and they can make it vegan. The spring rolls, egg rolls, and fried tofu are all great. We always get the pad see ew and it never disappoints. The desserts we've had, coffee and thai iced tea ice cream, were delicious. I tried the homemade coconut ice cream with sweet sticky rice this past visit. It was definitely a new type of dessert for me, but I liked it. The coconut ice cream was very light and airy.

After checking out the location and look of the restaurant from the outside, we almost went back, though I am glad we didn't! The food is fantastic!!! We absolutely loved their Panang curry. It is the best we have had in the US. We also had Chili Mint, which was quite decent as well. The rice portions are quite generous, and the service was super-friendly. When we asked for a to-go box for our leftovers, the lady not only gave us extra rice, but also 2 plates and cutlery with our to-go box!!! If I could go to one restaurant in Las Vegas, this would be it!!"

This place looks nice on the inside...\n\nMade a reso for a party of 12, waited 10 minutes after arriving while they got the tables ready, which should've already been ready for us. -_-\nIt's understandable that it took awhile for our orders to come out since we had such a large group, but it\nTook the servers about 10 minutes before asking for our orders.\nOne order didn't come out until AFTER everyone else in the party had FINISHED EATING. \nThis is after we bugged the servers every chance we got to ask if my friend's food would be coming out soon.\nThe rest of us felt bad about starting to eat before he had his food, but we had no choice as we were on a tight schedule and were already running late. (Good thing he's a fast eater) \nWeird thing is, another person in our group ordered the exact same thing, only a slightly lower level of spiciness.   \n\nThe food was okay. We had to stay vigilant on when servers would pass by in order to get their attention for more water, lemon, etc. Poor guys, but i think they should have tended to us a little more often than they actually did.  \n\nTo top it off, the check came with a total of $170!!!!!!!!!!! (including 18% gratuity which was calculated from the total+tax, which is WRONG). This doesn't make sense AT ALL because 4 of the 12 in our party had their own plates, while the other 8 shared with a partner. \nThey obviously don't know how to do simple arithmetic here, and somehow they stapled some other bill on top of ours and added it together... (we knew those weren't what we ordered)\n\nSo we calculated our correct bill ourselves and talked to the manager about it. Our actual bill was only about $109 total. \n\nNEVER again will i eat here.\n\nLast note, the food didn't sit well with one of my friends. He got really sick, had a rough night, fever, and threw up quite a bit throughout the remainder of the next day until we got home to San Diego :("

The fruits/veggies in it were crisp and it had such a refreshing taste - it tied with the panang curry for my favorite dish on the table.  The garlic eggplant was also good but the flavor in both the herbal salad and the panang curry could not be beat.  Looking forward to going back!"

Service was slow and impersonal. In their defense, it seems like they have two servers to wait on and bus the entire restaurant and they were fairly busy tonight. \n\nFood - Tom yum soup was ok (kind of hard to screw up). I ordered some fried squid which was hard and tasteless and the sauces seemed off. The waitress took that off our bill when I asked her to take it away after barely eating any. Sea bass with ginger sauce was decent, not great. \n\nMy friend ordered the fresh spring rolls and veggie delight, which were both a little better than my food (we shared), though those seemed more along the lines of Chinese-American dishes than Thai food. Maybe I ordered the wrong things or it's mainly geared towards the vegetarian food, but I thought everything about the place was pretty mediocre. They do have a large vegetarian section in an already large menu, but it's not that hard to find good vegetarian friendly meals in any Thai restaurant.\n\nI love Thai food, but I can't see myself coming back here. The food tastes more like an average Chinese restaurant than a real Thai place. It wasn't too expensive fortunately - about $55 for one appetizer, a cup of soup, two entrees, and two beers, plus tip."

Then I told my waiter to give me a level 5 heat rating.\n\nWhile the soup didn't really impress me, I thought, overall...not bad. The chicken panang was awesome and was perfectly balanced by the steamed rice. The heat rating was also right on point. Bravo!\n\nWould I chose Komol over Lotus any day?

Now, we go about once a month with our veggie friends and have not yet had anything that has disappointed.  My meal always starts with the cold papaya salad (fresh, slim-cut papaya with finely chopped green chilis,  some salt and pepper to taste and a dash of lime juice - YUM and so fresh), and the tom kha soup.  Where it goes from there is anyone's guess... but it never disappoints.  My newest favorite: the sauteed flat noodles with faux duck.

It was missing this quality that I can't put my finger on that I had in all the dishes when I was in Thailand. Thai food in America is all very saucy, pungent, and overpowering -- which, don't get me wrong, can be INCREDIBLE sometimes. But the beauty of the Thai food in Thailand is that it's not very saucy, pungent, and overpowering, but still maintains this tastiness that I've never experienced in America.\n\nUntil now. \n\nKomol Restaurant is the most authentic Thai restaurant that I've ever had in America. \n\nJust take their Pad Thai for example -- it's probably less saucy and orange-colored than you're used to. The Pad Thai flavor isn't as strong, but for some reason, each bite releases a delicious taste that isn't like the overpowering and sweet Pad Thai that you're used to in America. Even the Pad See Ewe, which is usually dark brown because of the overuse of soy sauce, has a lighter hue at Komol, but still packs in all of the unique flavor that Pad See Ewe should have.\n\nThe Herbal Salad, which is highly reviewed on Yelp, was good, but a little too pungent. It's like your typical Rainbow or Tea Leaf Salad at your local Burmese joint, but with way too many overpowering flavors.\n\nThe curries (Panang and Masamun) are both delicious, but these are more standard tastes that are pretty much the same in Thailand and in America.\n\nAlso, they make an excellent Thai iced tea.\n\nI don't want to sound like a Thai food snob or connoisseur. It's very likely that I have no idea what I'm talking about. But I love Thai food and I love the Thai food I had when I was in Thailand. I'm not a professional -- just speaking from personal experience, and this is what I know to be true for myself. What I know to be true now is that you're not going to get a more authentic Thai food experience than at Komol."

It's a really nice little place with a good atmosphere.\n\nWe started off with the stuffed chicken wings. They were good, but mostly they were just interesting. I'm not sure I would ever order them again, but I'm glad I tried them.\n\nWe then shared the hot and spicy pork hock curry and beef chili mint. To be honest, neither were what we expected - though, that was certainly not a bad thing. \n\nI typically do not enjoy curry dishes, but this particular curry dish was incredibly delicious. The beef chili mint was also fantastic.\n\nWhen you order, you can choose on a scale of 1-10 of how spicy you want the dishes. My husband and I both opted for a 6. And while we both tend to find things others describe as \"hot\" to be merely \"mild\", the dishes were almost too spicy - but in that good way.\n\nWe then finished it all off with a dessert of fried bananas with coconut ice cream.\n\nAll in all, it was a delicious meal. To be honest, I think I actually prefer Komol to Lotus of Siam. And the service was excellent - up until it came time to pay the bill anyways.\n\nWhen we handed our server the restaurant.com gift certificate, he set it back on the table and said \"we don't take these anymore\". Uh, what? We purchased it. We purchased it for this restaurant. And it doesn't expire. But ok, fine. We asked a couple of questions about it as we were clearly taken by surprise, but didn't really get anywhere. \n\nI suppose I can understand, but - and maybe this is just me having lived in Vegas too long - what irked me the most was that there was nothing done about it.

We had the Tom Kha Kai, Panang with beef, Pad See Ew, and mint chicken.  All around, this was an excellent meal, with surprisingly high quality and fresh ingredients!  The freshness of the ingredients is one of my favorite things about this place.\n\nThe Tom Kha Kai was excellent.  It was perfectly thick and flavorful.  It didn't have the lime taste that most Tom Kha Kai's have, but only a hint of it.  This was ok though because the quality of the soup was fabulous!  \n\nThe Pad See Ew was probably my least favorite of the dishes.  I have had better versions of this at a couple of other Thai restaurants.  Still, the freshness of the Chinese broccoli was amazing!  Just like my first visit, they give you big chunks of broccoli, fresh and crisp like it was bought the same day.  The noodles could have been a little bit better; there wasn't an impressive flavor to them, but enough to make it an appetizing dish.\n\nI really loved the Panang Curry with beef, combined with the mint chicken over very nice, fluffy white rice.  This was recommended by the young man who served us, and he was spot on!  The curry was thick, which is a style I tend not to like because a lot of places make it too sweet.  This curry was awesome though, not sweet and full of interesting flavors.  The beef was excellently prepared, perhaps even a stewed beef.  With a little bit of this curry over rice and some of the mint chicken, I was thoroughly impressed.  \n\nWhat really makes Komol such a great restaurant isn't their unique recipes, but their unique ability to use high quality ingredients.  I am giving them 4 stars now for this, and moving Komol to my Best Thai in Vegas List!  I would take this place over the other Thai restaurant that sits in the same shopping center any day!  Things that could improve: the Thai Iced Tea, better filtered water, and the green curry is a little bland."

Why wait an hour at the popular lotus siam next door when you can come here? Great food for reasonable prices and excellent service. They even called a cab for us to get back to our hotel. Highly recommend this little gem. We'll be back."

The experience was not bad, nor was it memorable. Since I have become savvy of its clout among locals, I ventured back there and - outside of the herbal salad - I was similarly underwhelmed. We had a sampling of four dishes and - the aforementioned glorious herbal salad excluded - nothing really stood out. It was all decent Thai food, but nothing more. And while it gets bonus points for that herbal salad, it certainly gets docked for the molasses service and (to a lesser extent) whatever it is that they call merlot in this joint (I know, what do I expect when ordering wine in a hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant). With Lotus of Siam in the same parking lot, I do not see myself coming back to Komol.\n\nSide Note: I get hit up for change at a ridiculous clip in this parking lot when I visit Lotus. At Komol, I was able to park directly in front of the restaurant. Instantly I thought, \"Well, at least I will not be hit up for change.\" Then, hilariously, I take two steps from my car and a dude asks if he can watch my car in exchange for some dough. It was like he appeared out of thin air! If mooching were a sport, the world championships would definitely be held in this parking lot."

As a person that enjoys meat, I did not miss it one bit when it came to Komol.\n\nThe Vegetarian Platter: was a bountiful fest of lightly battered fried spinach, sweet potatoes, eggplant, and tofu. It reaffirms that you can fry anything and it would be amazing.\n\nThe Chicken Noodle Soup: was just that. Nothing special, but it was welcomed on this cold day. No I am not talking about my experience on the date right now.\n\nThe Herbal Salad: was everything everyone raves about and more. I loved the crispy fried tofu skins mixed in to give it more texture. The dish does not lack in that department or in flavor.\n\nThe Vegetarian Delight Curry: was good. The eggplants, green beans, and tofu in a rich broth could have used more of a kick. We ordered it mild in case they actually went Asian hot on us. Instead it was definitely not made for someone who likes a kick.\n\nThere was just so much food in the end.

Komol is a Thai restaurant in the same shopping center as lotus of Siam. It's highly regarded as one of the better vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Las Vegas, but we got meat dishes and generally they were quite good.\nWe started with an egg roll or whatever they called it. It was deep fried but may not have contained egg. Nice and crispy on the outside and good flavor on the inside. Next up was the chicken coconut soup. This is always so different in so many restaurants. There was lots of spicy red powder floating at the top of this soup. They're pretty serious about the zing here at Komol. I can't really rank it among my chicken coconut soups. It might be near the top. I have to have it again.\nThen came the beef salad, which for me was the only disappointment of the night. While the beef was tasty, several pieces were really tough to chew. The tomatoes also seemed like the supermarket tomatoes that ripen on the truck on the way to delivery. \nThe two entrees we split were both excellent. I ordered the mixed seafood in panang curry and it was all good. All the seafood seemed fresh and was not overcooked. The curry had great flavor and precision. Ted ordered the beef basil in a brown rice and it was also nicely done with a great mix of flavors. \nCorkage was $5 a bottle."

Komol is in the center of the parking area for the entire strip mall and is easy to miss if you are not looking for it. \n\nHaving walked down near here to visit another location on a Sunday, I already knew LoS was closed for lunch and yet I wanted more Thai.  Yelp came to the rescue and delivered me to another outstanding Thai restaurant!  I could hardly believe that two of the best Thai establishments I've eaten at in the US are in the same location!  Hmm.. maybe its the location - what looks to be 40 year old, barely maintained strip mall not terribly far off the far end of the Las Vegas strip. \n\nI agree with another reviewer, its hard to believe both LoS and Komol are within eye-shot of each other..Karma anyone? \n\nAs I mentioned in my LoS review, this is too far to walk for 99.9% of the Strip crowd, so be prepared to take the bus or a cab.  You can get here on the bus w/ a single transfer and then only have to walk a short distance across mostly parking lot to reach Komol.  \n\nThe interior is nicely decorated and they have many of the awards they have won clearly posted near the entrance.  I was so glad to get out of the afternoon Vegas heat and it was plenty cool inside.  I immediately ordered a Thai Iced Tea and water, water, water.    The wait staff was very attentive as I had 3 Thai Iced Teas before I left but I'll get to that and lost count on the water refills - that dry Vegas air is tough. \n\nAfter scanning the huge and varied menu, I must say I was overwhelmed with the choices and options and it took me a while to decide.  However the Chief's special looked right for me as I honed in.  It is a blend of spicy herbal curry sauteed with string beans, carrots, bell peppers and basil leavers.  I omitted the bell peppers and asked for an \"8/10\" on the heat scale. \n\nThe dish arrived promptly and I took my first bite - wonderful but then the heat kicked in and well as another reviewer said, beware of the pepper scale.   Normally, I can eat all but the extreme 10/10 Thai hot levels but 8 was too much for me on this dish .  There is NO WAY I could have eaten it without the cream in the Thai Iced tea to calm the heat!  I asked the waitress about the \"8\" rating and she said that dish was normally hot b/c of the chili peppers already in there, she had recommended milder for most customers.  \n\nIt was good, but damn was it hot!   I highly recommend scaling back on your normal heat rating scale or be prepared for a hot but delicious ride here!   You can always turn up the heat after the dish arrives! \n\nIf you love Thai food, then you have 2 great locations in the same strip mall and honestly, you cannot go wrong at either one..  Give Komol a try and you will be rewarded with a Thai meal you won't soon forget and be glad you took that ride!\n\nDid I mention they cater to vegetarians as well!"

This was crisp, fresh and different (the good/refreshing different, not the searching for a modifier different.)  We were fans of the Salad, the lemongrass, fresh herbs and fried tofu.   Spice level was 5/10 and played nice with the acidity of the salad.  My point?...you should order this salad.\n\nWe also ordered Pork Pad Kee Mao and Veggie Panang Curry--wish I had read Cathy C's review that you can ask for items a little hotter here than you might at other Thai Restaurants.  The curry was a little thicker than usual...nice texture, felt a little love put into it...anytime you feel a little of the love that goes in to something that's good right?...yeah, it is!  The Pad Kee Mao was a little less flavorful than the other items, but this was the only dish we ordered mild...don't be like us...get them all at or near your maximum heat level!...added some chili flake and pepper sauce afterwards and was much better--not just heat wise, but for another level of flavor.  They do a great job here with their Pad Thai as well.\n\nThe restaurant itself is rather nice inside.  You can easily forget that you are in commercial center.  We also appreciated the signs on restrooms.  A heart of the lades chest (assuming because women love with their hearts) and a heart over the males gentiles (assuming because men love with their...,) nice and direct?...I liked it.\n\nI have long since stopped trying to find the best Thai in Vegas.  There is a different favorite for each Thai dish that I typically get.  I would definitely come here before I would go to any hyper popular Thai spot in the same center!  Additionally though Komol has earned a spot with me for their Herbal Salad."

It's usually full, but no lines like LoS.  The vegetables are fresh, the spices--especially curry--must be something homemade instead of packaged, because they're distinct and uniquely rich.  We've been known to go here several days a week, because there's so much to try, and we have so many favorites, it really never gets old.\n\nIf you like curry, you really MUST try their Panang. It's unreal.\nAlso a consistent hit with us is the Pad See Ew--it must have freshly made noodles, because it's truly addictive."

When I lived in Vegas, this was a favorite of mine and my best friend, who agreed that this is the best Thai food in Vegas. \n\nBad art, bad decor, Commercial Center... those would not be things that would draw me into a place. The service is impeccable and the food is awesome. My friend lived in Thailand during all of her high school years so if she says it's the real thing, then it's the real thing. \n\nI had the papaya salad which was truly excellent. When he asked me for my \"spicy\" level, I said medium. Both he and my friend looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears (sound familiar), and he responded with oh no, give me a number from 1-10. So, I asked for a 3. Well, it wasn't quite spicy enough for me so I added a little of my own. \n\nI have noticed in Thai restaurants, that most of them think we can't handle the level of heat they can. Well that may be true because it can be too hot for me but I think I could have handled at least a 5. No worries because the papaya salad was excellent. \n\nIf you can get past the bad art, the bad decor, and bad everything else here (that does not include the food or the service), then I highly recommend you try this place. You won't regret it."

This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!\n\nI had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.\n\nWhen we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously. \n\nFood wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that. The spice level that we asked for in each dish was exactly on point, something that has never happened to me except at LoS. That says a lot.\n\nHerbal Salad - believe the hype, for it is real. This is a *must order* item! I don't know if this their signature dish, but it should be. It's a very unassuming plate.. but aren't a lot of great dishes the same way? After taking in that first spoon, it was love at first bite. The textures were amazing. Apples, crunchy tofu, lemongrass, and much, much more. I'll leave it to you guys who've never tried it, to experience it for yourselves. You won't regret it.\n\nDrunken noodles - they killed it here as well. I was mystified how they were able to add all that flavor into each rice noodle. It's pretty crazy. It was as if the sauce and spices were made into the noodles. A stunner!\n\nMango sticky rice - the mango was perfectly ripe, and tasted how a real mango should taste like. The sticky rice was sticky-icky! It also wasn't cloyingly sweet, and complimented the mango brilliantly. Another winner!\n\nThe panang curry and tom yum soup were excellent and items that I would highly recommend!\n\nBut, like in many operations, service kind of destroyed a great meal. Our server was gracious, kind, and helpful. But asking two servers to run a full restaurant, taking orders, running their food, and bussing their tables is just asinine. I know that the business is trying to cut costs, but as the great Chris Carter says \"C'mon, man!\"\n\nService aside, I would happily come back here because the food is that good. I shall see you on that flip side!"

The chicken was minced/ground which was a bit unusual from what I am used to. The flavor was fine and the ingredients were quality, but it was not amazing nor did it warrant rushing back there. \nI decided I would try this place again before I wrote a review. A week or so ago, I went back because I was in the field and was in the nearby area. I met another friend for lunch and we gave their lunch special a try. I had their panang curry lunch special that came with an eggroll, rice and a soup of the day for $7.95. The soup was pretty bland with vegetable and tofu. The curry was fine, but not unlike Panang curry I have tried at plenty of other Thai joints. I had spicy 7/10 and I'd say to me more realistically it was like a 5/10.\n The service was very spotty and inconsistent. You can tell the wait staff started to get overwhelmed when the lunch rush hour began. But to be fair, they were pretty slow when it was just two tables in the joint.. The restaurant appears clean with interesting traditional Thai decor. The menu's have wooden covers which is a cool touch. I would probably try this place again if in the area and craving Thai, but I wouldn't drive here from home. This is a perfect example of a place being hyped up."

My interest peaked when I noticed that this restaurant was participating in the Restaurant.com certificate program. Also a participant in the 2010 Entertainment Book. Located in the Commercial Center, in between a Mexican restaurant and a Japanese restaurant. \n\nThe interior looked different than what I remember. I like the semi-private alcoves (booths- ok a little weird, because my feet were off the floor and if I were a bigger person, might be a little uncomfortable; the table was very close to the booth- just saying. My husband's feet were almost off the floor) with the pretty artificial floral arrangements. We were seated in one corner of the room. There was a banana plant situated in the middle of the floral arrangement- my husband said it was funny and when I looked at it, I noticed there was a sign \"Please don't touch.\" Aside from that, much better ambiance here, as compared to other Thai restaurants. \n\nThe menus are wooden which make it really heavy- you could knock someone upside the head and knock him/her out- seriously. Pretty large menu- including vegetarian selections, family dinners (highest being $31.95 for two people with several courses), and lunch specials (only mon-fri). Drinks were soda, hot tea, thai iced tea, and perrier. \n\nThere were two other parties besides us. I don't know if this was typical of a sunday afternoon for lunch. The host and server were very nice. The server's uncle is the owner of the restaurant. He shared with us that this restaurant was the second Thai restaurant to open in Las Vegas. \n\nWe ordered the spring rolls (one order is comprised of two), chicken curry dish with potatoes (with steamed rice) and combination (pork, chicken, beef, and shrimp) thai style fried rice. The spring rolls were crispy and came with two sauces. The chicken curry dish was fragrant (mmm) and was served in a large blue and white bowl; came with a bowl of white rice. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender- excellent. It was a good size but there could have been more potatoes. My husband loves the sauce, but we had to get it mild because my husband's spice meter is pretty low (I like medium-hot). The thai style fried rice was huge. I like the fried egg, the cucumbers, and the tomatoes- really sets it apart from Chinese fried rice. Good flavor- sweeter than Chinese fried rice. We had leftovers. My husband said we found our replacement for the Mix Zone Cafe ( we all got sick on our last visit). The bill came to a little over $14 using the coupon from the Entertainment Book."

            "review": "Shoutout to Lisa L and Eric R for dragging my husband and I to this place (and bringing a killer coupon no less). I had always been scared of this place due to all the vegetarian verbage that gets thrown around. Luckily their meat dishes are outstanding as well! \n\nLisa L's description of the food was spot on. Everthing was quite tasty. Service was pretty spotty, but no major complaints there. Beer was reasonable and varied ($4 for chinese/thai imports, $3.50 for American beers) and overall the dinner was an insane value. With the coupon we spent $12.50 each for our 4 course meal + dessert + drinks. Without the coupon we still would have spent a meager $18.50 (with tax and tip!) each for that feast. Killer. \n\nNow for a little comparison amongst Komol and LOS for the die hard foodies who can't decide which to go to (Pin Kao doesn't come close to measuring up to either one!). \nGot Vegan/Veggie people with you? Definitely Komol, no question\nValue oriented? Komol\nLooking to eat the basics (ie curry, pad see ew, etc): Komol\n\nSo why should anyone ever go to LOS? LOS is really for a more sophisticated palate. The food is infinitely more interesting ! The drunken seabass noodles (not found at Komol) and the soft shell prawns (not found at Komol) are my two favorites. Komol was great, but comparing LOS and Komol is kind of ridiculous. It's like comparing Mon Ami Gabi to Joel Robuchon. Both are French, but the food is just so completely different. \n\nHonestly it just depends if you're looking to try Thai like you've never had it, or are you looking for the basics done well at a great price. Komol serves the later."

            "review": "Honestly I would expect more out of such a highly rated restaurant AND a Zagat restaurant as well. I think the night we came was jinxed or something because my experience here for a friend's birthday was not terribly good.\n\nFor starters we had a party of 6, which increased to 7 unexpectedly, but it was fine, we all just squished a bit closer to each other. The restaurant did have a table set up for our reservation when we arrived, so that was a good start. The ambiance of the restaurant is relaxing and the noise level while we were there was perfect. In fact, I think we were probably the loudest out of the whole place.\n\nService - It was all over the place. We had two people taking our orders and I think that is where things got weird. We had a friend who came, but needed to leave early so she ordered her food before the rest of our part had even arrived AND she ordered it to go. Somehow between our two servers that was turned into \"She wants an order of shrimp chow mein AND an order of shrimp chow mein TO GO\". Luckily we were able to nip this mistake before it actually happened. And although our servers were attentive, the service was S-L-O-W. As in plates of food came out one or two at a time and there was big chunks of wait time in between people's food arriving. It's one of my biggest pet peeves when a restaurant cannot get a whole party's food out in a decent amount of time. Members of our party sat without food for a good 7 to 8 minutes while others were almost halfway through their own plates. \n\nFood - I had the Kang-Ped Delight with Beef (err, actually with 5 pieces of beef). Although it was really good, I did enjoy it, I was missing the beef! The curry was spot on and their rice was sticky yummy. As always I also had a Thai iced tea and theirs is spot on. Creamy and milky, yet refreshing and served in a very cute glass. I also sampled from the \"Combo Appetizer Plate\" that our group got. I had the BBQ pork, very good; and an egg roll - also good, especially dipped in spicy mustard! We all also shared the fried eggplant, which I felt was okay, nothing special. The ice cream served for my friend's birthday was kind of funky, and I felt as though it was freezer burned. Meh. \n\nOverall - Honest to goodness I don't think I'll be coming back. The lackadaisical service to my friend's birthday party was pretty off-putting. Maybe they're just not good with big groups? I have no idea. BUT I can get Thai food at a lot of places in Vegas closer to my house. So, unless I'm *invited* to Komol again I doubt I will return."

We always go during lunch when its near empty and get waited on hand and foot. The waitstaff talks to us like we're friends, not customers. \n\nWe always order panang. The panang is, as my friend puts it, \"to die for.\" She gets chicken panang, I get the tofu panang. Either way, all you're really going for is the sauce. One day we'll grow the balls to just ask for panang sauce and a couple straws. \n\nWe also order tom yum to start, nam tok (beef salad), and I get my standard green curry and sticky rice. Green curry is my favorite Thai dish ever, but Komol's is pretty lackluster. But everything else is always really good. My friend told me you're supposed to make little balls with the sticky rice and sop up the juices. \n\nThe last time I went they were pushing Moonstone Coconut Lemongrass sake. They sell it $7.50 for a half bottle. It tastes mostly like coconut milk + nigori sake. The lemongrass, I caught more aromatically and at the end of the taste. It was really good. \n\nKomol is located in the Commercial Center, sparsely populated with small businesses, including an Asian (Korean) market. I go there for some dessert mochi.\n\n* off the strip, non-casino"

They used to deliver to my work, so I ate their food frequently. The last few times I've been there I have noticed the food isn't as good as it used to be. \n\nWe went there last night, had a reservation, when we arrived the employees were running around like crazy. The place was busy, but not anything crazier than I've seen it before. \n\nWe are seated and wait for awhile for someone to take our orders. She finally comes and we are both famished. Had we known what was about to transpire, we would've ordered our entrees. So we eat our salad, and she comes to take out entree order. We waited ONE HOUR for our food to arrive. I was so hungry I was close to walking out. Then, my entree arrives. Mine only. The waitress leaves the table. Doesn't say a word about my friends dish. I sit patiently staring at my food. We call her over to see what's going on and she says \"it will be out soon\". So I'm sitting there patiently for my friends food to arrive, where I come from it's rude to eat without everyone having their entree. Ten minutes later it arrives. My Pad Kee Mao was less than stellar. I ate the shrimp out of it and left everything else. Needless to say, I won't be going back."

Plenty of parking and never too crowded.  \n\nA.  Service - The staff is pretty attentive and you can get seated immediately.  Coming in at 2:00 pm on a Sunday, there were 8 of us and we were seated in minutes. There was another large table of people half way eating and then tables of 3-4 people were scattered.  Immediately after we were seated, two other smaller parties came in and were seated.\n\nB.  The Wait - It took us about 45 minutes to get our food and then when it came, it took another 10 minutes for everyone to get their orders. We ordered individually.  The reason given was that the three parties came in at the same time. I am not sure what you do in this case, but I would not make people wait so long. I would give them some free appetizers, or snack food or something to keep them going. \n\nC.  No Wings - WE ordered individually and even ordered two orders of wings for the table.  Never got the wings, as an appetizer or as a main meal.  That was odd. We had to advise the server and their response was that they would remove it from the check. No options here.\n\nD.  The Food - This is where it is great.\n\nSukiyuki Thai Style - I wasn't too hungry and this soup was pretty tasty. I ordered it hot and it was very mild.  Good amount of seafood.\n\nGarlic Soft Shell Crab - Wow, what a nice tasty dish.\n\nBeef and Bok Choy- OK, doesn't sound to Thai, but that is what the daughter ordered. I thought it was cooked good!\n\nMassaman Curry - The wife ordered this and loved it.  Beef is normal for Massaman and it did not disappoint.\n\nPad Thai - Huge plate with plenty of the good stuff.\n\nFried Rice - Another huge plate. But we polished this off for some reason.\n\nThe Food is very, very good.  It is worth it.\n\nGenerally, the service is good, but not very professional. One time I came in and they were busy so the Tom Yum soup was served in a soup bowl and not the hot charcoal cooker it should be.  that affects the ambiance and the atmosphere as well as the hot taste!\n\nI like this place and will come back.  Especially important when Lotus of Siam is overly crowded or closed until 5:00 pm on Sundays.\n\nGK says, be prepared, but the food is darn good."

And their Panang Curry over some rice is a must.  \n\nJust make sure to inform your server how hot or mild you want your food.  On this occasion we were informed that even their mild was a little too hot due to the pepper season and location they receive their peppers from today. \n\nThe service we received was really spot on and for this all of the above, I am a fan."

My boyfriend and I had wrote down the address as a place to go in Las Vegas, and when the GPS brought us here, we almost didn't get out of the car!  The strip mall is shady looking, but have no fear, the food is amazing!  The staff was helpful, and the service was prompt.  If I lived in Las Vegas, I think I would become a regular here.

Ordered Pad Thai with shrimp, soft shell crab and pad kee Mao.\nTook one bite of pad Thai and it pisses me off. They can't even do such a simple generic Thai dish right! Soft shell crab is super oily and tasteless, don't know why they put it on the menu board? The pad kee Mao is oily but tasty. I will not be going back. To be considered in my book of good eats, the restaurant needs to be consistently good every time I visit. This is not such a restaurant. Maybe we went on a day when the chef is depressed... Lotus of Siam is way better."

Once inside, we found a small jam packed restaurant and had to wait for about 20 minutes before we were seated. The food was good, but I wasn't extremely impressed. I might be biased because we have amazing thai food in LA. I loved the fact that it wasn't on the strip and the prices were reasonable, and the portions generous. However, the overall quality didn't compete with the Thai food I am used to back home....."

Something about that made me want to try the curry, even though I was expecting to hate it.  But, alas, I liked this curry!

I love that when you order HOT it will definitely be HOT so if you don't like spicey go with mild because you can always ask for side spices. Some of their vegetarian dishes are so amazing that you would never even miss having the meat in it. I love the shrimp salad, papaya salad and the herbal salad. All the curries are delishes, the chili mint is to die for, and any of there noodle dishes taste so different and made with love. It's a smaller restaurant so I would recommend reservations, or call at least 40 minutes ahead for take out orders, but well worth the wait and freshness. This restaurant is definitely better than any of the neighboring restaurants regardless of what the buzz around town is. It's all about Komol."

Delicious, but careful.

It was also pretty busy for lunch! Long time no see Komol!\n\n BOMB BITES:\n\nOne of my favorite salads in town is their Herbal Salad, so we ordered that and since it was a bit chilly, a bowl of Tom Kha(spice level 1) also sounded great.  Our food didn't take too long because all we ordered was a soup and salad, but the soup came first. It was good, but  boy did it pack some HEAT!?!? Aside from the heat,  the dominant flavors were coconut, lime, and fish sauce. I prefer to make my Tom Kha with a little more aromatic flavors (more lemongrass, kafir lime leaf, and galangal) which was barely evident, but still good. The herbal salad arrives and we dig in. All these memorable flavors are what made me a fan in the first place. All of the fruits,  veggies, tofu, cashews, and aromatics. Mysteriously, our mouths started heating up again!? A few seconds later, we discover that the same dried chili that was in our soup also made its way into the salad. Although we enjoyed our meal, our tastebuds were ON FIYAH! Out of curiosity, we asked our waiter if chili is usually in the Herbal Salad. He said not normally...feeling bad, he brought us some rice to hopefully tame the heat in our soup and that secret sauce that goes in the Herbal Salad to tame the heat in the salad. What service!\n\nCLOSING STATEMENTS:\n\nNow everyone who frequents Thai restaurants are familiar with the Thai Spice number system with 1 being the most mild (yeah right!) and 10 being \"you so crazy!?\" hot...just be forewarned that unless you love spicy, even level one packs a punch! One of the ladies from the kitchen came out explained that it was also the season for the chilies from Fresno that they use which meant that they are more potent than usual. She thanked us for coming in and sent us off with another Herbal Salad with no chili. :)  ALOHA!!!\n\n\nShaka Meter: \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  5\n\nWill I Return???  Yup!"

The heavy wood-bound menus are a nice touch.\n\nGet the Thai iced coffee or tea. Service is ususlly on the slow side, so I  always start with a  Tom Kha or Tom Yum small soup  (good opportunity to go vegetarian even if you go with meat for the entree).  The curries are great for sharing. The noodle dishes are very good. I like that they organize the entrees by type of meat.  Lots of interesting seafood items.\n\nOverall, it's hard to recommend anyone drive across town for the experience, but it's a lot easier to get into than Lotus of Siam, in the same parking lot, and it's a good place to start a night downtown, or near the strip. We usually stop in before we see a show at the Onyx Theater."

Either way, I got over it and ate with \"regular rice\" which was fine....I had the panang chicken curry which was good, i usually get yellow chicken curry but my wife pushed me outside the box, and I tried the red.  I would go back here, service was good, although we ate around 5pm on a weeknight and we were the only ones there."

This place was seriously in my top 10 favorite restaurants but after the last two visits it's not even close to the quality of food I use to enjoy.\n\nThe last two visits the food was overly salty and my boyfriends dish was overly garlicky. When we asked the server to recommend an appetizer we took her advice and got these deep fried shrimp rolls. They were completely tasteless.\n\nThis all depresses me but I don't know if I'll ever come back if the quality of the food remains this way."

They were not over cooked and the sauce was perfect blend of coconut and panang sauce. There were only 3 shrimps in the plate though, although they only charged $2 for the shrimp. The fried Talapia was ordered with their garlic sauce. Tons of garlic. If you don't like whole fishes then don't order this. My significant other cannot handle seeing fish head etc so we asked them to take the head off when serving the fish. I love the skin since it is kind of like eating fried chicken. The fried tofu was also really good for $4, they gave us tons of tofu and the peanut sauce was also really good. The soup was also great. \n\n\nQUANTITY\n\nRead good sized portions for the price.\n\nSERVICE\n\nVery friendly and kept as informed the whole time what was going on with our food. The appetizer and the soup showed up relatively fast\n\nRETURN BUSINESS\n\n4 sure. But if Little Siam is open it is gonna be a tough call."

Its in the Commercial Center close to Lotus of Siam, which itself was named \"Best Thai Restaurant\" by Gourmet Magazine I believe it was. However, I prefer Komol.\n\nTheir lunch specials are one of the best deals in town, but, the food is really what makes it great. I suggest the Chili Mint... anything really,but, pork and chicken are the best! Every curry dish I had was delicious too. If you like duck i would recommend the Pineapple Duck. Larb and Pad See Ew are off-the-hook also.\n\n My old roomie was a vegan and everything I tried that he got like the Orange Peel Gluten, was awesome. Also make sure to get their Brown sticky rice, its the bomb. \n\nOh my god I'm hungry now."

The summer rolls were pretty good. The peanut sauce along with the chili vinegar sauce was spot on and complimented the rolls well. ORDER THE CHOW FUN. I love chow fun, and so we ordered it and it was a great dish: I literally can't explain how great it was. The pad thai: I personally love pad thai, but this one was a little greasy.\n\nThe reason this got 3 stars was because the service STINKS. We got our drinks, and it took about half an hour to get an appetizer out. Half an hour. It was ridiculous. Also, one of the waitresses had an attitude problem when we asked when and where our food was and when it was coming. We ended up getting everything, altogether, an hour later.

So many great sounding choices.  It was hard to narrow entrees down but it had already been decided pre-arrival that the herbal salad was a must order appetizer.  Thanks Lisa R for the raving about it.  What a tasty, crazy mix of stuff.  The #7 spice was a little over the top as it set my tongue ablaze but was a good burn for the wife.  I don't know what happened to my relationship with spicy food but it has cooled off considerably the last few years.  I guess I'm getting old.  I would've ordered a 10 spice a long time ago. \n\nI was worried since we ordered our curries with #7 spice thinking I would need to ask for a fire extinguisher.  I asked the waiter if I could get a 4 or 5 for the Kang-Ped Delight I ordered.  He said \"No problem\" but the only problem was that the server had our curries right behind him!  Thankfully the coconut milk made it taste like a 5.\n\nThe Kang-Ped Delight certainly was all that!  The curry had bamboo shoots, tofu, zucchini, baby corn, straw mushrooms, snow peas, carrots and hot peppers, cooked in red curry sauce with coconut milk.  It was probably the best Thai curry I've had in recent memory.  I added soy chicken for $2 and it made this killer.  The best fake chicken I've ever tasted.  How did they do it?  I can't wait to try their soy duck and shrimp on future visits."

Either the flavors are lacking dimension, or the spice is haphazardly hot, or the temperature of the food is just not hot - almost as if they my dish sit for 10 mins or more until the entire party's order is ready to send out. This is so 1950s. I believe hot food should be eaten. If it's cold - hold.\n\nService here can be less than attentive - our party's water glasses are usually less than half full, and at least half the time either the wrong (white) rice comes out or it takes another 3 or 4 minutes to receive a small bowl to eat out of.\n\nTo be fair, the average dish at Komol is superior to the average small/midsize town Thai restaurant. It's the execution that is missing. The plates, glassware, silverware, plastic floral decor, and bathrooms are less than spotless. The vinyl-padded, low booths are a little claustrophobic. Once you're done eating you feel like getting the heck out of there.\n\nIt's not *cheap* either - not expensive, but not as good of a value compared to say, Weera Thai or Kinnaree Thai. I do look forward to trying the Pasty shop next door!"

Luckily one of them let us know exactly where it was because other mentions about it being hard to find are spot on. Instead of driving around commercial center, just go straight to the middle building there and the restaurant entrance faces West. It looks kinda small from the outside but it's a good size restaurant and they seem to keep it very clean...that's always a plus!\n\nNow on to what's not small...the menu! They have a pretty extensive menu that comes in the form of a book that weighs about 5 pounds! We got a few things to share between all of us, starting with the herbal salad, tod mun & fresh spring rolls. The herbal salad is a must try dish! I'm not even a huge fan of tofu but they fry it up and toss it with a few things like lemongrass, apples, onions & cashews. It is by far one of the freshest tasting dishes I've ever had and packed with awesome flavor and texture. The fresh spring rolls were also really good and come with a delicious peanut sauce. I wasn't a fan of the tod mun...the corn was so overpowering that I didn't taste fish at all. \n\nWe also got a few entr\u00e9es...chicken chow mein, pad-thai and a curry dish. I can't say I'd order the chow mein again as it was just okay but the curry was really delicious, especially over rice. The pad-thai was definitely the stand out dish, for me. It is really, really good. The noodles are cooked perfectly and I love the texture you get with the ground peanuts. Also, if you like spicy, the little spice tray they bring out can really set the flavor off!! I noticed they offer shrimp pad-thai which I'd really like to try.\n\nThe service here was pretty good as well. Our waitress was helpful in explaining menu items to us and they kept our drinks full the whole time. I was also really surprised by the price. While most of our table drank water, there were a couple beers and the bill only came out to about $80 for 5 people. I'm no expert in Thai food but this is a solid spot serving up delicious food and I will definitely return!"

A good friend of mine who is also vegetarian brought me here for the first time nearly seven years ago.  I have been a devotee ever since.  My particular poison is the Panang Curry (spice level 8) with brown rice.  At lunch it comes with an egg roll and a tangy ginger or sweet peanut dressed house salad (soup's an option, too, I think).  It's just a little too much food, which leaves you with the choice of leaving happily over-stuffed or with a snack for later.  Dinner's a much larger portion, minus the egg roll and soup/salad.  I usually end up finishing it off cold the next morning for breakfast.  It's an incredible sequel to an already amazing meal.\n\nSome other tasty options my friends and I have tried are the chili mint, pad Thai, fried spinach (appetizer), and the tom yum and tom kha soups.  Or course, you can't leave without also trying their Thai tea.  They serve it in a tall glass, so if you order light ice and really savor each taste, you can get probably make it through your meal on one.  But why would you when you can just get another, right? :)\n\nIf you're in Vegas or will be visiting soon, make sure to give this place a shot.  It'll raise your standards for good Thai!"

Service every so often slips a little which explains my previous 1 star reviews. But when I start craving Thai food this is where I go, and I usually walk out very satisfied. \n\nPanang Curry or Chili Mint Chicken, medium heat = happiness. \n\nI try not to hand out 5 Star reviews anymore but Komol's earned 5 Stars from me before and its the only rating that seems to fit.

Instead of freshly deep fried tofu, they had them pre made and stored in the fridge for a week. Pad Thai was dry, salty, and too sour. The Panang curry that every reviewer is raving about did not taste authentic, if anything, they put BBQ sauce in it and made it taste weird. Believe me, I eat a lot of Thai food. In my opinion, Las Vegas has much better Thai restaurants than this one. I would have given it a two star, however our waiter was really nice and we enjoyed his service."

I mistook the fried wontons as being the cream cheese stuffed ones, but I was wrong. My first couple wontons didn't even have a filling so it was just friend wonton wrapper, but on the third one, I noticed something like chicken inside. Whoops. Then I had the shrimp pad thai at the \"Thai Spicy\" level which is their hottest level. The heat intensity was good but could've been hotter (I really like spicy food). I liked that the chili didn't detract from the flavor of the pad thai. But unfortunately, my shrimp was under seasoned and both the shrimp and noodles were overcooked. Noodles should have a little past al-dente consistency, but these noodles were rubbery and sticky. \n\nService: Granted I was there for a birthday party and there were 12 people on our table. . .but service was slow. Our waiter left a pitcher of water on our table and it showed just how they rarely came around. Once we'd ordered, it took a good 20+ minutes to get our food out. When the food came out, it was ticket by ticket since the check was split. One side of the table got food before everyone else. I ended up waiting at least 10 minutes after everyone else until my food was served. In Komol's defense, another person at our table didn't get her food until way after me so Komol comped her dish because it took so long. We kept asking for additional sake cups. It wasn't until our third request that we actually got them. \n\nOverall: Service could've been better and I've had way spicier and better Thai food. I would go back to try their vegetarian options, but there are better options available in Las Vegas."

The taro balls were SO GOOD too!! The texture/consistency was SO FRESH, and soft, and the whole dish overall, was such good quality ingredients and flavor.

A Church's next to a Popeye's. However, you have Lotus of Siam in the same parking lot as Komol. Yet, this works out perfectly for Komol. The lines for Lotus are so long, people say screw it and find this place a short walking distance away. It's ingenious.\n\nThis was exactly how my last visit went. Lotus of Siam had something like an hour and a half wait. We got put on a waiting list, waited half an hour and said forget it. Went to Komol with some friends. We were seated pretty quickly and got some waters and drinks. It took some time to get our food orders in. There seemed to be only a few servers on duty and Komol was packed with Lotus of Siam overflow.\n\nThe problem was waiting. We were on a waiting list that I could check on my phone with. So probably an hour after we had sat down at Komol, I got the notification that our table was ready at Lotus. At this point at Komol, we had just received our appetizer. Seemed to defeat the purpose of choosing another restaurant if the wait was going to be just as long.\n\nWhen it comes to the food, it didn't blow me away. I believe we ordered each version of the pad thai and it was fine. It's a bit skimpy on the actually meat. However, they did deliver on the spice though. The servers, to their credit, did refill waters often. Probably wasn't hard when you could see my forehead sweating across the joint. It was more of a favor to me than anything.\n\nOverall, it's a perfectly acceptable Thai restaurant. Didn't impress me though and the wait to get food was a bit on the long side."

There are many options, and all come with an egg roll, and a soup or salad.  Go with the salad, since the peanut sauce is AMAZING.  Just the right amount of sugar and salt.  The vegetable soup was bland and forgettable.   \n\nI ordered the Panang Curry with tofu, my friend got the Indian curry with chicken.  I asked for the Panang extremely spicy, but it came out mild.  The curry was a little chalky, and needed to be cooked a bit longer or needed more water.  The Indian curry was spicy and tasty.  \n\nThe menu is very large, and I would come back to try a few more items, even though the ones I had were nothing special.  \n\nThe biggest short coming of this place is the time it takes for your food to get to the table.

My first attempt on finding this place led to inevitable failure. I went back to the hotel room and researched the area via google maps to realize, that dead looking area has actual stores that are open.\n\nWith CES going on only a couple of blocks away (at the LV Hilton) I was surprised to see that it wasn't packed. It certainly wasn't empty but all of the surrounding restaurants during the convention were filling up quickly. I ordered the green curry (via yelp reviews) and boyfriend, the oh so adventurous, got chicken fried rice.\n\nI was more than pleasantly surprised to find that the reviews weren't kidding, the portion sizes are ridiculous. Even with my enormous appetite, I only polished off half the dish. While some may say that they don't give you enough rice, I think they give you just enough. You don't want to fill up your belly with those carbs, you want to fill it up with that delicious green curry and all of it's creamy glory.\n\nAfter leaving Vegas, I became obsessed with green curry. Unfortunately, I have yet to find one that is quite as good"

The only thing I did not like was when my main dish came out, it was cold. The food itself was just OKAY. The texture of the chicken was a bit rubbery, definitely not all breast meat.  I am the biggest panang consumer in all of Las Vegas, and I immediately noticed the panang recipe here is much different than most other Thai restaurants. Not my favorite here. Yet, our Phad See Ew noodles were rather enjoyable. Vegetarian options are available. On a side note, I did like their custom engraved menu covers. Hieroglyphic style Komul engravings on real wood. Cool!"

See attached pic. \n\nThen I decided to try the Goong Hom Sabai, aka wonton wrapped shrimp. When the plate arrived it had 6 shrimp and a nice pile of fried onion rings on the plate. I tried one of the shrimp, but was pretty disappointed on how thick and floury the wonton tasted. I didn't eat anymore, because it was just not good. However, the onion rings were delicious!!  The very friendly waiter told me he would take it off my ticket since I didn't eat the shrimp, but I told him he could charge me, since I ate the onion rings and loved them. Of course he took it off anyway. \n\nNext I ordered the Pad-Kee-Mao with pork, even though the menu only says shrimp and chicken.  This was pretty good, but a little less basil would be preferred. I love the big flat noodles and it had a good flavor. I ordered it a 7 on the 1-10 hot scale, and it was just right...even a little nose run at the end of the meal. \n\nLastly we finished off with some non-dairy coconut ice cream. It was very tasty...glad my friend ordered it. \n\nI will be back here for sure!!"

I spent 10 minutes trying to figure this out. The area is obviously one of the older areas of Las Vegas when it comes to strip malls, so you're going to be put off at first on location. \n\nOnce you get inside, the scenery is a little more appealing than what's outside. Came for lunch, there was barely anyone there and we got seated fast. The menus are made out of wood, and is huge! There's a number of items you can choose from, and there are meat dishes for those who aren't part of the vegetarian/vegan lifestyle. We ordered the fried egg rolls, which were a little smaller than expected. I felt for the time we were there with barely any people there, our food took longer than expected to arrive, but I figured in preparation it was well worth the wait.\n\nWe ordered the orange tofu, vegetarian pad thai, and a vegetable rice dish our server suggested to try. Everything was outstanding, and there were so much leftovers my friend and I both left with a full box for takeout! Service was great, my water was constantly refilled and the server was kind to answer any questions about the menu.\n\nEager to return to try more vegetarian/vegan options out. Komol truly gives the definition of a great hole in the wall restaurant in Vegas."

We also had the chili mint dish, brown fried rice with veggies, and Barramundi which had an amazing sauce.\n\nAll were dishes were excellent and the price was very reasonable.

Because it is highly rated restaurant and is recognised by The Las Vegas Weekly for one of the \"Best Thai Cuisine\" However, once I've tried I was quite disappointed with the restaurant food and service.\n\nFirst of all I have to say the restaurant has great selection of non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes.The parking was very convenient.Their food display and garnishes were quite beautiful.The wooden carved menu was kind of pretty.The down side wss the location since it is located in an old complex(Commercial Centre) Anyway,my friends and I wasn't there to try their vegetarian menu.We were there to try the regular non-vegetarian dishes.\n\nFood\n\nFirst,my friend started with Nua-Dad-Deaw(Beef Jerky) and Fish Cake, I order Pad-Kee-Mao seafood(Stirred-fried flat rice noodles with Garlic,Chilli and Basil leaves), and other friend of mine ordered Beef Musaman.We had been waiting for a long time for our food to come even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all that night. We were extremely hungry. When our appetisers arrived we were quite excited with the food displays and they looked enticing.Once my friend bit on the beef jerky,she said it was quite chewy so I tried.It was quite disappointed since the beef  was quite tough like my friend mentioned and it was not that flavourful,but sweet. Then I tried the fish cake,I thought it was a bit better than the jerky.The fish cake did satisfied my palate,but it didn't taste or look like the typical&traditional fish cake at all.\n\nWhen my Pad-Kee-Maw Seafood arrived it is way too oily.I know that stirred-fried noodles supposed to be oily but not that oily like this restaurant made..Anyway,it tasted kind of ok.I think it will be more delicious if the restaurant didn't make it so oily. The last dish was Beef Mussaman however we get the vegetarian version instead of Beef Mussaman that we've ordered.So my friend asked our waitress to take it back and fixed it in a polite a manner,the waitress was silent and had no response.She just pulled a face,lifted the dish up and walked away. We had been waiting for our Mussaman Beef to come,but the restaurant didn't fix it for us and our Mussaman Beef never come back to us. So we have to cancelled it. \n\nService\n\nTerrible,terrible service!!!.Firstly,I spoke Thai to the waitress there,but she spoke English back to me which I found it was very rude of her to do so(I am Thai and she is Thai ) Secondly, the waitresses weren't attentive.They didn't ask us whether \"is everything alright\" They just walked pass our table a lot of time without asking anything.Either me or my friend had to call or grab them whenever we want more water or in need of something.\n\nOverall\n\nI don't know about other customers ,but my  friends and I didn't have a good experience when I visited this restaurant.The service was unexpectedly bad and the food were not that great. I found the service were unfriendly and inattentive.Common! for a the price that we paid,the products and service should have been better.We ended up paying more than $60 dollars and still hungry.I am not quite sure for the future return to Komol Restaurant.Like I said I have been to lots of Thai restaurants,some good some bad,but I would say Komol is one of the worst ones for both and service.Even though I perfectly understand that some Thai restaurants in the USA do not cook authentic Thai dishes,but how about the service???I am extremely surprised that this restaurant get a good review and 4 star rating.According to my experience it is worthed only 2 stars."

            "review": "I finally managed to try the oldest Thai restaurant in the Sahara Commercial Center. It didn't live up to its standards.\n\nKomol is one of three Thai restaurants within a hop, skip, and a jump of each other, and it's almost certainly been around since before I was born. It's also the last of the three-headed beast of beloved, dare-I-say hyped Thai restaurants that I had to try. So I stopped in to try a lunch special today. It does seem like the decor could be from an older time, but it's still clean and has friendly waitstaff. It's fairly brightly lit and the atmosphere was relatively quiet when I dined in.\n\nI chose the panang curry lunch special ($7.95) with beef, owing to recommendations from Yelp friends and the server's answer to my inquiry on which dishes were the most popular. They first brought out an egg roll w/ sweet & sour sauce and horseradish, and my choice of side in the egg drop soup. Both were good but not particularly impressive, and I found myself having to add salt to the soup.\n\nThe curry came out, and it was oddly... not high in temperature. Mostly warm, to be sure, but I  usually expect it to be painful to the touch, you know? This was perhaps an ominous sign. The curry was pretty good, but it wasn't as impressive in flavor as others that I've had, and I was surprised that the \"mild\" level of spiciness was a 1 or maybe 1.5 at best. I will say that the meat portion was very generous, although it was a fairly generic cut of beef. The veggies were fine but not spectacular and not as abundant as you'd expect from a place that specializes in vegetarian cuisine. My biggest gripe at mealtime was that the rice had a few grains that were hard (read: tough to chew, as opposed to uncooked).\n\nThe problem that I had later that afternoon was stomach pain. I didn't have an issue that required me to visit a restroom, but I'd give it a 3 or 4 out of 10, if 10 is the most tortured my intestines have ever been. I'm sure this was caused by Komol because it was my first meal in 16 hours, and that whole temperature issue was a tip-off.\n\nI may give Komol another chance, but I'm not sure why I should be so generous with so many other great Thai restaurants in town, some of which are just a short stroll away.. My intestinal fortitude is the only reason that I haven't dropped the rating further, and if I'd had to drag myself to the toilet... you know the punchline."

I kept going back, though, thinking it might be just that one day that they were not on their game, but it became a pattern. \n\nA couple of months ago, I went here with my mom and brother and we ordered a few dishes.  Some highlights:\n\nRice was undercooked.  white rice.  undercooked.  served to us.  \n\nThe salmon on the salmon curry was severely undercooked, too.  It was basically lightly seared on the outside and had about everything raw in the inside, and I wasn't in the mood for sashimi for lunch that day. \n\nAnyway, we informed the server and he quickly gave us a new bowl of rice.  The server also took the salmon dish, since it was too raw for our taste.  When the dish was returned, \"fixed,\" it wasn't a salmon that was on our plate.  It was actually a fish with white meat.  It didn't even taste like a salmon.  They thought that they can pull a fast one on us, since the curry was orange and encapsulated the whole fish.  smh.  We informed the server of this, and he quickly came to defend the dish, stating that, \"It IS salmon - it came out of a package.\"  Ok, well maybe the chef picked from the wrong package (intentionally, perhaps, to save money by using a cheaper fish)?  The chef knew what a salmon looked like a few minutes ago.  The server then agreed that it was a bit on the non-pink side and just deducted that dish from our bill.  \n\nIf this experience isn't worthy of the 1 star, I don't know what is."

And what a blessing because I have found my new favorite dish in the Herbal Salad. The other items that we ordered were also delicious and comparable to other Thai restaurants. I would be happy to order them again: beef green curry, chicken fried rice, and chicken larb. I will probably skip the combination vegetarian appetizer and Lad-Na with pork next time (and there will be a next time). The menu is so extensive that there are other dishes I want to try anyways.  Their menu is no joke, weighing in at 5 pounds.  \n\nI can't wait to return. The service was very friendly and attentive.

However, it wasn't anything special back then.... I had only ordered Pad Thai.  Although it was tasty, I didn't find it very special so had not written a review for it.  But today, today was a different story.  :D\n\nThe entree we ordered was Chicken Chili Mint.  It was pretty good.  Ground chicken with a variety of spices that included mint and fresh red chili (hence the name).  We ordered it mild and BOY was it mild.  I would recommend medium heat. The waitress said mild is about a 4 out of 10 in the heat scale...However, it didn't taste spicy at all.  Wasn't a bad portion either.  It left enough room for two desserts.\n\nWe ordered the banana steeped in hot sweet coconut milk.  Oh how it reminded me of the Vietnamese desserts I had as a child...It made me feel like I was a kid again.  Warm, soothing, rich coconut milk drowned the chunks of firm bananas.  The texture of the bananas were spot on.  It still held it shape and was not at all mushy in texture.  This dessert packed sooo much flavor!  I recommend sipping the coconut milk little by little.  It is REALLY sweet so I feel that's the best way to eat it.  Slow...to SAVOR the wonderful flavors  :)\n\nI ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice...and it was absolutely amazing!  The sticky rice was very warm and with the cold ice cream sitting on top of it, it resembled a thai version of warm brownies with ice cream.  Anyways, here's the kicker...the coconut ice cream is HOUSE-made!  Technically, it's not ice cream.  The base is simply coconut milk and fresh coconut water, so the consistency is more icey (kinda reminds me of a sorbet, but not as refined).  I happened to like that it had those larger icicles because it cut through the decadent sticky rice pretty well, very refreshing.  The coconut milk \"sorbet\" had thinly sliced fresh coconut and jackfruit.  I would come back just for this dessert alone.\n\nMinus one star because upon entering the restaurant, they had a board with their specials of the day written on it which included Mango with Sticky Rice.  However, when I ordered it, they said that they weren't serving any because the mangoes they had were not sweet/ripe enough yet.  So, I would suggest not putting something on the specials board when it's not available to order.  But I can't complain too much.  The lack of ripe mangoes was the only reason why I decided to try something new and ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice...haha...\n\nChicken Chili Mint + Diet Coke + 2 Desserts = $23  :)"

I felt that Komol lacked a little bit of both. \nI ordered the Pad Kee Mao noodles and the Garlic and pepper chicken. Both level 8 in heat.\nI really liked the flavor of the noodles, but the spice was not there. I would consider this a level 2 - 3 at other places. That is my biggest pet peeve when dining Thai. You are suppose to have the spiciest of foods, level 8 should BURN!! \nThe chicken was ok, but more garlicky that peppery. And again, NOT SPICY ENOUGH. One of the reasons I tried this place was because on their website they brag about the spice level and that they can \"heat you up\". \nUm, was that false advertising? Maybe I have to ask for the extra heat level? \nThe food had potential, but just didn't hit the spot, CLOSE, but not quite. \nI would like to add that the service was exactly what I would want. Friendly people who help you pronounce the dishes correctly and answer questions when asked. Both the woman who took my order over the phone as well as the person at the counter were extremely friendly.  \nI wouldn't say I will never come again, but I will try to be more specific when ordering if so.

My girlfriend does not.  Our friend is vegan.  On our way home from Vegas, we had to try Komol.  Upon entering, we noticed the calm and soothing decor.  This is not your standard ethnic, veg-friendly hole-in-the-wall.  \n\nAfter we were seated, we got the 411 from the server.  Now, we have been to Thailand.  It's a great country with friendly people.  If you go, be forewarned that fish sauce comes in everything.  Some places are more accommodating than others.  Armed with this knowledge, we asked the server about the ingredients in the Thai food.  He assured us that the vegetarian food contained no fish or oyster sauce, most of it was vegan, and they even used separate cooking oil and grills for the meat dishes.  The iced coffee contains milled white sugar, which some vegans eschew.\n\nThe iced coffee was sweet and very good.  We got lunch specials that included crunchy, tasty spring rolls that came with hot mustard and sweet and sour sauces.  We got vegetable soup that we all enjoyed.  You can request how spicy your entree is, and I like it hot and kicking, so I got the Hot and Spicy Vegetables with red curry.  Thanks to some chili peppers, it was hot and kicking, all right!  My girlfriend got Vegetarian Panang and asked for mock chicken with it.  I'm glad she did because it was delicious.  It was probably hotter than the level of moderate spiciness that she requested.\n\nAs usual, we were too full for dessert.  We left very satisfied.

The second visit I started to order the chef special curry and the waiter inquired as to my normal favorite Thai dishes and suggested I should really try the Panang curry which I had never had.  So I did.  And this time medium heat was 4.5 which is certainly close enough to 5.  Just different chefs in the same kitchen will quite often vary more than a full point.  I still think I like the thinner gravy to soak the rice in of the red curry, but I like them both."

Keep going in, cuz you are in the right spot! \n\nWe are fans here. When hubby craves Thai food, we only travel here. For him, it is bringing his memories back of seeing the foods on his travels there when he was younger. (and he has been looking for a place like this for a very long time - TRUST ME!)\n\nRight after entering you are greeted very quickly and seated promptly (or are given a good time estimate if waiting is the only option) They love kids here and are well prepared to accomodate towards them.\n\nHubby leans towards Pad Kee Mao (or some variety of the wide rice noodle). I like to mix it up. Papaya Pad Thai is very tasty - hubby wasn't super fond of it, but for me - I was just lapping it all up! Since we had the wee one, we had to keep it mild - :( - but one of these days we are hoping to have all mouths on fire!\n\nThe soft shell crab app is YUUUUMMY! Gives you that perfect taste, but doesn't weight your belly down so you get to fill up on the main course!\n\nChicken Chili mint - very awesome! Fire and ice in one bite!\n\nSeafood Basil Fried Rice - yuuuum! Can't tell you how many times I have been here with all the food, but I have never been disappointed. I always strive to have something I didn't eat the last time just to be able to say at one point that I have eaten everything on the menu! \n\nOh and let's not forget our beverage staple: Thai Iced Tea - traditional, (and now) red or green!!! Wish I knew the secret to making it, love it so very much - someone has told me before it was Lipton tea, but somehow I am doubtful - and am striving to know the secret to it. (note for the great internet research project). \n\nNow juuuust to be fair to the competition in the same parking lot - there is a Lotus of Siam restaurant nearby also Thai cuisine, but have yet to explore their restaurant. \n\nAnd lastly - can't review the desserts, since our bellies are always full to the brim by the time we are done! (oh did I mention you get to take home leftovers too?) That's right more bang for your buck! Ok now my tummy is getting hungry for Thai food..... hmmm Happy dining!"

For $7.95 you get an egg roll, choice of soup or salad (I always get the salad because the peanut sauce is delicious) and choice of entree (my personal favorite is beef chow mein no vegetable). The portion even allows for me to ask for a box so that I may take the left overs home. Another treat is to enjoy a Singha beer served in a frosted mug. \nThe service is outstanding. Servers always take time to ask small talk questions and establish a relationship with diners. I arrived at 11:00 a.m. and by 11:45 a.m. when I was leaving the dining room was nearly full. There were mostly single diners, and one or two tables of groups.\nIf you love Thai food I strongly recommend visiting Komol's. Their awards adorning the wall speak for themselves!!\nGreat Food."

            "review": "Let me preface this review by stating that I am totally unqualified to judge authentic Thai food since I've never been to Thailand, don't know anyone from Thailand, and rarely eat this particular cuisine. However, my niece loves it and it was her birthday, so off we all went to Commercial Center, which is the place to go if you're looking for exotic dining or exotic adult activities. We were thinking about Lotus of Siam, but we had a couple of small kids with us, so we didn't want to jostle with the crowds and picked Komol instead. (The presence of said toddlers also quashed the prospect of sampling any of the other available entertainments, as did the unfortunate way we look naked).\nAnyway, Komol was pretty full when we arrived, but we were seated right away, and the ambience was both attractive and comfortable. Service was a little slow, but I'm not deducting any stars because they were friendly and working their butts off, and we got everything we ordered, which was a lot. We had: Indian chicken curry, pork chili mint, fried shrimp in wonton wrappers, Thai beef salad, beef pad zee euw (sp?), chicken satay, and Thai beef jerky. Everything was delicious; the peanut sauce for the satay and the dipping sauce for the shrimp (plum, maybe?) were outstanding. Wanted to lick all the plates. Maybe I did. Only questionable thing was the jerky, which tasted fine but I found the texture (dried, deep-fried strips of meat) a little off-putting. Maybe because I kept thinking of that movie where the plane crashes in the Andes and the survivors are starving so they figure out a way to make a tasty snack. You get the picture. We can't all be Andrew Zimmern. Anyway, we were stuffed but still ordered a dessert to share- fried bananas with homemade ice cream.  Funny how there's always room for a little something deep fried. The waiter explained that the ice cream was vegan, which immediately set off alarm bells. I don't even want my vegetables vegan - coat those bad boys in cheese sauce, please! But, it looked like a harmelss ball of pineapple sherbet, so I bravely plowed in, or tried to. It was frozen so hard it would have made a better weapon than dessert, but the kids hacked away happily and finished it all, and it kept them so busy they didn't notice their share of the fried bananas disappearing. All this plus drinks was less than $80 before tax & tip. Not bad. Conclusions: Authentic? Who knows? They looked Asian. Delicious? Absolutely!"

And out of lemon sorbet?! How hard is it to keep those two items on hand, yeesh! A more minor gripe: we ordered ours with a heat of \"4\", b/c at many Thai places, \"5\" is almost too spicy for Western tastes...but at Komol, \"4\" doesn't have any heat at all :-( Finally, when we decided to order dessert, the older lady (not our waitress) came and mentioned that we had accidentally been seated in a table that had been reserved (even though half the restaurant was empty). I guess to make us feel bad for lingering over dessert. Oh well. We liked Lotus of Siam much better, that will be our Thai \"go to\" now that we live in L.V."

It's a little difficult to find, because the area that Komol is located in is surrounded by a lot of office buildings and some other assorted restaurants (including at least one other Thai place to make it extra confusing).  But I'm glad my family and I looked around for it, because the food is fantastic.  And there's a pretty extensive menu, if my memory is correct. The place has a lot of vegetarian and vegan options in particular, which is great if you have a big party and people who are particular about certain foods or ingredients. \n\nAnd I remember that the hostess was so sweet and patiently explained everything to us.  She checked in on us several times in a nice but not irritating way to make sure we were happy with our food as well.  I do remember that if you choose something spicy, it will be very spicy.  So consider that fair warning if you can't handle the pepper heat!\n\nThis place is at the top of my list for the best Thai food in town, regardless of what the Las Vegas mags might say.  Do try it and see what you think.  Everything on their menu was delicious, from their curries to the appetizers and drinks, so you can't go wrong with Komol."

We actually came for the vegetarian menu and ordered spring rolls and pad Thai. The vegetarian spring rolls were great, just a bit too much basil and the serving size was huge! The vegetarian pad Thai was also great, filled with veggies and tofu! Overall this is a good place to eat if you have money!\n\nPros:\n1. Vegetarian menu was delicious\n2. Beautiful menu design\n3.

They even have vegan home-made vegan coconut ice cream.\n\nWe ordered the Vegetarian Pud Zee Euw (8.95; Stir fried flat rice noodles with broccoli and soy bean sauce w/choice of American or Chinese broccoli) and the Vegetarian Dinner Special  #3 (10.95) which included an appetizer (Spring Roll),  soup (Mushroom Tom Kha) and  Vegetable Pad Thai for the main course.

The decor is wonderfully cheesy, but I really think that adds to the experience.  The menu is huge, but don't be intimidated!  Carnivores, please refer to the first half.  Veggheads, the second half is all for you.  \n\nMy favorite dishes are the Indian yellow curry, extra thick, both with chicken or tofu, the shrimp pad thai, orange gluten (so wonderfully deep fried and covered in highly sugared sauce!), vegetable chow mien, brown rice, and the fried bean curd appetizer.  My guy likes the green chicken curry.  I also love the iced thai teas they serve there with coconut milk.\n\nThe service is very slow, though.  You're seated, ten minutes later your order is taken, thirty minutes later you receive your appetizer, ten minutes later the main dish comes out, and you might get one refill on the glass.\n\nProbably the best thing about this place is the option to tell them how spicy you like it.  I always ask for my curries to be medium-hot, while the guy likes his super mild.  Very rarely are we displeased with the spicedatude of our food.  \n\nCaution: medium-hot at Komol does not correlate with spicedatude of Ortega or Pace salsas.  The guy has cried after tasting my curry.  Spicedatude definitions are also prone to change with the chef.  His mild may bring steam to your ears."

One of the least recognized items on the menu is the house special omelet. The name and menu description does the dish NO justice. It is to DIE for. The curries are all great, however, if you like a thicker curry, you will have to let them know as the standard at Komol is the runnier version, with exception of the panang curry. You can order the food pretty spicy. They go from 1-10, with 10 being pretty hot and then superhot levels 1-5. If you love thai food, this place is a MUST MUST MUST!"

I had the Tom young soup which was great, the panang chicken curry and the house chicken noodles. Warning to those who like spicy papaya salad, you won't be underspiced.\nI would recommend this little dive place, it will hit the spot but not empty your wallet!"

I can't stress how much of a pleasure it was to eat there. These are some great Thai recipes that are familiar but definitely all their own twist to them. Each bite was delicious. I found it through yelp and it was such a successful venture that I am a firm believer in its powers haha...Which is why I am passing on the favor of a positive review so others may find it. \n\nAnd since it's so far from the strip and a few miles from the Freemont Experience, we felt lucky to find it. Our waiter was fantastic and his recommendations were perfect. We had the Herbal Salad, which is \"yelpers\" favorite, as we learned from the waiter. It is incredible! So many flavors with great textures! I just remember the crunch of crisp apples, shredded coconut, lemongrass, and cashew nuts. Wish I could make it at home. Another highlight was the mushroom thom kha spiced up and their own coconut sorbet. Best meal in vegas by far. \n\nHope you have a chance to get there. Everything was great, the staff are very friendly and so helpful! And in the tradition of Thai cuisine, large portions and great prices for each dish! \n\nHappy eats!"

I know what you're thinking, I thought the same thing...\"um, commercial ctr, the same area as the green door?' i know, i know but you have to try KOMOL out\n\nnice, clean restaurant, not a big place, wait staff super nice. as for the food....AWESOME, piping hot when it comes to your table, not only is the smell delicious but visually its delicious.  \n\nwe ordered: (FYI - KOMOL does not used the 1-10 heating scale. when you ask for HOT/SPICY be careful, you get what you ask for, order a chai tea just in case)\n\nChicken Tom-Yum: (heat lvl med-high)\nif you are a mushroom kind of person, you will love this soup.  a lite chicken base soup, w/ chilies, lemon grass, lime leaves and lots of SHIITAKE mushrooms.  (they are very generous w/ the shiitake mushroom).  very flavorful, the vegetables are not mushy and lack of color.  very vibrant, refreshing soup.\n\nHerbal Salad:\nOMG, i like this salad ALOT, it may be new \"go-to\" item on the menu. julian sliced apples, carrots, coconut, grn onions, onions w/ a lemon vinaigrette mixed w/ cashews and top w/ \"hot\" pepper. this salad BURSTS in your mouth. you can taste element of this salad. the apples are grn i believe, they remind me of granny smith apples.  you have a combination of sweet, salty, savory, nutty and crunchy.  the coconut adds another level to the salad. this is no cucumber salad here.\n\nChicken Pad Thai: (heat lvl HIGH)\nhow can you go to a thai restaurant and not order pad thai, HELLOOOO. \nmy, my, my, i've tried many pad thai's around the valley, this goes in my TOP 3.  now we asked for a lvl 10, the waiter informed us that they do not do the # thing. but he's get it to that lvl for us. HA! you like SPICY/HOT then order high, heaping portion. the colors are amazing, your pad thai does not look like it was all mashed together and cooked in 1 pot, drizzled w/ oil, YUCK. (i've had pad thai like that) just like w/ the other dishes, crispy crunchy vegetables, nice chunky pieces of chicken.  the pepper flakes in this dish does not make the HEAT, i don't know if the oil used to cook this dish is infused w/ peppers, u get heat w/ every bite.\n\nALL in ALL a great meal, reasonably price, good to share w/ friends"

Everyone knows about the other contender.  What I was not aware of, prior to this visit for a mid day impromptu lunch redemption, was that Komol lays out some seriously good Thai food.  \n\nSo here I was, far from my comfort zone again trying new and exciting entrees that I would have never even thought of trying before. My arm was twisted twice this day...once to go here in the first place (glad I did) and the second was to try a dish with tofu.  What?!!? No meat!  I now know what the big to do is all about.  The meal went like this...Fresh spring rolls that were delicious and unlike others I've had, not greasy.  Pad kee mow with tofu, spicy level 3 since I'm a baby.  This dish was quite tasty...at first I skirted around the tofu; then I believe I compromised it all and refused to share it.  The final dish was Panang curry with chicken; finally the meat makes its presence known...level 3 again.  \n\nSorry to all experienced Thai foodies, my pallet cannot yet handle the crazy spiciness; with time I will slowly increase this to a 10 and just know that over the next few visits I will be updating this review to a 5.  Thanks for a great meal."

However, my recent experience at the restuarant really threw me off.\n\nWe went on a saturday early evening. After we were seated we were not given a menu and no one came to check on us for 15 minutes. Finally we got the menu after we asked for it. The fried rice (our usual dish) we ordered came burnt and was smelling burnt, so we had to send it back.  This was the first time we ever sent back a dish during all the visits we have been there. Apart from the fried rice problem, other food was good that earned the 2 star rating.\n\nThe service was practically non-existent, no one came to check on us anytime. Everytime, we need something we have to take pains to catch hold of someone. It was really horrible service.\n\nI would stay out of Komol at least for a few months. Also from food point of view, unless you are vegetarian, you can always go with nearby local restuarants such as Lotus of Siam or Satay both of them are pretty good so far.\n\nAfter a few months, I would try some togo's and watch their service before I can take my family back for a dine-in for I dont want to go through that horrible service again."

The rich dark broth was amazing, it tasted of stewed bones and soy, and with the chilies and pieces of stewed fatty duck, it was a complex combination of savory, fatty, spicy and sour.

            "review": "Instead of eating in any one of the glitzy spots on the Strip, I decided to look for something off the beaten track.  I got lucky and found Komol.  \n\nThe commercial center is rather an enigma, viewed from Sahara Avenue.  However, once you enter the inner parking area, you realize that you are surrounded by a mecca of authentic international dining options, Asian, Latin, African, Middle Eastern.  No standard hamburger shops, to be sure.\n\nI chose Komol for what was apparently excellent food and a vast menu.  From the moment I entered until the moment I left, there were many pleasant surprises.\n\nThe place was crowded and people weren't leaving.  This was on a Tuesday evening at nearly 8 p.m.  Those who came in and waited with me were locals.  Each of them declared that it was well worth the wait.\n\n30 minutes after arriving, I was seated.  As it was just me at the table, I couldn't order everything that I wanted.  So, appetizer, soup, and main.\n\nFresh spring rolls.  Off the chain fresh and delicious.  Clearly handmade just moments before coming to the table.  I've not had spring rolls this good for over 20 years, when friends used to make them for me at their house.  The sauces were wonderful compliments to the taste of the mint, noodles, bean sprouts, and other delightful ingredients.\n\nTom kha kai soup...was told by a local that after trying this, I would be dreaming about it for weeks.  Pretty much true.  I had it brought to me extra hot (10 out of 10, on the scale used by the restaurant).  It didn't blow the roof off my head, but it had definite heat.  Yet, the pungent flavors of the soup were themselves intact.  Mushrooms, chicken, lemon grass, coconut milk, each item had its own flavor and character yet blended into the soup beautifully.\n\nFor the main, I chose a red curry chicken special, towards the bottom of the page (Pad kee delight, I think?).  Chicken, with a wide range of vegetables in a rich, spicy, red curry sauce.  I ate the broth before attacking the contents therein.  And I used as little rice as possible, in order to fill my stomach with the good stuff!  \n\nI managed to finish all 3 courses, with 2 glasses of wine, for something under 40 dollars, if not even less.\n\nThe owner and staff impressed me, a visitor, with their familiarity with a huge number of clients, who are either regulars or at least regular enough that they shared talk about family, investments, football seasons.  The owner proudly informed me that 2016 marks 20 years of the restaurant being in business.  \n\nAt the end of my meal, the owner was seated behind me with his insurance agents, talking about his health insurance options for the coming year.  To be sure, those agents had had a full meal at the restaurant before he came and sat with them.\n\nA family run business with a family feeling in the heart of Las Vegas.  What a find.\n\nAnd the food was GREAT."

If you or anyone else is on a date and it's late in the evening you will always be sat at the last booth by the bathrooms. I don't know if it's a Thai good luck thing or what... I happened to be on a date there and was sat in that spot. AND on multiple occasions have seen awkward couples seated there as well. The nice thing about that seat is that if you want to see the entire Restaurant you are in luck, OR if you only want to stare at your potential life partner/pal/lover/romantic interest you are SET, AND have quick access to the toilet if they make off color remarks that offend your delicate sensibilities. \n\n2. Don't eat here if you are in a hurry. The food is amazing however the kitchen likes to take their time making your delicious treats. \n\n3. ALWAYS ask for it as hot as they will make it. They add fresh green chills to your dish if you ask for the hottest of the hot, and they are not only delicious, they are flavorful, crunchy, and HOT. -yum- \n\n4. IF you order the Sukiyaki (a favorite of mine) make sure you specify that you want it as the soup. ALSO don't expect the fish balls that they advertise... I've never had them in my soup. \n\n5. YOU WILL leave full \n\nYum... I just ate here last night and found another new favorite dish... I can't remember the name though, so sorry! It's a beef/potato curry and it's sweet, hot, savory, and makes me want to go there again tonight... \n\n...if I only had a date..."

We ordered the chicken panang curry and chile mint lunch specials and the herbal salad due to the great Yelp reviews.  I thought the overall flavors were just ok, I've had way better Thai. We ordered medium spicy, 5, it was more like a 7-8, pretty spicy and we can eat hot.  The herbal salad was just ok to us, not a 5-star dish. The service was friendly but oh so slow, took almost 35 min. before we were served after placing our order.  Probably won't go here again, I like the Thai BBQ joint on 3rd street better.  We have eaten Thai in Thailand, all over SCal and the best we've had in the US was at the Thai House in Fairbanks, Alaska and at Chanida in Yucaipa, CA (a hidden gem)."

The first item I had was the spring rolls which was suprising plentiful and meant for sharing, the sauce was the a great flavor but the rolls themselves were fresh and rolled tight.

We found it easily enough but I seriously questioned even going in after parking in front of the place.  It didn't even look open.  But we took a chance and I am really glad we did.\n\nInside the decor is basic but welcoming.  But I guess almost anything would seem welcoming compared to how the outside looks.  They have a great number of vegetarian options which is exciting for me as being vegetarian in Las Vegas is not all that fun.\n\nWe started with the vegetarian sampler for an appetizer which included lots of fried things like spinach and sweet potato.  It was good.  For an entree I got the basic vegetarian delight, but it was the best I've ever had.  The sauce was light and garlicky and the vegetables were plentiful and fresh.  The boy got some sort of veggie curry which he said was just on the border of being too hot for him, even though he likes spicy food and asked the waitress for medium heat.  Regardless, we were both very impressed and will definitely go back on our next trip. \n\nOne thing, the food did take a little while to get to us.  But in their defense, they do print right on the menu that vegetarian dishes are prepared specially and may take extra time.  It was definitely worth the wait, but if you're in a hurry i don't know that this would be the best option for a meal."

The food was good but it didn't match the taste of other places I have been to. Who doesn't give limes with pad Thai and why do I have to wait 5 mins when requested?! \n\nThe service has to be one of the worst I have ever experienced. When we got there, it was a little crowded but nothing out of ordinary. For a table of 4, once food was ordered, WE WAITED AN HOUR AND HALF for the food, and then the food came out staggered. \n\nOur waitress, while accommodating at first, became lethargic and dismissive towards us after the ordered was placed. \n\nThe 3 star review is hampered by the service and not the food, food: 3.75, service: -4.26, it doesn't add up but definitely not far fetched either. Not a fan and probably won't return."

We found it on a mission for vegetarian- and carnivore-friendly Thai, and the 6+ page menu offered something for everyone.\n\nHave had a couple of entrees here that were really good (unfortunately I don't recall exactly what I've had each of the couple of times we've gone now).  The pad thai was fabulous comfort food.  I was told the tofu curry (with heat cranked up to \"10\") was awesome.\n\nMy only complaint about them is that each time we've been there it has taken 30-40 minutes for the food to arrive.  I suppose it's a good sign really, implying that everything is being cooked freshly, but it can make for a really long wait with no food."

This is why its delicious but next time i will ask that they use less oil. if you dont like garlic or tofu, you wont like this at all. \n\ni've been eating here all week and i also had the tum yum noodle soup, which is different than the tom yum, it has rice noodles and a sweet and sour broth.  i had this with soy fish. if you are vegetarian and crave some type of seafood sub, this dish is a happy option.  i couldnt decide if i liked the broth or not, i guess i did but im not sure, i changed my mind about the broth with every other sip, i still finished the entire bowl while saying mmm out loud. \n\ni love this place and i give it 5+++ stars.  you wont find a place on the strip that feels more at home like komol's does for me. \n\ni dare you to try my favorites and then tell me its not good!"

I had my niece so decided against Arawan as it looked a bit fancy. Lotus of Siam wasn't open yet. All of them were highly rated so I thought I was in for a treat going with Komol.\n\nThe service here was really good. There was always someone around and they were very pleasant. \n\nThey have a huge menu and the prices are average. They have a large vegetarian section. \n\nThe food was okay in my opinion. Maybe it was an off day? All of the food, I ordered medium, had zero spice. My niece doesn't eat spicy and she didn't notice any spice.\n\nCombination Tom Yum Soup: chicken, shrimp, squid, and mushrooms in a sour, sweet, and spicy broth. This really lacked spice. It wasn't bad but it wasn't special. They were generous with the protein.\n\nShrimp Lad Na: flat noodles cooked in a wok with American broccoli in a bean curd gravy. This was good. There was a good char from the wok and it was full of shrimp. The broccoli was a little soft. I like a bite to my veggies.\n\nPineapple fried rice: chicken, shrimp, cashews, and pineapple. The portion was large but this was my least favorite. It tasted like the flavor base was ketchup? It just wasn't good to me. \n\nPanang chicken curry: this was good. It was served with a bowl of white rice. The flavor was good but definitely lacking a punch of spice.\n\nI was pretty disappointed with our meal. With a Thai tea it was about $60 without tip. When I want Thai food I want a flavor explosion in my mouth. I want dishes that have balance of savory, sweet, sour, and SPICE. Spice in two ways: Heat and full of spices. It wasn't there for me at Komol. Yelp usually never steers me wrong, but I was really disappointed. I may go back to have one of their vegetarian dinners but not any time soon."

They also have a fake banana plant, I thought it is super cute. I would give this place 4 out of 5 \nAMBIANCE\nCasual. This place can occupy nearly around 30-40 people. Looks tidy. I would give this place 5 on 5\nParking- Yes, it might get difficult to find a closer parking spot to KOMOL, however if you don't mind walking for a bit, there is plenty of parking space.\n\nFood- We have been to this place dozen of time when we lived in LV. The food is to die for. This restaurant has set a very high standard in Thai cuisine for my husband and I when it comes to Thai and we are still on the search to find the perfect place like KOMOL in Irvine, CA. We ordered hot sake, tom kha kai, chicken basil fried rice and fried rice. It is something about Komol, that their food is light and so much flavorful or just that they use super fresh ingredients  If I have fallen in love with Thai, it's because of this restaurant. 5 on 5\nSERVICE- The service was good for Christmas eve.  4 on 5\n\nOVERALL- If I am in LV I would make it a point to go back to his place.

My friend ordered a water with a straw and she did get the straw after asking about 3 more times.  Of course the bus boy not only did not speak English he did not bother alerting the guy that did if you tried to communicate with him.   The tea came in the cutest blue and white tea pots that leaked all over the place when you poured it.\nActually all their tableware was a custom blue and white pattern that was really nice.  If it had fit in my purse it would have been sooo gone! :-) J/k ....sort of.\nI digress. I had a Soup, I think it was Tom Kha vegetarian.  I asked for the spiciest they have.  It was really good except for one root type thing that was un-chewable like a branch.  My friend said her soup was great too.\nAt this point I was already super full but then the vegetarian curry came.  It looked great but it was so hot that it was pretty much inedible.  When I took the rest home I looked at it and it looked like he had just dumped a jar of chile peppers in there....\nIt did taste good though...\nSo, I guess the moral of the story is do not be cocky with your rating of spice although in my defense I always order it the hottest level at Lotus and it is always hot enough to make me sweat not cry.  This was \"mouth on fire then sneezing fits after\" hot.\nI reallize this review is not glowing but the funny thing is I really enjoyed it and can't wait to go back.

Also ordered the Herbal Salad, which was recommended here by several yelp'ers. It was very lemongrass-y, which was good for a few bites, but I could not eat a whole plate of it. My husband had no problem eating a good deal of it, though. The coconut milk curry was great. We also ordered the mango with sticky rice dessert, as well as the fried banana with homemade coconut ice cream. The ice cream is to die for. best I've had in a while-- and homemade! :)  Mango sticky rice was wonderful, too, and I haven';t found many places that make it with coconut milk only instead of sweetened condensed milk. So happy to find a vegan version!"

I alerted the staff the first time and they said they would take care of it. I didn't go back for a while. When my father was in town and staying nearby, he wanted to go to a good vegetarian restaurant. I decided to give them a try again (hoping the issue was resolved). After we finished our meal, my father pointed out a roach crawling by. =( That doesn't work for me. Please note, this happened June 2014. I haven't been back since. I hope they have solved the issue, but you might want to look around before you chow down."

I could eat a ton of this over vanilla ice cream or shaved ice.     \n     We also had a taste of coconut ice cream, very good.     \n        We ordered all the foods med spice, all I can say is this is the hottest med I ever had, I sweated buckets\n         I loved the servers because they spoke English better then me , really .\n        They could answer all of my questions and explain the menu to me and my wife.

            "review": "On my quest to find the best Thai food in Vegas, Komol is taken out of the race. \n\nLOCATION: Yes, Komol lies in the same shopping center as the Green Door. The Commercial Center has all the characteristics of a shady place. Its old, a little dirty, and you'll likely pass a few hobos. But hey, there's a few good places to grab a bite. \n\nFOOD: What strays me away is the wild inconsistencies between visits. Sometimes its good, sometimes its great, and sometimes I'm left disappointed. The stir-fry's usually come out quite good here. The usual Pad Prik King and Chili Mint Beef have never led me astray. But I must suggest to steer clear of the Yellow Curry. I believe the cooks are confused whether or not its a sweet curry or a savory curry. Its different every time. On occasion, I'll order a Pad Thai. Despite being a generic Thai dish, there are quite a lot of components involved in preparing the seasoning. A heavy hand on the tamarind or fish sauce WILL be noticed. The flavor varies visit to visit so I can't say I love it 100% of the time.\n\nSERVICE: The servers have always been really nice. The young man who usually waits on us is seriously one of the nicest most genuine servers I've ever met. But I'm not sure if they're understaffed or just relaxed.  When it comes to food, patience isn't my strong suit. Whether the restaurant is full or nearly empty, it takes forever to get our first plate. Entrees never arrive together and at times its hard to distinguish whether they forgot our order or its just coming out slow. Also, they're a little stingy on the napkins; request a couple extra before your food arrives. \n\nKomol has one of the largest, heaviest menus I've ever seen. Real talk, it is really heavy! A few pages of food are sandwiched between big chunks of wood. But what they gain in variety, they lose in quality."

You are most definitely in the right place.  \n\nThe friendly staff quickly greeted my gf and I and seated us in the slightly small restaurant.  The menu covers are made of big slabs of wood.  \n\nI got the veggie panang curry, extra spicy.  It was one of the best curries I have ever had.  Very creamy and coconutty, well seasoned, nicely aromatic, not too oily.  The portions are nice and big and so I took some home and it was even better two days later.  My gf got soy orange chicken.  It comes with these strips of 'chicken' about 2-3 inches long by only about 1/8 inch in width (squared).  So basically chicken sticks?  The orange sauce that it comes with is delicious and it isn't slathering the chicken like some places do.  Instead it is more of a subtle glaze that goes great with the crispy little chicken strips.\n\nI will gladly come here every time I am in Vegas and try something new each time.  I'll likely never get to try their desserts though since Luv It is so close by."

The beef salad was good but doesn't hold a candle to the salads or the tartare at Lotus. But the [pork] larb was also as good as I've had.\n\nFinal verdict is that if going to eat Thai in Vegas, I'm going to Lotus.  But if I haven't made a reservation and there's a 1+ hour wait there, I'm walking across Commercial Center to Komol-- and I won't be too upset about it.  That may or may not sounds like a ringing endorsement, but it is.  Uncle Boons in NYC is the only other Thai restaurant I've been to in the US that deserves to be listed with those two, and that's much more fancy (not in a good way).\n\nAlso, don't let the \"vegan/vegetarian\" tagline throw you off-- it has all the non-veg options you would expect."

It was stir fried in the garlic salt mix to perfection, except for the fact I had about 10 pieces maybe less and I was paying almost I think 15?

Not only do they have tons of vegetarian and gluten-free options, but the food is unique, addictive, and reasonably priced. Many dinner entrees are under $10, though I've been going earlier in the day when I sometimes take advantage of the $6.95 lunch specials.\n\nMy favorite dish is the Herbal Salad ($9.95), a massive mound of chopped lemongrass, tofu, green and red onions, cashews, apples, carrots and coconut mixed with hot pepper and lime juice (strangely enough, the only herb in it is basil). It's a dish I've never seen elsewhere and it is executed perfectly. It's texturally complex, a little sweet, a lot healthy, and has a heck of a kick. These happen to be the attributes I look most for in a dish, so I rank this as one of the top salads in Vegas.\n\nThe Penang curry, which I've had with both plump shrimp ($8.95) and just vegetables ($7.95), is coco-nutty, filling, and AWESOME, but if you come here without getting the curry peanut sauce ($2.50) you've done yourself an incredible injustice. You can eat this on a salad with the lunch specials, or order it as the perfect accoutrement to the ultra healthy and ultra herbacious spring rolls ($4.50). Unfortunately, my husband's favorite Thai dish, larb, wasn't done as well as at our other favorite Thai places in town, but I felt redeemed by the home-made non-dairy coconut ice cream (should labeled as sorbet). This was an interesting concoction that I couldn't get enough of, but then again I like weird stuff.\n\nI can't vouch for every dish on the extensive menu, but I would feel comfortable venturing from my recommendations on your second visit.\n\nP.S. This is an authentic Thai place so if you think you're a lover of level 10 heat, go for 6 or 7 instead."

The vegetarian selection is one of the largest in the city, and they have a wide variety of mock foods, such as mock duck, fish, pork, chicken, and beef. Having such a large selection of menu items to choose from means a lot to me, and the fact that they are extremely tasty and well-prepared dishes means that this restaurant has earned itself a loyal customer for life.\n\nOverall, the food is delicious and I love the atmosphere. They've been in the process of over-hauling the decor, so it looks better and better every time I go there. I enjoy taking friends and family to Komol, because I know we'll get a great vegetarian meal and friendly service each time."

We ended up walking out and paid for what we ate which was orange chicken only out of so many food we ordered. They even had the gut to get mad at us explaining that there were others who came there first. We understood that but 1 and 1/2 hours wait? No excuses. They did not even come to our table at least to say sorry for waiting. They just kept passing by on us and everytime we ask them where's our food at, they kept saying that the food will be ready soon. Worst place ever! I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone!"

I am sure they have been competitors for awhile, but I recently just discovered Komol restaurant and I am blown away by the flavor of the food!  I actually went twice in one week (seriously not planned) and both times the food has been great!  Service did lack a bit the second time, but the wait was worth it. \n\nThings my friends and I got: \n\n*Chili mint tofu with ground chicken - so flavorful!  MIx it with some fried rice, and this may be the only dish you need to order \n\n*Pad Kee Mao - this is my favorite dish in ANY thai restaurant.  Wide rice noodles, cooked in some flavorful thai sauce with chicken, vegetables.  Very yummy.  (Although still cannot compare to my favorite place in Seattle xD) \n\n*Herbal Salad - This type of salad was a first for me, especially in a thai restaurant.  It had a myriad of chopped veggies and apples, mixed in with lemon grass and a sweet spicy dressing.  Very refreshing and I promise you will not be disappointed...unless you are allergic to an item. ;-)  Also it is all vegetarian! \n\n*Beef Panang - Very good, but I wished they added some kind of vegetable to it, like string beans or something.  \n\n*Curry Fried Rice - amazingly flavorful!  Each bite was a mouthful of curry and I could not stop eating this! \n\n*Pad See Yew - Another great wide flat noodle dish.  Less spicy than Pad Kee Mao but just as or even MORE flavorful.  A must try!  \n\n*Green Curry - this was probably the only dish I was not a big fan of.  It was pretty bland, considering everything else was so tasty.  It may be that everything else was too flavorful that it washed out the flavorful of this particular dish....who knows.  \n\nI didn't really enjoy the ice cream served at this restaurant.  I wish it was more creamier.  The menu did state that it is home-made.  The thai tea ice cream flavor was there, but should be a bit creamier.  \n\nI will definitely be coming back here again!  Hopefully with more friends so I can order even more next time. =D"

We were wrong! $80 wrong between us! Don't waste your money here!\n\nStuffed chicken wings - very salty stuffing, not stuffed very well, lots of oil seeped inside, but despite that the insides still wasn't cooked.\n\nPad-Zee-Euw: the gravy tasted like flour and water and cornstarch.  Very cornstarchy made it gross.\n\nCombination Fried Rice: how the pho can you mess this up. i understand it's traditional to use left over rice for home made fried rice, but for them to use rice that has hardened from air exposure, that's just gross.  The vegetables seemed like an afterthought because they were still frozen.  \n\nBeef Noodle Soup: this is NOT beef noodle soup!  If this is your first time trying it, you'll think beef noodle soup is gross.  If you're an expert like me, you'll know they're ripping you off.  First off they just threw in 4 small pieces of beef into hot water with the spices from a packet of ramen and called it beef noodle.  Know how i know it's a spice packet from a bag of ramen?  Because the green onion wasn't fresh, it was the dry type, plus it tasted like ramen from a 20 cent ramen bag.  \n\nBeef larb: very bitter, the same bitterness as when you squeeze lime into the larb and leave it overnight in the refrigerator and the lime now tastes bitter.  It was obvious that's what they did because parts of it was hot and parts of it was near frozen."

We were blown away by the soft shell crab entree and chicken with greens that we just had to see if Lotus was THAT much better. The next day we went to Lotus and had Nam Prik and Khao Soi (their signature Northern Thai dishes) and wasn't that impressed.

As much as I love their lunchtime specials for keeping me satiated and sane during the work week, my recent (birthday) dinner experience was lackluster.\n\nFOOD\nMy friends and I started off with the Combination Appetizer. The fried shrimp and wontons, egg rolls, and those sweet slices of pork (my favorite part) started dinner off right. My fried tempura eggplant also served as a tasty introduction to my upcoming entree. \n\nAh, my entree. I should've stuck with my panang curry that I usually order, but I thought it would be best to try something new. Heaven forbid I venture beyond my culinary comfort zone. With a dish titled \"Angelic Duck\", one could only imagine it tasting heavenly. For $11.95 I wasn't expecting to fish for slices of duck among mixed vegetables floating in a sea of brown sauce. When I did discover some duck pieces, they were mainly fatty skin, which I absolutely despise. I felt deceived when I bit into a piece of skin thinking it was baby corn -- under mood lighting, those two things look the same. Hardly did I touch the rest of my meal. I ended up picking on my friend's chicken panang that she wasn't able to finish.\n\nOne of my friends ordered a special birthday dessert that consisted of three scoops of ice cream. The ice cream was hard and tasted old, and another friend pointed out how its texture resembles ice cream that was melted then refrozen. It was left unfinished. \n\nSERVICE\nThe house wasn't full when we visited, so what was the hold up with our food? Our orders didn't arrive all at once, and I received mine second to last. It was annoying to say the least. One of my friends placed her to-go order first because she had to leave, but she received it last and on a plate. \n\nOVERALL\nSad to say, I didn't have a happy birthday dinner, but I am happy that my friends enjoyed theirs. A future return is possible, but I won't be returning for dinner or to try anything else on their menu."

One of my favorite new dishes of 2012 by far.  Yes, a dish consisting of fruits, veggies, tofu, cashews is one of the best new things I've eaten in the last 8 months.  This should be the moment I just bow out of the whole Yelping experience altogether.  DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY BEEF AND PORK DISHES I'VE EATEN DURING THIS TIME SPAN?   Okay, settling down.   So yeah, Herbal Salad: freaking amazing.  Next.   Vegetarian Pad Thai (Tofu).   Enjoyed the flavor on this, but it didn't really seem any different than other versions I've had.  Still worth ordering if you're a big fan of Pad Thai I guess, as I usually am not.   Then we had the Chili Mint Chicken, which I liked a lot.  Ground up chicken sauteed with garlic. hot peppers and basil.  Pretty standard fare for a thai restaurant, but done exceptionally well.  Lastly I had to try the much raved about Panang Curry with beef.   I was actually slightly disappointed in this considering due to reviews I was expecting angels to descend through the ceiling and bless my lips and tongue after each bite.  That being said, it was delicious even sans angels.  It had a smokier flavor than I'm used to having from pretty much any curry I've ever had.  I appreciated the large bowl of sticky rice they also provided the table which was great at soaking up the curry and whatever other juices or bits and pieces the other dishes left on the plate.  \n\nThe only item I didn't enjoy was the non-dairy coconut ice cream I ordered at the end.  I didn't really expect it to be good because let's be honest, non-dairy ice cream just by principle isn't right.   The flavor was okay on it but texture-wise I wasn't a fan.   Little chunks of coconut were present and the overall texture was almost grainy, not smooth.   With so many amazing entree plates preceding it, I didn't really mind this mild disappointment."

The cuisine at Komol is classic Southern Thai and boasts some of the most unique blends of sweet and spice.\n\nAlthough I've yet to dine at Lotus, I can't imagine it could be worth such a wait when Komol is as tasty as it is and trumps all the Thai I've had all over town."

But the menu is presented in a beautiful menu book, broken down perfectly.  \nSooo many vegan options!! \n\nThe service is on point and there isn't a long wait to get your food. The staff is knowledgable and accommodating. Our waters never run dry there. \n\nThe food... Yum! We always get a level 7 for spice. We love heat. The curry is never watered down and the flavors never disappoint. Always consistently delicious and full of flavor. Lots and lots of veggies, they don't skimp on anything here. They give enough rice for the table And aren't nickel and diming for every little thing. Give this place a shot... It's my favorite Thai restaurant in town."

            "review": "Quickie review: This is my favorite Thai spot. They never disappoint with food. I love the restaurant itself. And we usually receive top-notch service. Though I have moved further away now...I continuously go out of my way to frequent this gem.\n\nFood: \nThis place has a wide-array of food to choose from. You'll probably notice from other reviews that Komol does have a good vegetarian/vegan selection. I don't mean like 10 choices...I mean pages of vegetarian/vegan options. They have a lot to choose from and with their various serving sizes, from individual to family meals...they can accommodate any group situation.\n\nThere food quality is always top-notch and they're consistent. People like to counter good reviews about Komol saying that Lotus of Siam (in the same shopping center) is better. While I will not deny the quality of Lotus....when it comes to a quality/cost ratio....Komol wins. \n\nPad Thai, Pad Zee Ew, Herbal Salad, Go See Me, Tom Kha and their curries are generally among the dishes we always order. For a taster, try there individual vegetarian meals (which they will make un-vegetarian for you)...you'll get to try appetizers, a soup and a large entree for the price for a great price. Not to mention, they have amazing lunch specials which basically make you feel like you ripped THEM off considering the amount of food you get and what you paid for it. Seriously. \n\n\nAtmosphere:\nThough the restaurant is getting more and more popular, it still has the feel of a quiet little spot. Pictures and artwork on the wall give it a home decor and their carved wood menu holders are an interesting touch.\n\nService:\nTypically, Komol has fast and friendly service. When's it's busy, the food may take a little long but it has never been ridiculous. The staff is willing to offer suggestions and are happy to introduce you to surprise dishes that you might have overlooked in their voluminous menu. Our last visit was a very rare night of bad service....like really bad....but I am going to chalk that up to a new server. If this becomes a trend, I will change my rating.  But, on the whole, all of our visits have been pleasant.\n\nOverall, if you want a great meal, especially with a group that wants to avoid checks that will easily hit the triple-digit mark like at Lotus, come to Komol. Their food never disappoints and you usually leave stuffed to the point of shame. And that's saying a lot considering I am the same guy who has zero shame about pounding down a triple-chili burger from Tommy's and can happily look at myself in the mirror."

I commend them for offering menu items there were not Vegan.  I'm all in for having my food prepared with meat, seafood or poultry. For me, they didnt't bring it with the flavor but would substitute with heat.  \n\nWhen I compared the two, I ordered the same items from the menu. The Garlics Prawns were cooked in a garlic sauce & really shrimpy (small). The rice was OK, and didn't have any flavor. I would go back again if there were no seats available @ neighboring Lotus where I know I will enjoy my meal & not simply eat because I'm hungry.\n\nHowever, when your order is taken you know they take pride in their service as well as the menu."

We walked in around 6:30pm and got seated right away. Everyone was friendly and said hello. I looked over the menu while they brought us water and was delighted to see all the different choices they had. I already knew in my head what I was craving, my normal pad-see-ew, but had to look on to see whatelse they had to offer. so many veggie options that I think I need to return and sample some soon!\nI ordered a glass of the house red wine and that was only $5.95. Filled to the top and def helped to clear my head and calm my nerves. I ordered like I said the pad-see-ew and was pleased with my choice. instead of meat I got the veggie option and asked the waiter what other veggies they add in besides the broccoli that normally comes with it (in the meat and veggie way.) He said they didn't really add others, but he could for me if I wanted. I told him that was okay just to add more broccoli. (i love my greens!) My plate came out with chinese and american broccoli so I was pleased over that. The black bean soy sauce was made just right and the noodles very wobbley like i like em! My boyfriend and I shared the orange chicken with sticky white rice. It was the best orange chicken I have had. Each piece so crispy and full of flavor. My tastebuds were in heaven. The sticky white rice is just as it says. very sticky too. some of the best I have had as well. My boyfriend ordered his usual pad thai set at a spice number 5. medium. When it arrived I was surprised with how spicy it was. For a 5 it was making my nose run and my mouth wanted some milk and I'm a girl who can handle her hot sauces and chili peppers!\nI am excited to go back and try a new dish I have never ventured into in the world of thai. The service was lovely and the prices were great. For all 3 dishes, a glass of red house wine, and a thai tea I believe it came to 41 dollars. We sure didn't break the bank, but we did make out with leftovers for days!\nThank you Dan T. for surprising me with this little (a little hidden) golden dinner date."

Two of which are Thai the other Indian. Komol is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant I have ever been to. As you walk in the door you see all of their awards including several for best vegan restaurant in Vegas. Always a good sign.\n\nAs usual I used my Thai barometer to gauge the quality of the food. The tofu Tom Yum and tofu pad kee mao were spot on with a Pascal reading of FANTASTIC! I left a full and happy patron. My taste buds although burning enjoyed basking in the wonderfulness of what I had just consumed.\n\nParking is plentiful and price was decent especially for Vegas. If in Vegas get yourself off the strip and eat some Thai that is twice as good as anything you will find on the strip and half the price. The cab ride will pay for itself."

So we walked around that complex, yelped, and decided to get dinner at Komol. We put our names down, and there were just a couple of other names ahead of ours so we were hopeful to get seated in about 15 minutes, but nope - took an hour and 20 minutes. By the time we got our starters, it was 2 hours and just then, we got a call from Lotus of Siam. In hindsight, we should have taken off at that point.\nThe Thai ice tea was decent, but it was all downhill from there. \nWe'd ordered mushroom Tom Kha, but got a Shrimp one instead. The replacement soup tasted like... well it didn't have one. The baby corn had clearly gone bad both in our Chow Mein and Red curry. \nBy this time, we were simple waiting for our check and get out as soon as possible, and that's exactly what we did."

Either way, my dining experience at Komol was one of the most unpleasant lunches I have ever had.\n\nThe meat. Dear God Almighty, the meat. Perhaps they accidentally gave me food out of the garbage? I ordered the Red Beef Curry and it was disgusting, absolutely disgusting. \n\nMy co-workers ordered chicken and seemed to fair fine, but I made then sample my beef and they agreed it was awful. The bad beef alone might have gotten them three stars, but the complete disregard for the fact that they were serving inedible food is what gets them one star. \n\nI did not eat even 1/5 of the food brought. When the waiter asked if I wanted to take the   rest home, I said no. I asked the other people if they wanted the food, and they all said no. One even said, \"That meat is awful\" while the waiter was there. \n\nThe server's response? \"Ok.\" Not a word of concern, not an offer to bring a new dish. Nope. Komol will serve you garbage and does not care if you hate the food, just as long as you pay.\n\nMost restaurants notice, and care, if someone doesn't eat their dish and doesn't take it home either. That's generally the universal sign it was bad. Most restaurants will try to get you something else or ask if there's anything they can do to fix it. Not Komol. Komol wants you to pay and get out.\n\nGiven the great reviews from others, I'm assuming there are other, more edible foods on the menu. But, take my advice, stay AWAY from the beef. And stay away from Komol if you want a place with good customer service.\n\nFor a delicious Red Beef Curry, try Le Thai. The beef there is tender, high quality, juicy, and does not taste like garbage."

What brought us here was a magazine list of spicy restaurants in the U.S. and this one happened to be in the city we were in. Now me and my boyfriend love spicy food. So we call up one of my friends and are there not even a few hours later.\nThe place wasn't too busy for a weekend, and we got seated right away. The menu had a huge selection. The three of us decided to share the Tom Kha, Herbal Salad, Pad Kee Mao, and Chili Mint Beef. \nTom Kha - I don't think I have ever had a tastier soup. It's a perfect combination of spice and coconut milk. \nHerbal Salad - Crispy, refreshing, and citrusy. Like this salad and the soup alone earn 5 stars.\nPad Kee Mao - Flat noodle dish, tasty.\nChili Mint Beef - I was a little too overwhelmed by the chili to taste any mint. But I don't blame Komol since my boyfriend ordered it a level 10 spiciness. \nI really love that this place does turn the heat up though. At a lot of Thai places, 5 is just barely spicy and 10 is like eh. Here, 5 is regular spicy and at 10, you're on fire.\nHoping to be back in Vegas soon to stop by here!"

Finally I told my boyfriend to turn left at the area where it said the restaurant supposedly was and explore the dark plaza that Komol is located at. We were very close to leaving when I spotted a small sign that said \"Komol\". \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we saw that it was very busy and very crowded (that's a good sign right?!). Despite the busy environment, it only took us about 2 minutes to be seated. Immediately they took our drink order and we spent a few minutes looking over the menu. We decided to order beef pepper steak, ginger chicken, and garlic fried rice with chicken. \n\nThe breakdown:\n\nPepper Steak: The pepper steak came out as a \"family sized\" portion, meaning it was much bigger than we had imagined it would be. The sliced pieces of meat was served in a brown pepper sauce along side chopped strips of red and green peppers and onions. The flavor of the sauce was amazing and tasted great with the rice as well! \n\nGinger Chicken: The serving of ginger chicken was also what I would consider a \"family sized\" portion, so if you order this be prepared to share! The chicken had just the right amount of ginger flavoring from the sauce it was in. The dish also comes with red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. \n\nGarlic Fried Rice w/ Chicken: The garlic fried rice literally made me say \"wow!\" when I tried my first bite. The garlic flavoring was subtle, but enough to create a unique taste for the rice. Once I had my first bite, I just wanted to keep eating more (sadly, it wasn't my order). \n\nThe food at Komol is amazing and delicious. Proof of this is that none of the people who accompanied me that night were hungry, but once they had their first bite of the food, they couldn't stop eating! Yes people, it's that good. I definitely will be coming back here to try their other dishes."

It seemed rushed onto the plate, not that I'm all that concerned with plating and presentation, but it was not only ugly but tasted bland and missed the mark on the 8 spice level I asked for. There was kind of an overflow of gelatinous gravy on most of our plates. My girlfriend's dish tasted bland as well. We thought the staff was really nice and it was a comfortable place, but the food left me knowing I'd need a 2nd dinner or at least a snack later, it didn't hit the spot.

As a vegan I am always looking for good places to frequent when I do not feel like cooking at home. I went at lunchtime on Sunday and started with a cucumber salad.  It was refreshing and more than enough to share. For the main course I ordered a lo mein dish and orange tofu (I am on a serious hunt for a great orange tofu).  Both were good and the portions were plenty to satisfy my post-swap meet hunger.  \nI only gave 3 stars because the service was a bit slow for the number of customers in the restaurant and the orange tofu was a bit on the well done side.  I will be sure to visit again, probably for dinner."

So when my husband was craving some Thai for dinner, I'd suggest Lotus of Siam instead... But then I was informed by Jaime w. that while Komol can make everything on their menu vegetarian, they do serve meat, and their meat dishes are amazing, so we decided to head there for dinner one Friday evening. \n \nThere was no wait to be seated, which was a relief because we were both very hungry. The menu is extensive, there were multiple dishes that looked good so we decided to order 3. \n\nMy husband loved the Mongolian Beef... so much that he is disappointed with every other restaurant's Mongolian Beef now. He also enjoyed the chef special curry...  I had the Papaya Pad Thai, I tried to order it mild but our waiter convinced me to go with medium heat. I am a big old wussy so it was a little too spicy for my personal preference but it still tasted good. \n\nWhen you do not have a reservation at Lotus of Siam and do not want to wait for a table there, chances are you can head over to Komol and get seated immediately. Couple that with great flavors, fairly good service and fair prices, and you have a winning combo."

One of the pleasant surprises was that the person who answered the phone & took my order-to-go information spoke perfect English, which reassured me that my order would be understood over the phone.\n\n Now, the location is... both fascinating & creepy.   I was there at about 4:30PM on a Saturday, and the massive strip-mall was mostly devoid of life, save for a few areas.  Made sense once I saw that many of the strip mall storefronts looked abandoned.   Entering the mall area off of Charleston Ave, Komol is on the far side, and strangely, it's right next door to another Thai (/Chinese) restaurant!\n\n  If you're the type that gets nervous in 'ghetto' areas, you'll certainly want to avoid Komol at night.   As for me, I am extremely curious as to what that mall looks like at night.\n\n  The food was good, but I get Thai food a couple times a month & am continuing to try new places to find one that really stands out above the rest.   I certainly will be happy to order from Komol again if I'm in the area & wanting Thai food, but in terms of flavor & value, the items that I had didn't stand-out above most other Thai restaurants in the LV & Henderson areas that I've tried."

Pass (2).\n\nWe wanted to try another Thai joint in this plaza but we found that it wasn't open early enough for me to get to work. So we hit Komol instead. \n\nI ordered the pad thai lunch special while the hubs ordered the stir-fried eggplant special for $6.95 each. The lunch specials come with soup/salad with spring roll. We both opted for the salad with the curry peanut dressing. \n\nThe spring roll lacked filling and was flavorless.  The very meager pile of romaine was overshadowed by the gnarly goopy peanut butter based dressing on top. Not appetizing. \n\nPad Thai was really weird and oddly sour. I was not impressed that they left the long browning tails of the bean sprouts on the sprouts -  a) it's unappealing,  b) it has a nasty hairy mouth feel, c) any Asian worth their salt knows you can purchase bags of this completely and properly prepped (without the head and tail of the sprout) from Chinatown for dirt cheap. Portion size was small. \n\nThe eggplant dish was truly horrible. On the edge of raw,  the eggplant had an unpleasant styrofoam like texture. Lacking wok hai, the dish was bland and unpalatable. Served with a side of rice,  the amount provided was meager but given the poor quality it wasn't a bad thing. \n\nService was slow. It took a while for the food to arrive (at least 20 minutes for the spring roll and salad,  30 minutes for the entrees). Definitely not a good place to grab a quick 1 hour lunch. \n\nGiven the quality of the food and the slow service,  there is no reason to return. 2 stars."

The restaurant was packed, so I understood the service being a little slow.  We had to ask for hot tea about 3 times, and we finally received it toward the end of our meal.  We also got a side of sweet and sour sauce when I asked for the chili and hot sauces.  The chili sauce came toward the end of our meal, again, and when i took the lid off, they were pretty much empty.  \n\nI don't know if it's because I've been so spoiled by all the amazing authentic restaurants in Thai Town in LA, but the food here was mediocre.  The tom yum soup did not have as much flavor as other tom yums I've tried.  But the presentation was cool (see picture)!  Our group ordered 2 chicken pad thai dishes and both were super dry.  The best thing we ordered was the Panang curry.  It was spicy and had lots of flavor.  \n\nOne thing that I really wanted to get if I wasn't so full by the end of the meal was the mango and sticky rice dessert.

I will specify no water chestnuts, no baby corn.

Snow peas, American AND Chinese broccoli, and bok choy - I almost wanted to run outside and scream to the world, \"I found it!\" It may be simple, but purchasing and chopping all of these items is too much of a commitment for me. \n\nSo for me, this is a perfect dish.

Usually when I get this, I finish all the noodles before the chicken. That's when you know it's a lot! And they don't use that weird oily orange sauce I've seen at other restaurants. It's my favorite dish to get!  \n\nPanang curry - I was never a fan of curry until I tried this. The coconut curry taste isn't overpowering and they add just enough spice to compliment the other flavors. (I love taking the panang curry sauce and putting it over my pad thai noodles, a little unorthodox, but it tastes amazing!)\n\nThai tea is also pretty legit. It doesn't taste powder and it comes in a tall, slender glass with cream layered on the top. It's a tasty treat before you get your food. \n\n*lunch is from 11-2:30 and it comes with soup/salad and egg rolls. The amount of food is definitely NOT lunch sized, I had plenty of food left to take home.\n\n*if you're ever trying to cut carbs, try the papaya pad thai! It's almost like the real thing! Papaya is used in place of the noodles and it is great! I could barely tell the difference! \n\n*their spice level isn't really up to Thai standards...

It's nicely decorated with lots of pretty lotus paintings on the walls and flowers near the tables.\n\nOur waitress brought us to our table and handed us some rather large menus that were full of delicious Thai options! I was in the mood for Pad Thai, and decided to get a vegetarian dinner meal that included a fried veggie spring roll, Tom Kha, and Pad Thai with fried tofu. I enjoyed the Pad Thai, but it was seriously lacking in peanuts! I've had this particular dish better elsewhere. I also did not care for the Tom Kha. It's a spicy, coconut soup that I found oily and sour. On a side note, Hubby's Garlic Tofu was really good, even though our waitress forgot his request for no onions. For dessert, we ordered Mango Sticky Rice, but she informed us that mangos were \"not in season\". Just my luck! :( She also noticed that I hadn't touched my soup, and politely offered me a different kind. It was a nice gesture, but I was already so full.\n\nIf you're not a vegetarian (like myself), don't feel limited here! Komol offers an extensive variety of Thai cuisine for both vegans and non-vegans alike. I am super eager to return to Komol to try another one of their Thai dishes.

The food is always great and if they end up giving me something that wasn't what I wanted, they had never given me any problem about fixing my orders. The waiters have always been friendly too. It's in a not-so-ideal location, but it doesn't even matter to me. It's definitely worth the drive! Try the Thai-style fried rice! Always a favorite for me. Or the garlic beef. Yum!"

A little oily, but less greasy than most thai places.\n\nThe food is legit, and it's great for vegetarians.  My vegetarian in-laws rave about this place as well\n\nI don't know what I ate (had a lot of different plates), but all I can say is that I liked it all!\n\nAnd just to stress the popularity of this restaurant, it is located in the commercial center in Vegas.  Commercial center is a graveyard for restaurants location wise (in my opinion), but the parking lot is still full because everyone is at Komol!"
