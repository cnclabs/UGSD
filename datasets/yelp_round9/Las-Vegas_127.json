            "review": "They had organic eggs and fresh local produce. I highly recommend the fresh squeezed organic OJ! I had the omelet and they even accommodated my request to add mushrooms and spinach to it. I don't know what kind of mushrooms they were, not the usual breakfast diner kind, something small and exotic and tasty! Everything was fresh. It was a wonderful breakfast and the windows overlook the pool area, so we got to watch people in teeny swimming suits splashing around while we ate. My companion ordered bacon and hash browns. The hash browns were pretty standard, shredded cooked potatoes, a little plain, but the bacon was very good. Large strips, and a serving was four of them cooked to perfection. The waitress was friendly and helpful."

            "review": "When I visited for Sunday Brunch three years ago, it was so wonderful! I'm sad to say I didn't visit again, but I spoke highly of my experience and had every intention on returning. I remember the freshness of the sashimi most of all and the extremely talented sushi chefs available. The other dishes and breakfast pastries were tasty as well. Oh, and the view of the pool is nice. I don't recall hating anything.\n\nMy most recent visit was on 06/04/13 with the whole family. I was excited to come back and have everyone else try it as well. Our server was phenomenal. So personable, really great with everyone, and very attentive. I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant - fancy, but not too fancy with modern and fun decor.\n\nMy fiance and I started with the Spanish Octopus appetizer (grilled octopus, charred potatoes, sweet peppers, lemoncello vinaigrette). The octopus didn't seem fresh or perhaps not cooked properly, so the texture wasn't amazing. The flavors were just okay. I was disappointed. We also ordered a salad for the table; Roasted Cauliflower Burrata with duck salami, aged balsamic, pine nut brittle. This was really good. I loved the roasted cauliflower, the salami was light, burrata was creamy, and the brittle was a nice touch.\n\nThe entrees and sides: Big Eye Tuna (seared and served with summer vegetable mint quinoa, finished with jalape\u00f1o cilantro cream), Gemelli Bolognaise (housemade ricotta cheese, fresh basil made with beef, veal and lamb), Morrow Bay Black Cod (bacon cider vinaigrette, salad of chile shrimp & baby greens), Mama Simon's Meatloaf (mashed potatoes, succotash made with beef and veal), Red Thai Curry (Kaffir lime, pineapple chutney, jasmine rice, with shrimp), Truffled Mac & Cheese with Lobster, and Signature Crispy Sesame Rice with Spicy Tuna.\n\nThe tuna was just meh. Quality, flavor all lacked. The cod was also just okay, meatloaf wasn't flavorful and a bit dry, and the mac & cheese was overwhelmingly truffle. The best entree of the group was the pasta. I thought the bolognaise was delicious and I love the topping of ricotta. The spicy tuna with crispy rice was amazing. I should have just ordered sushi!\n\nWe ordered three desserts for the table. Sorbet Trio of Raspberry, Mango, and Lemon and two others (can't remember their names). One was a chocolate pudding cake I think with ice cream or gelato. The other dessert was like a deep-fried apple pie? There was caramel and a delicious salted caramel ice cream/gelato. They were delicious. The sorbet was refreshing. They also brought us the Simon Junk Food dessert platter (brownies, caramel corn, Sno Balls, Rice Krispie treats, Cup Cakes, cookies, cotton candy). It was definitely more fun than tasty. The cotton candy was good!\n\nOverall, the meal was pretty disappointing. No one was extremely pleased or blown away by their entrees. Partnered with the high prices, I doubt anyone plans to return. I might give the brunch another go or at least just stick to the delicious sushi/sashimi. But everything is so hit or miss that I'm not sure it's worth the risk."

            "review": "What a major disappointment.  I always thought the old Simon at the Hard Rock was kind of unimpressive, so I was convinced that the new Simon would definitely be an improvement.  Wrong.\n\nThey really missed the mark on this one.  The space is beautiful, I will give them that.  A very chic and clean ambiance, while you dine poolside and check out the view of the Palms fantasy tower.\n\nThe positives pretty much end there.  The fact of the matter is that their food sucks.  Period.  We ordered the crispy creamy rock shrimp, the garganelli pasta with lobster, clams and peas and the chicken curry.  The rock shrimp were mediocre.  Not bad, but not good.  Somewhat soggy.  Our entrees, however, both sucked hardcore.  My pasta had a somewhat sweet flavor, and I felt like the lobster use was stingy in addition to being overcooked.  And, the pasta was not al dente at all-it was actually falling apart.  My friend's entree was straight up bad.  The curry was way to thin and liquidy, and the chicken was dry and overcooked.  We ended up sending that dish back, and the friendly busser told us that most customers don't like that dish in particular, in addition to my pasta as well.  She was surprised I didn't send the garganelli back too. I'd also like to mention that the bread bowl that I had been looking forward to all day was disappointing as well!  The old Simon had MUCH better, fresher bread varietals.  The pretzel bread was dry and stale, and all the other breads were \"eh\", and COLD.\n\nIn addition to the mediocre food, both me and my friend thought the attractive female bartender was rude and bitchy.  And, don't be fooled my friends, the Pineapple Mojito made with \"fresh pineapple\" is NOT actually made with fresh pineapple but canned pineapple juice.  Bleh.  I will mention that our server was extremely friendly and put up with my high maintenance bullshit very well.  Props to him.\n\nGo back to what you were doing before, Kerry Simon.  Cause this definitely 'aint an improvement.  Will not be back unless there are some mayjah changes with the menu."

            "review": "I would fly to Vegas just for Simon's bread basket and steamed veggies.  But I'm not like many of Vegas' visitors. I love high quality food served lovingly without preservatives, artificial flavors, or by women in hot shorts.  I want to eat food that's real in a place that inspires me.  --That's why every time I fly to Vegas, I eat at Simon.\n\nYou could eat healthy at Simon and walk away stuffed.  I'm not a steamed veggies fan, but Simon's vegetable basket is beautiful and divine; steamed vegetables penetrated by the aroma of lemongrass. A vegetable sushi roll was reasonably sized and stuffed with avacado, veggies, and a good hint of shiso.  The curries satisfy, as do the pumpkin soup and pizzas.  Plenty of dishes on the menu for everyone; vegetarians, vegans, meat-eaters, even the gluten-adverse could find food here.  And everything we ordered (over two nights) was delish.\n\nService was friendly, timely, and helpful.  At a server's suggestion, my friend ordered a blueberry blush martini, and I got my favorite, the brown sugar martini (with a hint of pineapple in it).  Neither were too sweet, just \"Omygod!\" amazing. \n\nDon't even get me started on the bread basket (which, if not warm, request it to be---they almost always serve it warm).  I've ordered a bread basket to go after eating there.\n\nFinally, you won't have room for dessert, but just eat it anyway.  From the gently glowing orb of cotton candy to the incredible milk shakes or brownies, Simon knows how to turn kiddo comfort foods into delightful desserts for adults.\n\nThe ambiance, the food, the service, they're all here at Simon, and it boggles my mind why previous posters couldn't see that when they visited.  Perhaps they'd be happier at Paris Hotel's \"Le Burger Brasserie and Grille.\""

I love the location, the view, the vegas atmosphere, and most of all - the service.\n\nThe bloody mary buffet bar AND all you can drink mimosas are major pluses. I've enjoyed every benedict on the menu and the \"white trash\" menu items AND the simon junk food are big favorites among my friends.\n\nFrosted Flakes French toast is my go-to fave.\n\nSimon's Sunday Brunch worth every penny."

            "review": "We went to Simon's with high expectations. We were celebrating a big business success with some friends. There were 8 of us. I'll keep this brief. We ordered drinks. The first 4 came in about 10 minutes. another 5 minutes 3 more came. Another 5 minutes the last drink, a ginger ale, came. Mind you it was a Monday evening and there were maybe 3 other tables with couples. The place was dead. (I guess that should have been an omen). So it took us 20 minutes in order to be able to toast our friends. By this time all we could talk about was how crappy the service was and how the staff simply did not give a damn.\n\nWe had to ask the waiter to take our order. We had to ask for water. We had to ask when the appetizers would come. We had to ask where was our food. Mind you, we are not speed eaters and understand the difference between eating and dining. But it was obvious the staff was more interested in catching up on gossip over the weekend than giving decent service. \n\nAs for the mood, we were so angry, who knows. \n\nAnd they had the gall to add 18% gratuity at the end. They simply suck suck suck."

We were treated horribly by 2 of the female employees.....1 being the bartender with the bad injectables, and the other being a brunette female server... Both were just plain old rude and acted like they were worth a bit more than we were even though they both are middle aged service workers.... \n\nAnyway, the food was decent, decor was awesome.... literally sitting right next to the pool deck.

It's kind of an elegant comfort food with Asian sushi kind of flair, I would guess, in a beautiful modern setting.  Seems to be an outstanding date or special occasion place, if that's what you are looking for."

As for breakfast, this may be the only choice unless you want the buffett or in room dining. I ended up having breakfast here and then met a customer right after for lunch. Breakfast was run of the mill - bacon and eggs. Lunch, was a french dip sandwich which was actually pretty good. \nThe ambiance is pretty cool - the whole restaurant overlooks a pool. I would guess that during hot weather and a busier time, this could turn out to be a cool place to people watch."

Simon at the Palms Place is great, it maintains some of Kerry's \"foods with a fun twist\" but he has managed to one up his old establisment in my opinion with more variety and a much much better facility with much better atmosphere, i always felt like I was in a closet at the Hard Rock but the Palms Place location is stunning. Prices are more than fair for the quality and quantity of food. I have fallen in love with some of their flatbread selections, I highly recomend trying one for an appitizer. I have eaten here several times the service is always great and last minute reservations are usually managable. Service is always excelent, the way it should be. If you are staying at the Palms or Palms Place I highly recomend Simon but if you are staying on \"the strip\" it might be a little off the beaten path for some."

Great view of a spectacular pool that is closed at 5pm and is visible from almost every table. Started with a Moscow Mule drink and a complimentary trio basket of bread. Normally I do an appetizer, but was in a bit of a time crunch with a show to go to. Moved onto ordering dinner. Ordered the meatloaf with wild barley risotto. The meatloaf was in the shape of two hockey pucks. The BBQ sauce had great flavor, but the meatloaf itself was bland. Really enjoyed the risotto. Also ordered the truffle oil mac n cheese and the braised short ribs with grits. Mac n cheese was so delicious! I found myself scraping the bowl for a last bite. The braised short ribs was a good sized portion of meat and very tender. The grits was a bit on the bland side, but I used the sauce from the short ribs for flavor. Want to try the Sunday brunch, but I was told this place is closing soon. Staff was very friendly and helpful!"

            "review": "Four of us went for a price fixed dinner @ $100 a head. The meal started with a bread basket which was excellent (I am sucker for pretzel bread). One of the appetizers was edamame. This was probably the best edamame I have ever eaten. My wife had a fish dish served with a side salad on the plate. The presentation was so unappealing I am surprised she ate it. I had the chicken curry. It was presented in a soup bowl with a lot of broth. The waiter pointed out that I would need a spoon. He disappeared and did not reappear. Nor was any other server in the area for over 10 minutes. I finally had to go to the bar and ask for a spoon. The server who tried to help me came back with the smallest teaspoon I had seen and a large apology. It was probably another 10 minutes before someone appeared with a tablespoon. We had mac and cheese as a side which was also excellent. The junk food dessert was a fun dish dominated by cotton candy (which I don't eat but was pretty and made for a good presentation).\nWhile some of the food was very tasty, the service was so poor (amongst other things, we couldn't get our water glass refilled!) that it made what should have been a special meal very unenjoyable. For $100 a head before tax and tip, they should do a lot better. With so many really good dining experiences in Vegas, why would I go back?"

The baguette was just so-so, but the Panini on pretzel bread....horrible\n\nstrike 1.....\n\ngot a couple items from the sweet section, including what appeared to be a pistachio macaroon, some caramel corn in a Chinese take out box, and the waiter brought us some pink cotton candy.  The candy corn was at least edible, but the green macaroon was actually mint flavor???? what an awful mouthful that was.  The cotton candy looked nice, but was not good in the least, so we left it as table d\u00e9cor....\n\nstrike 2....\n\nkitchen items arrived, we were looking forward to having something to eat....\nthe item of the day, the huervos rancheros was pretty bland, almost as if the cook had used no seasoning at all....basically very mild salsa on top of a crispy corn tortilla with an overdone egg on top....bit of black beans and pork sprinkled on plate too....should have passed on this.....\nhave to at least say the chicken was edible, and had some flavor. presented with an egg on top which was nice, and some spicy sauce on bottom\nthe French toast came out on the cold side, so maybe that would explain the bland texture and taste? was a bit overdone too....I prefer mine a lighter shade of brown and not the color of my coffee.....\n\nstrike 3\n\n......well that is 3 strikes, and we did decide to suffer a bit more and at least try a crepe....bad decision. we had the grilled vegetable and swiss cheese one, and watched as the cook took a crepe off a stack of premade ones and threw on induction pan to heat up, throwing the vegetables and cheese on top to warm.\nAWFUL....for the price we paid, would it really have been out of line to expect them to make a crepe to order???? it's not the hardest thing to do now\n\nstrike 4????\n\nso aside from the 1 edible kitchen dish (chicken) and the candy corn, we both did enjoy their coffee. the orange juice was good too, although it was so busy (HAHA) that we had to ask the waiter more than once for 1 simple glass\n\nOne other thing that bothered me more than my companion was the fact that the waiter seemed to not really give a sh*t at all. My friend is a server at another venue and says it wasn't his fault the food was so bad which I do understand. but when he picks up every plate and it is very apparent we did not eat anything at all, an apology or something would have been nice...to show he at least cared?\nwell I guess you can only take negative comments so long before you become numb to the job.....\n\nI hope they take these comments to heart and try to implement some changes.  It is pretty hard to justify those prices for a simple brunch menu with low quality. The setting and atmosphere made me want to like this place, but the food and service makes a return visit so NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!"

I would rather go to other places on the strip that are just as expensive, if not less, with better service and better food. The warm brunch menu food at Simon's is yummy yet fatty.

Normally, I would have rated this place 5-stars, but took away one because the service was a bit slow the last 3 times I visited.\n\nI can't say enough about the food.  Simon provides the most extensive menu from the more traditional brunch favorites to the most imaginative. I love the Lobster Brioche and the M&M pancakes!  They also feature a candy bar for dessert with a wide selection of delectable sweets to top off your meal.  Sample Simon's special \"Junk Food Plate\" that comes with homemade snowballs, Rice Krispies treats, homemade Hostess cupcakes, chocolate chip cookies and cotton candy!  It's definitely not for the faint of heart and serious health freaks, but you only live once, right? \n\nAnd, what Sunday Brunch wouldn't be complete without beverages!  For an additional charge, you have your choice of \"bottomless\" beer, all-you-can-drink Mimosas or Bellini's, or make-your-own Bloody Mary's.  Need to recover from too much partying the night before?  They've got you covered!  Just roll by the \"Hangover Bar\" where you'll find baskets of Advil, Tums, and Pepto Bismol!"

They staff was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. The bread was incredible and the meal- equally enjoyable. The prices are also unbeatable for everything you'd receive from a Vegas dining experience. Also the food is very freshly prepared w gluten-free and organic options! I will definitely be back here! Yum!!!! Wish they had one in Ca. P.s. Got a complimentary huge ball of house made cotton candy. Fun :)"

All the servers wear pajamas and guests are encouraged to wear theirs (and actual warm and fuzzy pjs, not sexy Vegas lingerie). \n\nAnd you get bottomless beer, and/or mimosas, and/or bellinis, and/or make-your-own bloody marys. Personally, I'm not a fan of bloody marys, but I love them here. I enjoy playing around with the different vodkas, salts, veggies, fruits, and hot sauces. Oh so many hot sauces!\n\nThe actual food offerings are great too - and fun! The buffet / grab it yourself offerings are everything from dirt cups to sushi rolls to crepes to jumbo shrimp. The menu items, which are made just for you and brought to your table, are everything from breakfast pizza to lobster brioche to french toast to M&M pancakes. And then, of course, there's all the junk food platter and all the candy bowls. It's just such a fun place and environment!\n\nThe restaurant itself has floor to ceiling windows and sits right by the pool, so it's a nice view."

The food was ok at best but not great and not nearly what I expected as far as quality and selection. The restaurant is beautiful and has a great view of the pool. Our service was pretty good but a little slow and the she forgot several items. I was disappointed that we had to remind her several times with each item we ordered and refills on champagne, especially considering that the place was virtually empty. The only reason I have them 2 stars is that the server was friendly and very nice although a little scattered."

There were some pros and cons, but the food totally made it worth it. \n\nFirst of all, we got there around 6:30 on a Monday night and were told that because we didn't have reservations, we would be seated at a high top at the bar. We were a little confused because the restaurant was dead, but shrugged it off and figured it would get busy later. It never did. It remained mostly empty for the next two hours.\n\nWe all ordered the pop rocks martini and it was to die for, very unique and not too sweet. We ended up ordering a sushi roll and side each and putting them all in the center of the table, family style, and sampling each others selections. This is definitely the best way to go. We ordered three sushi rolls, which were rather forgettable and I can't even remember their names. But the sides were exceptional. Truffled mac and cheese, tempura Brussels sprouts, and wasabi mashed potatoes. Holy cow. I can't even decide which one was my favorite.\n\nThe waitress was very sweet, she even brought us a complementary plate of cotton candy before we left and was kind enough to split the tab. It wasn't even as expensive as I thought it was going to be, another definite plus. Give this place a try if you have the time!"

Ideal for the recovering alcoholic you thought you'd never be from the night before. \n\nYes, it is a buffet brunch - with a few exceptions. Everything on the menu can be ordered, directly to the table, a la carte. And we did just that. From a beautifully baked vegetable quiche to numerous versions of French toasts and omelettes, the variety here is simply astounding. Portions aren't so bad either. For some of us, that means letting the belt down a few notches. \n\nAs mentioned by many others, the buffet is set up into different stations. Here you can personalize your own crepes, smoothies and sushi platter. It is simply the best made-to-order, buffet food you could get. \n\nService is very personable, fun and relaxing. On Sundays, all the waiting staff wear their jammies. So feel free to let loose in yours too! I wasn't so daring, but I made sure to come in my cozy, wooly sweater and tight, Zack Morris jeans. It's important to look good whenever you're at a swanky, brunch place like this."

At $38 its expensive for brunch but if you think about how much you would have to pay to eat say an eggs benedict (probably $15) then its actually a decent price.  Since I love eggs, the lobster harvarti benedict and pulled pork benedict stick out to me.  The lobster harvarti with egg yolk oozing all over.... ahhhh.  The pulled pork was tangy with the bbq sauce.  The french toast was simply the greatest thing ever!  Only disappointment was the chicken and waffles.... it was chicken and waffles.... nothing special.  There is also the sushi bar which was surprisingly good and the peel and eat shrimp was surprisingly plump.  A semi disappointment was the juice bar.  I thought there would be lots of different smoothies and such but there were only 3 choices.  A decent berry smoothie, a green machine which although healthy is made of wheat grass which makes it kinda bitter, and a not too appetizing beet cocktail.  I would recommend if spending $38 for brunch is within your range."

Not here.\n\nWe sampled over 8 main courses on the menu. All of them were very sub par and cooked/prepared poorly. The service was slow, we could never get refills despite having 3 servers dedicated to our room. Half of the dishes were cold by the time they delivered them. The decor was cheesy and poorly done. A futile attempt at class and modern sophistication designed bya high school level idiot. They have a pool just outside on the patio, doesnt quite make sense to me but whatever.  And to top it off I got a look at the check, way overpriced for bad food and service.\n\nOk Im a big dessert fan. I judge restaurants by their desserts.  So when we get finished with the crappy food. I figure, at least some sugary treat will improve my opinion of the place. These jokers bring out a tray full of cotton candy, rice-krispy treats, stale donuts, and hot pink sno-balls. Artery clogging shit I could buy at 7-11.  Not one hand made goody on the plate. \n\nThe only good thing about the place was the hostess and her impressive cleavage. Even this isnt enough to get me to return for seconds. Simon is soon to be a Vegas dive bar and will likely disappear in a year or two."

            "review": "Extremely slow, sloppy service, majority of food was pretty mediocre especially when factoring in the high prices. I was here twice due to a friend's birthday, so this review is based on a dinner in the private dining room for about 40ppl and also their Sunday brunch for 16ppl.\nThe palms place valet was full they said because they're sponsoring the ufc fight that night. The fight was in Brazil, so I don't really get it... I had to self park and haul my presents, balloons and other stuff, so an awesome start.  \n\nThe private dining room was great, glass enclosed overlooking the lighted pool area and the main dining room. They had 4 big round tables that comfortably seated about 10. Although there was enough waitstaff filling waters, there was only 1 waiter or bartender taking drink orders. That meant waiting for about 15min till he acknowledged me, then another 20 till drinks actually arrived. I saw the other waiters at brunch the next day, so I know they're all capable of taking drink orders. In addition to being slow, the guy also seemed bored like he didn't want to be there. Maybe the built in gratuity had something to do with it, but don't stand there with a pissy face all night. \n\nThe courses came out timed pretty well. I guess they do their private dining family style, which just seems lazy to me. The tables are too big, plates are too big and heavy for a family style dinner to make sense. There's no lazy Susan like at Chinese restaurants. \n\nThe chefs and/or waiters also can't count because we were shorted on some of the food. Not everyone got a piece of chicken (I got a little drumstick) and I don't really count a 2\" square of steamed salmon as an ok portion. Dessert was good, but again they were really cheap with the portion. Since dinner is charged per person, they should in theory have enough of each item for each person right? Not at Simon. At Simon, 9 people get a bowl of cotton candy, 4 snowballs, 4 (mini) hostess cupcakes, 4 brownies, 4 rice crispy treats, 2 little containers of carmel corn and 6 cookies. Makes sense right? Right..\n\nI don't even want to know what my friend spent on dinner because I'm sure it would make me sick. Nobody wants to say anything (and he's not on yelp), but he got ripped off big time. It wasn't just the portion - quality was lacking as well. Only thing that stood out were the charred edamame. Meatloaf was good but dry, chicken was good but no clue what the little black things on the side were. \n\nOn to Sunday brunch the following day. Our waiter was nice but seemed overwhelmed. He seemed to be hustling, but the kitchen was slow as hell. With such a limited brunch menu, things should've flown out the kitchen. We were waiting 20-30 minutes for our orders, which is unacceptable. All they had to do for a benedict is poach an egg then assemble it, everything else should've already been made. They're also really slow to clear.\n\nI ordered a ham panini and toasted bagel. There were 3ppl waiting so I went to get sushi which is 2 feet away. That @sshole gave my stuff to someone else, didn't apologize or anything. The ham and cheese on pretzel bread was inedible - there was so much salt on the bread its the only thing you could taste. Bagel was a bagel, can't eff that up. \nReally good, fresh sushi but really limited options - spicy tuna, but no tuna sashimi or nigiri. The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good but not at all spicy. Pastry and dessert selection was limited and nothing was note worthy. They also had smoothies and cocktail shrimp. I don't like that it was peel and eat - for $40/person they couldn't just buy peeled shrimp? \n\nBreakfast pizza, pulled pork benny on jalapeno cornbread and the cornflake french toast were awesome. The flavors of the pork benny went perfectly together and i love that the middle of the french toast was custardy. 10x better than babycakes' cornflake french toast. Chicken and waffles featured a tasteless chicken finger with your standard waffle, \"lobster\" benny was also a big fail. No joke, the only lobster piece that I found was a sliver less than 1/2 cm big. Crepes sit in a pile, not made fresh to order.\n\nMimosas were good, but our glasses sat empty way too often. So at a total of $57 if you opt for unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's or Bellini's this brunch was a little pricey. If you like Sunday brunch with made to order entrees vs buffet I highly recommend Republic Kitchen at half the price, way better service and better food. Its not on the strip, but hey neither is Simon.\n\nI noticed most of the reviews I read mentioned they had either a travel zoo coupon or dining credit from staying at palms place. A good restaurant shouldn't have to rely on promos like that to fill the dining room. It still wasn't full on a Saturday night btw, but brunch was busy. \n\nMy friend was drunk and too busy jumping between tables to realize the issues with dinner. But I will be sure to encourage him to go somewhere else with his money for next years"

Simon's is an elegant and understated restaurant with a view onto the pool of the Palm's Place.  There is a serenity here that makes the amazing food that much better to enjoy.\n\nStaff is EXCELLENT, decor oh yes and the food, OMG the food is sooooo good.  Menu can change, my two favorites are the Rock Shrimp off of the appetizer menu and the Truffle Mac n Cheese with Lobster.  DAMN this is good.\n\nThere is a sushi menu and on Sundays they have Pajama Brunch so much food to choose from.  There is also a beautiful bar area that you can sit have a drink and a quick bite if you didn't want to do the whole dinner.\n\nWe loved this place so much we came to it 4 times in one weekend.  We were staying at the Palms Place so that was a factor but point is we were never tired of it.\n\nLook forward to a fun end to your meal, I won't spoil the surprise.  : )"

            "review": "We were here for a friend's birthday dinner. The venue is inviting from the moment we walked in. The host sat us at the bar, since our whole party was not yet there. The bartender was very nice, and she comped our birthday shots (which were like 10 of us at the moment). I highly recommend their Pomrock martini (This is a modified pomegranate martini). Once we sat down, our orders were taken promptly. The noise level was quiet when we arrived, and increased a bit as the restaurant became busier. It never became a problem, though.\n\nI did not order much, since I had eaten not that long prior to dinner. But my boyfriend ordered the calamari and a salad. Also, their starter breads are amazing. They offered mini muffins and scones (which were not overwhelmingly sweet). \n\nI ordered the lobster Miso soup, and my boyfriend ordered the Italian pizza. This was probably the best miso soup I have ever had, but it can also set you back $10 (considering that many restaurants offer regular miso soup for free with your meal). The Italian pizza was ok. It was not bad, but it also didn't truly justify the price. HOWEVER, one of our friends had the filet steaks (which are prime cuts). It was very tender and perfectly prepared, based on the two bites I had. The filet steak price was fairly reasonable for the food quality (as well as considering it was at the Palms Place). In case anyone is a sushi fan, they also have sushi made to order.\n\nFor dessert, they brought us a plethora of items! Also, because it was a birthday dinner, they brought us two massive bowls of cotton candy. The dessert trays were amazing. And for anyone who reads my yelps, I am a big fan of dessert. For me... if a venue can offer great dessert... I AM A FAN. From the dessert tray, the cookies were so moist and delicious and the rice krispies were so light. There were other items, but of course we all have to share.\n\nTo end dinner, Chef Simon actually came out and introduced himself to us. I had not had that yet at any of the 'high-end' establishments we had gone. I would come back again, and maybe try more than just the Miso soup and pizza."

My friend pointed out that Simon had a happy hour from 4-7 so we decided to check it out since it was right there.  It was one of the best decisions I ever made.  Happy hour included appetizers and drinks for $6 and the food was scrumptious!  I had the pizza, edamame, salad, baked California rolls and the meatball sliders all over the course of three days!  Yup we kept coming back and Rebecca is the best server.  \n\nSimon would get 5 stars for their greatness, but the complimentary breakfast service is HORRIBLE.  How long does it take to bring out a pastry plate that should already be prepared snce several people come for the breakfast?  We waited 20 minutes for that plate and then we were ignored by our waitress and even the manager.  So be aware when you go that you may have to wait.  Happy hour is a must!"

Which is really a shame because I loved staying at the palms place and the front desk service was phenomenal. When me and my group got to the restaurant the hostess sat us and it wasn't busy. After about 20 min the waiter came and got our drink order and walked off. I overheard the table behind us talking about how poor the service was and how they should leave. The waiter then goes and talks with a female co worker for ten minutes before coming back to re take out order because he didn't write it down and thought he could remember it...apparently too difficult. So we sit and wait another 15-20 and notice tables around looking irritable and one gets up and leaves. I try to wave the waiter over and he ignores it...we get up and leave and never even got our drinks in the hour we were there. Will not recommend to anyone."

            "review": "Let me start by saying I used to like this place. I've been eating at Simon a couple times a year since it was at the Hard Rock. Secondly I am one of the easiest people to wait on in the world. As I am a server myself and have worked just about every position in a restaurant. I've noticed a steady decline in the service and the quality of the food since relocating to Palms Place. In any case I found myself dinning at the bar with a friend of mine on a Tuesday night. Whom also has spent most of his life in the industry.  We had established a  rapport with one of the bartenders earlier in the day as with sipped our bloodymarys to nurse the previous nights antics. So we came back for dinner and decided to sit with her rather than dine at a table. As it turns out she was no longer working the double she had mentioned earlier and was on her way out.  So we two new bartenders(no big deal). We proceeded to order three courses. The first being the Tuna Tatar and Sweet Onion Dip with Cracked Black Pepper Chips. Both perfect in presentation but lacking almost complete of salt. So half way through the onion dip having never even touched the Tuna our salads arrive. So it became very clear at this point the young lady now attending us had no concept of timing. My drink ran dry at this point as well. So we stopped our friend from earlier and  asked her to relay the message \"We're gonna be here all night, just wanna have leisurely dinner very slow and low. Please don't fire the steaks until we say. My friend would like to take a break in between to go have a smoke and maybe a drink then eat our entr\u00e9es.\" \n  So this is where it really went south. She then returns a few moments later and says your steaks have already been fired you got about 15min, \"is that ok?\" Mind you we now have four plates of food sitting in front of us. I replied definitely not ok please tell them to take the steaks off the grill and don't fire until I ask. She says ok and then says good bye she's heading home. I trusted that this message had been relayed. By now my drink has been empty for 10-15min with no sign of replenishment. So finally flag down our bartender who's literally been three feet away the whole time and ask for a Basil Hayden old-fashion. Up or on the rocks she asks. I reply rocks as I'm pretty certain an old fashion is never served up. But I'm thinking maybe Simon is playing with cocktails now not just food. Anyhow she grabs the Makers and I stop her to remind her I said Basil. She proceeds to muddle, shake, and strain into a martini glass. I smile and drink without comment at this point I'm feeling bad and don't wanna say anything more. \n  We finish our apps and move onto salads. A third friend joins us for a drink and a bite. She too works in a restaurant just acrossed the lot at Palms. She promply orders a glass of wine and a sushi roll. About two bites into my salad and here comes the steaks! Now I'm officially pissed. Not only this, but the runner is trying to clear my salad. I tell him to set the steak to the side so I can finish. Now me and my original friend are both irate. He finishes his salad quickly and says he's going for a smoke. I follow suite and move on to my steak, ordered MR and is clearly leaning toward MW. Still feeling bad say nothing. Friend A returns friend B finishes 1st glass of wine still no sushi. It's at this point it's just ridiculous. Friend A does't have a fork to eat his now cold steak. having been no check back it takes us literally about 20-30min to finally just wave down the bartender from the other end of the bar to procure a fork. Now he's pissed and just says you know what I don't even want it. And exits to the restroom. At the same time I ask the bartender with the fork to check on the sushi roll as it too has taken close to 30min and she replies everything is taking a long time tonight. Which in my mind is hilarious as we couldn't get them to slow down. \n  So friend A sees Kerry Simon in route to the restroom and stops him. He explains that he hates to complain and also works in a restaurant, but this is what's going on. To which Kerry replies with a straight face, and I quote \"Maybe you should've sat in the dinning room if you where having dinner. Our bar can be a little sketchy sometimes.\" WHAT!!!?? \n  A couple more things transpired including another old-fashion in a martini glass. But this is already long winded. In the end this was my single worst dining experience of which I have many, in my entire life. It saddens me to think this because I wanted to have a good time and in the end it sort I sorta did in a twisted way. So long Simon was good run but  will never happen again."

I had a crispy rice with spicy tuna for my first time and Simon's has been my favorite place to have it so far. Their miso soup display is very neat. The junk food platter is super cute and one order is enough for four people!\n\nIf you don't like what's already out on the buffet, you can order dishes from your server and they make it pretty quick.

I was shocked to find that I had never written an intial review even after all my visits, so here we go.\n\nI have been a few times for dinner as well as the weekend brunch and I can say I like quite a bit here. The brunch is fantastic. The service was great and I remember the waiter being very attentive and helpful in getting the right combination of all the dishes we wanted to try without ordering too much or too little. This was a hard balance to find with a group as large as ours. The lobster benedict, french toast and smoothies were standouts with me, but everything was fabulous. Splurge and get the upgraded all you can drink package as well. If only they would serve you at your table instead of forcing people to stand in a long line for an alcoholic beverage. I hate wasting my buffet time in line.\n\nFor dinner, I'm a huge fan as well. The shishito peppers are divine. Perfectly seasoned and just yum, yum and more yum. The braised shortribs were perfectly cooked and seasoned. You can't go wrong with many of the dishes on the menu here. \n\nIt's a must that you order one of their signature junk food desserts. They have lots of  sweets to choose from, so pick carefully...or just get the sampler.\n\nI'll be back and I look forward to going into more detail about my favorite dishes here."

I'm impressed that the host didn't try to hide us in a corner to keep us out of the way.\n\nWe were grateful our server was patient, understanding and knowledgable.\n\nI ordered the Steak and eggs for breakfast and that was awesome.\n\nEgg White Fritata was filling and tasty.\n\nBelgian Waffle with Blueberry Compote was sufficiently fluffy and crunchy on the outside.\n\nThe restaurant has a fantastic view of the awesome pool and cabanas. It also has access to said pool and cabanas which was very convenient for us to burn off the children's energy while waiting for dishes to arrive.\n\nLooks like it could be a very \"sexy\" place to have dinner with a date."

I despise spicy tuna (I hate spicy things and hate mayo) so imagine my surprise when a *spicy* tuna handroll shows up. I explain to the waiter the menu says just tuna so I'd like a tuna handroll. He refuses, says I'm wrong, the menu says \"spicy\" and walks away. I have to freaking go grab a menu , show him the words \"tuna hand roll\" , and ask again for a new handroll before he goes and grabs me another one. UGH\n\nBesides the service, the food is just BLAH. Bland, expensive. I'm into the whole foo-foo lunch thing, but honestly Society Cafe at Encore does the whole concept far better. The surf and turf tacos for $17 are TINY. I got a filet mignon cobb salad today for $18. I order my steak medium rare. The salad is so sad looking and imagine my disappointment to find my \"filet mignon\" is 2 ounces or so of grizzly, tough, dark brown \"steak\". Hardly a filet mignon, definitely not medium rare, and for sure 2 ounces of steak over greens for $18 is a ripoff. The sushi is a step above grocery store sushi - yup, that's the best I can say for it. \n\nRant over . Space is still beautiful but service & food continue to go downhill."

I was attempting to get us to Max Brenner at Ceasers's Palace, but traffic was horrendous and we missed our reservation. Probably my fault considering I didn't take into account getting off on Flamingo would be such a cluster-F. Which then we ended up trying to back-track by getting off on Tropicana, and dun dun dun.... so the story goes of the local girl who doesn't realize just how horrible the Strip can be on a holiday weekend. Lesson learned.\n\nSo I said what the heck, there's The Palms, let's just try to eat somewhere there. We arrived at Simon after I called and asked what their dress code was, since my husband was dressed in jeans and nice tennis shoes. Biz casual. Good to go. We sat at the bar, because we were the couple without reservations on V-Day. \n\nI was in a not-so-great mood, but the yummy drink with Pop-Rocks the bartender made me feel better! My husband opted for Fat Tire. We dined on their \"special\" menu for that night. We ordered an app of grilled spicy edamame, very good, with a very distinct spice and lime flavoring. We both got the filet mignon ($38 - and well worth it!), medium rare, with mushrooms, comes with a wine reduction sauce and something like a garlic aioli. The filet was great, tender, and melt-in-your-mouth. We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes to share. Yikes. They were SO SALTY. I couldn't even stomach them.\n\nService was so-so, the bar was full, but I was left without a drink on more than one occasion and my husband too. \n\nOverall, bar service and food were 4 stars. I wouldn't go with a 5 because of the offending salty mashed potatoes."

            "review": "Have I ever mentioned how much I adore brunch? I love brunch. I love leisurely weekend mornings where it's socially acceptable to drink alcohol and stuff your face full of delicious rich foods and then sleep it all off afterwards. Simon offers up one of these brunches--the kind that you feel like you need to go on a juice cleanse after...and lucky for you, they offer juice-cleanse level juice. \n\nSimon 's brunch is a strange one, but it is delicious all the same. It is a mixture of buffet style and all you can eat small plates, which makes it a somewhat confusing experience. They could probably do away with the buffet-style portion and just do the small plates and make it easier, but then you wouldn't get the experience of watching crepes be assembled. (Assembled is the right word here--there is no crepe griddle or any real options for them other than the one Nutella/banana one. Still good, I mean, it has got Nutella, but it's not prime crepe time.)\n\nStandouts on the menu include the biscuit and gravy, French toast, blue cheese/fig crostini, pizzas, and cotton candy. The egg dishes leave a bit to desire--it's much more a sweet brunch than a savory one.\n\nThe pajamas are cute, but I have to wonder if this is the last endorsement deal that Paul Frank ever got. I liked that monkey as much as anyone--15 years ago in middle school. Perhaps an update would make this place feel less tired like some reviews have mentioned."

Decor was eclectic, loved all the windows and how bright it was with natural light coming through. It was kinda chilly out so only a couple brave people in the pool. We were greeted immediately by our server and offered all you can drink mimosas, bellini's or bloody mary's for $17. This is average price and also I think it's well worth it. So I agreed. As I'm drinking my first glass, she then tells me to get the $17 all you can drink you have to get the $40 brunch buffet. Huh? Why? That doesn't make any sense at all. I'm not a all you can eat type I person, I prefer to order one plate and enjoy what I ordered, not over eat on massive amounts of food. So I was a little upset I was being forced into the brunch buffet. \n\nI ordered the crunchy french toast to share, it was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of \"the fortress\" our server recommended. It was fried Mac n cheese on the bottom loaded with pulled pork, an egg. It was sitting in a pool of grease. Barf. I pretty much stuck with the baguette station, I liked the blu cheese and fig and the pecorino and honey comb, oh an the banana nutella crepe. So I pretty much paid $40 for snacks. \n\nWell the bellini's were good, and my company was excellent. Overall I enjoyed my brunch, but I wouldn't go back after paying $65. I will stick to DW Bistro or First Food & Bar. I can get my all you can drink mimosas and just order a plate of something."

That is when I decided Sunday brunch at Simon's would be a perfect new experience! I made reservations on Open Table three weeks prior (first time doing so...very easy). We arrived at Simon's right on time for our 12:30 reservation and we were told that it would be a few extra minutes until our table was ready. We didn't mind because we figured its pretty difficult to facilitate reservation times for an all you can eat buffet. After all, we were a party of two and we ended up staying for 2 hours! We finally were sat about ten minutes later by the hostess decked out in a men's dress shirt and high heels (adorable!). It was really crowded and a bit loud. The weather was terrible that day so I would imagine that normally they have the sliding doors wide open and it isn't as loud. \nOur server was pleasant (and wearing PJ's) and showed us the menu we could order off of in addition to the items on the buffet line. She took our  drink order. I decided to get the all you can drink mimosas ($16). I was a little disappointed when she said they were out of Bellini's that day. My fiance ordered the all you can drink bloody marys ($7) from the bloody mary bar. After our drink arrived I went to the buffet and the chef cut a huge plate of mixed fresh, juicy fruit up for me. Very fresh...enough for the two of us and we picked at the fruit plate the entire meal. The chef also made me a fresh fruit smoothie...so delicious! We ordered from the menu the french toast and the chicken and waffles first. Loved the french toast!! It turned out to be my favorite thing we ate that day....so sweet...and encrusted in corn flakes. The waffles were good too and my fiance enjoyed the chicken. My fiance then went up to the panini buffet and had a homemade panini made....good nothing crazy though. We then ordered from the menu the ribs from the \"white trash\" section of the menu...and a margherita pizza (we were there for two hours, OK! its a buffet...you have to pig out!) The pizza was very good. And after all was said and done....our dessert arrived....THE JUNK FOOD PLATTER!! Amazing!!! cotton candy, caramel popcorn, rice krispy treats, cookies, coconut puffs, brownie....yummy!\nThe whole experience was awesome and we can't for another special occasion to go back. (oh yes...its pricey for breakfast....$38 per person plus drinks) It was worth it! Looking back there are so many more things that were offered on both the buffet and the menu that I would like to try, I just didn't have room for it all that day!"

It was initially difficult for us to find, but once we found it we enjoyed the laid back, semi-trendy atmosphere of the restaurant. \n\nWhen we first arrived we were told that because we didn't have a reservation the only seating available was at the bar. This was a little odd, since only about 20% of the tables had diners at them, but whatever, a table at the bar was fine. \n\nOverall, the food was fantastic. The spanish octopus was a little bit tough, but the sauce that went with it was amazing. The ahi tuna entree was perfect and my fiance raved about his rigatoni. The only dish that we didn't love was the truffled macaroni- the taste of truffle oil was so over powering we weren't able to finish the dish. Which was disappointing because it looked amazing, and would have been much better minus the truffle oil all together. \n\nWe also got the lemon ricotta cheese cake and chocolate pudding cake for dessert, both of which were excellent. They also offer a cotton candy and junk food platter, which I think is a little gross, and I'm not sure why anyone would order food you can get from a county fair or 7-11 at a nice restaurant, but apparently it is really popular. \n\nOverall, I had a really nice dining experience. I'm not sure that I would go out of my way to come back, but if I was ever in the Palms again for a movie or something, or if I had guests in town staying at the hotel, I would recommend Simon."

First, it overlooks the Palms Place pool which is small and quite ugly - the lawn chairs are stained and just look so dirty. Also, we were first seated at a booth which had huge rips in the seams and the stuffing was coming out. In Vegas, especially when you are situated among the best restaurants in the world, ambiance and decor are a big part of the experience and equally as important as the food. I just don't see how a restaurant can justify not fixing issues such as seating which is falling apart.  It really grossed me out."

The waiter already had water waiting and some limes and lemons on the table, i wish more place would do that. He offer me other drink options but I just stayed with water. After everyone showed up he went through the menu with us. One side was what the buffet offered which included sushi rolls, paninis, bagels, fruit, shrimp, crepes, and smoothies. The other side was from the kitchen which included pizzas, benedicts, and my favorite the white trash. With brunch you pay 39.50 and get to order from either side. We were a little confused at first but figured out we were not being punked. All of food for 39.50, eat it now!!! So, first we orders some items from the kitchen and then go up and cruised the buffet area. I grab some pineapple, muffins, sushi, and bagels. I also ordered a panini. Headed back to the table with almost a full plate. What have I gotten myself into?!?! The sushi was delicious. My favorite was the crispy rice and avocado roll. They also had other option like spicy tuna, California, and shrimp. I also like the blueberry loaf they had out, it was moist and delicious. The panini i ordered was the honeycomb baguette, it was interesting. i think i should have gone with a crepe. After I demolished the buffet stuff our orders from the kitchen started coming out. My first and favorite dish of the day was the chicken fried chicken. Just like chicken fried steak but it was chicken with gravy and an egg on top. The chicken was deliciously seasoned and just enough. My friend ordered a pizza, it was okay. Not something i would come back for. We also ordered waffles, pancakes, french toast and even some egg Benedict with pulled pork. Everything came out pretty quickly. Near the end we ordered some ribs and they were layered with bbq sauce which was awesome. Then we were finishing up and he brought us COTTON CANDY!!! We demolished the first cup and then had him bring more. He brought 3 more and we were then playing with it and make cotton candy mustaches and even dipping it in our drinks. We had too much fun for brunch. So my recommendation are the crispy rice, chicken fried chicken, and cotton candy. Also, my apologies for no good pictures. The food was inhaled."

I think they guarantee them in 30 minutes, if you are in a rush. I had the bento box ($20), which was a California roll, seaweed salad, and crispy rice spicy tuna (roll? not quite sure what this was).  The dessert that came with it was 3 mochi.  That's a lot of food!  Anyway, the California roll was pretty good.  For being a California roll, it was pretty tasty.  The seaweed salad was also quite good.  The crispy rice spicy tuna thing was lacking.  Really chewy, not a lot of flavor.  I regret even eating it.\n\nI think they also have a lunch combo with some sliders, fries, and dessert... and one other lunch combo.

Paprika has no business on a taco. I've had better canned salsa. 3. I made the mistake of ordering dessert, it was the peanut butter candy bar. Again, bad. There was no peanut butter, there wasn't even really sweetness. Honestly, I am pretty easily pleased especially when peanut butter, tacos are involved! How do you mess that up?!"

I love the fireplace area!!\nEven when we where low on cash my friend and I would come in an just order the french fries (best french fries ever!) Order them with truffle sauce it makes all the difference! Also the shrimp cocktail was one of our favorite just for a snack before going out on the town or whatever.\nFor dinner-I highly recommend the lamb porterhouse, the bison (if they have it sense it's special), or the bamboo steamed fish (which we always ask for halibut and I personally don't care for bok choy so I get spinach instead). They have a new drink there that is SO good I forgot the name but it's a martini which I asked for on the rocks- but was really tangy and delicious! \nThe beef carpaccio is one of the best I've ever had! Endive Salad is really good, I love the point reyes blue cheese! \nAs far as desserts go I know they almost always have special desserts- I'll post a few pictures. One the I really loved and sounded strange at first but was so savory-sweet... was the a caramel popcorn icecream. Not sure if they'll have it as a staple but I hope so! The cotton candy is free and fun to eat with friends, goes to show Kerry Simon has a great sense of humor. \nOkay one more lovely thing to say- the sushi is also really great and the bar is ultra romantic, great idea for a date night... I'll post some pictures of that as well!"

And here are a few of the things I loved best:\n\na) Fruit/smoothie bar, where you can get a bowl of all the fruit you want in the exact proportions you want.\nb) Crepe/panini bar, the mere notion of which set my hear aflutter.  They desperately need more varieties, though.  The choices are very limited.\nc) A fab sushi chef made excellent veggie rolls, which somehow went really well with the breakfast food.\nd) You can order anything you want off the brunch menu, too.  For some in my party, this meant chix and waffles or spare ribs, but for me it meant PERFECT FRENCH TOAST.  Seriously, this frosted-flake French toast might be the best I've ever had, except for maybe my mom's.\nd) Drinks are unlimited.  This may make for very tipsy shopping, gambling or go karting, whatever's next on your agenda.\ne) They cap it off with dessert.  DESSERT!  After you've eaten your fruit and crepe and French toast, they still bring out dessert!  And you still eat it!\n\nI swear, three days later I'm still full and happy.\n\nIt's not cheap - brunch, drink and tip came out to about $70 per person - but it's worth it.\n\nThey handled our group of 16 easily.\n\nKerry Simon was actually in the house when we were there, answering his own phone at the host desk.

Had the filet mignon, pork chops and went numerous times during our 4 day stay there.  The meat was cooked perfectly & juicy.  The added sauce accented the flavor of the meat enough not to cover it.  Breakfast was great except they didn't have sugar free syrup for diabetics.  Wanted to try their pancakes really bad.  Dinner there was what we love in a restaurant; friendly bartenders, servers and a great menu (chef).  The combination of great service and great food will make us come back. Kerry came out to talk to us and delighted us with his personality.  The Palms was perfect for us being we don't like the LV strip.  Highly recommend going their for food, fun and a wonderful time!

I would not recommend that you go out of your way from the strip to come here for brunch, but if you are staying at the Palms, this is definitely the place to go for. I love how this place is located right next to the pool. It's just beautiful. \nI've only been here for brunch, so I can't speak entirely for the restaurant, but the food is good. It is not amazing, excellent, but good. They have the usual breakfast, but definitely with a more health conscious choice. We ordered the yogurt parfait and the berry smoothie, and they were definitely fresh and tasty. I ordered egg white omelette with mushroom, cheese, pepper and specifically asked it to be not too greasy. It came perfectly as I asked, and that was great. But, I must say that the food is just mediocre. It was just like any other breakfast place with a nice atmosphere."

They all had the same response - Simon was their favorite food experience of the trip and this is the one place they wanted to come back on subsequent trips.\n\nFor hair of the dog - they offer a Bloody Mary bar and bottomless mimosas.\n\nFor brunch - they serve a la cart menu items as well as buffet-style stations with healthy options ranging from wheat grass shots to sushi.\n\nThe wait staff dresses in pajamas and they are always delightful to talk with in a post-party hungover state.\n\nWhen your hangover is slightly cured, be sure to splurge and try their desert tray... they are kinda famous for it. It's an awesome platter of carnival-worthy delights presented with a tower of cotton candy.\n\nAs an added bonus, you have access to the adjacent pool lounge until the late afternoon - a great place to chill and relax whilst recovering from your food coma. My rec - take your bottomless mimosa to-go style and soak in some rays by the pool. You'll feel good as new for another night out!\n\n\n\nDinner at Simon is fantastic too, but brunch is definitely my preferred experience."

I like how they encourage even the customers to come wearing pajamas.  We opted not to but we definitely will next time. \n\nTo say I went over the top with the food is an understatement.  The fullest I have ever felt in my life and believe me when I say I can be a ridiculously gluttonous pig.  Even my wife who eats with me everyday was taken a back.  I was out of control. \n\nI did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. \n\nThe sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.\n\nThe juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.\n\nAnd on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  \n\n4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  \n\nBreakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  \n\nYou've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!"

It continues to be a hidden spot in Las Vegas that actually takes some effort to go rather than being one of those places right off the casino floor. Because of where it is located, there are no slot machines pinging in the background either. It is a really nice escape from the usual Las Vegas atmosphere. They actually have a Happy Hour with good specials on both drinks and food and I continue to find the customer service to be excellent. Courtney especially is a wonderful server and her smile alone will make you forget that the Chargers blew a 21 point lead and cost you money. No, I'm not bitter at all...just keep bringing that delicious pretzel bread before my meal. Thank you."

We also had a wonderful bottle of Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara County, recommended by the sommelier. Unforgettable sushi, tender steak entrees, and for dessert - what I will always remember as an \"amusement park on a platter\" - cookies, rice krispy treats, cupcakes, brownies, cotton candy, caramel popcorn, vanilla latte, on and on in a whirl of happiness. Of course, the interior space and decoration is hip and beautiful. Book this place EARLY."

Service was first class and the food pretty good.\n\nMy husband and daughter had the California rolls. His was baked and came with salmon and a sauce.  He enjoyed it much more than she did; she felt there was too much rice and too little filling.\n\nMy other daughter and I had the pizzas.  Her Margheritta was fine, but generic.  It didn't taste as fresh as it should, better, fresher basil would have helped.  My smoked chicken pizza, however, was close to perfection.  The acidity of the goat cheese was balanced by the bitterness of the arugula and the pesto, while the chicken provided substance and the walnuts cruch.

            "review": "My favorite brunch in Vegas. This place is so, so, so good in so many different ways.\n\nFirst, a brief word about how the brunch works. It's a hybrid of buffet service and a la carte, which usually means either/or. In this case, it means AND. As a proud glutton, I'm a big fan of \"and.\" You can order whatever you like from the kitchen, and while they're making your dishes, you can graze from the many - god I hate this phrase - \"action stations\" where chefs whip up smoothies, sandwiches, sushi and more. The meal is $40 or so per person.\n\nThe best things to get from the buffet stations include ham and fontina on pretzel bread or the pecorino honeycomb panini. Especially the latter - the combination of sweet and savory here is amazing. From the sushi station, the crispy rice and tuna is craveworthy and delicious.\n\nBut don't fill up without getting an entree or two from the kitchen. Best of the bunch is the French toast, made of a melt-in-your-mouth brioche dredged in Frosted Flakes. Skip the syrup, this doesn't need it.\n\nThe Margherita pizza is decent - it's not VPN, of course, but it's quite tasty. The lobster benedict also and the banana Nutella crepes also got rave reviews from my companions.\n\nThe meal concludes with the infamous SImon junk food platter, which features Kerry Simon's versions of things like the Hostess cupcake, Rice Krispie Treats, chocolate chip cookies, brownies and even a pile of cotton candy. Save room.\n\nDrink service: they offer a $17 add-on option for bottomless Bellinis or Bloody Marys, the latter of which you can customize to your liking with dozens of veggies, hot sauces, condiments and add-ons all the way up to Slim Jims.\n\nThe atmosphere is great. The casual vibe is enhanced by the staff in pajamas, and sometimes the guests as well. Kerry Simon has been in the kitchen every time I've eaten here, and Palms founder George Maloof is regularly in the front of the house.\n\nBy far the best reason to get out of bed before noon on a Saturday. Or after - they serve until 4pm."

We had tickets to an event at the Palms and decided upon this restaurant as it offered a menu different than the typical contemporary dishes or steak house fare that we can get at home in Houston. The restaurant was situated next to the pool and featured open, contemporary decor. The upscale atmosphere was toned down by the casual converse-styled footware many of the waitstaff work with their black attire. All of the individuals working the house that evening were very accomodating - from the hostess, the somelier (which we didn't order any wine, but he did stop at our table during our meal to check how we were doing), the waiter, and even the guy who continued to fill our water and tea glasses. We started with some great cocktails (as a southern girl, I could not resist passing up the watermelon/strawberry/kiwi margarita concoction) which were followed by crispy shrimp appetizer. Between courses, Chef Simon came by our table to ensure everything was ok (we were not chatty this time). Our main dishes included meatloaf (sounds odd to order in a nice restaurant, but it was cooked excellently - worthy of ordering again!) with truffled potatoes, and lamb tagine, accompanied with spinach and macaroni & cheese. During our meal, we had inquired of the waiter regarding whether Chef Kerry normally worked in this restaurant and he responded that he split his time between the several restaurants in Las Vegas as well as a location in L.A.  Shortly thereafter, Chef Simon came to our table to chat about where we were from, what we thought about dinner, how we heard about his restaurant, etc. (I sound like a geek, but was so excited to meet him). We had the creme brulee trio for dessert and Chef Kerry sent out a complimentary bowl of cotton candy. Overall, an excellent and memorable dinner!  The only unfortunate thing was that I was so stuffed from all of the food my curiousity left me wondering what the homemade junk food platter ($25 tray with all kinds of homemade goodies - cotton candy, cookies, ding dongs, rice crispy treats, etc.) would have been like. I'll need to find a good excuse to visit again with a larger group just so that we can indulge ourselves!"

I love the wide open room flooded with sunshine from the floor to ceiling windows that line the far wall.  As you enjoy your nummy nums you can watch tourists and cool people frolic in the pool just beyond the window.  This is a great people watching spot, as we've seen more than a handful of celebs chilling here.  Make sure to bring your shades.  You might need them depending on where you are seated.  They have an AYCD bloody mary bar or mimosas/bellinis.  I love both, but here I def recommend the bloody mary bar as you can pick your vodka & they have every possible accoutrement you could ever need to spice it up.  On the other hand, their  mimosas & bellinis are a formula for a mid afternoon hangover, aka crappy quality champagne.  They have an area where you can grab your own foods stocked with sushi, smoked salmon, miso soup, fruit, cereal, pastries, etc.  Then they have a menu that is AYCE ordering.  I go nuts for the chicken & waffles (minus the waffles).\n\nHappy hour is M-F, 4-7 and everything on the menu, including drinks is $6.  The lounge is super comfy and you get to enjoy a little bit of sunshine as the sun sets.  Of late it seems all happy hours offer calamari to varying degrees of success.  Simon sets the standard for hh calamari, not too many unfavorable pieces, lightly fried, with a ponzu dipping sauce on the side."

The decor was very modern and whimsical, and I loved the candy bar by the hostess stand, plus it was great to see Chef Simon hanging out with the customers!  The service was great, and our waitress was very friendly!  I went with a group of friends and we tried everything on the menu, along with the sushi, smoothie, and sandwich bar.  Everything was beyond heavenly, and the french toast was my favorite!  Simon Sunday brunch is a must anytime I'm in Vegas from now on!"

I expected good things from the Palms and Simon wasn't great at all.  I dropped in late night to pre-game drinks with friends before heading out to Marquee nightclub.  The bar area is small...not much room to move around.  Upon entering the bar, the sleek modern style of the decor appealed to me.  I liked the fact that there is a gorgeous pool just outside the bar. This would be a great place to take a date during the summer and just lounge by the pool and drink all night long on a hot summer night.  I honestly wasn't impressed by the staff at all.  There were dirty drink glasses all over the bar and they were definitely understaffed.  The manager definitely looked like she was having a bad night...I mean if your in the hospitality industry and working for tips...wouldn't you have a smile on your face and be as friendly as possible?? So, nonetheless, we decided on just one round of drinks and headed out to Marquee!  Would I go back....not anytime soon...I would rather go to Ghost Bar, but after reading other people's review about the Sunday Brunch at Simon, I'm willing to give it a try!!!!  I want to be impressed!!! :)"

I wish I would have brought my bathing suit, b/c you can chill by the pool after and if you get the all you can drink Bloody Marys or the Mimosas, you can just stay there all day and enjoy the libations ...  definately worth checking out."

And that's a tough one for me to admit.\n\nWe bought one of those Travel Zoo coupon's (think Groupon) which provided us each with a 4 course meal and a beverage of our choice. We started off with the calamari and ohmagawd was it delicious. My entree was the Thai Curry Chicken which was just ok, but the hubby (whoa!) had the Short Ribs and let me tell you (from a non-meat lover) they were AMAZING! Especially coupled with the truffled Mac & Cheese and lovely dessert sampler to top it all off. All were simply to die for!\n\nThe ambiance was just lovely as well, seating us right next to the view of the beautiful (but closed) pool. They had a private dining room with the coolest wall of plants I'd ever seen. Looks like something you'd find in Snoop's place, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe service was simply lovely as well. Everyone was incredibly friendly and attentive. Couldn't ask for more!\n\nWhen I come back to Vegas, I'm having dinner here again. No doubt the best meal we had our whole trip."

The rigatoni bolognese was just bad. No flavor what so ever with the sauce watered down. I've tasted better sauce from a can! The only thing that kept me from going hungry was the calamari appetizer which was right on spot. At 28 bucks for a pasta dish, you better be on your game; especially in a city where culinary creations have set high exceptions. You best keep up Simon.\n \nI was the only one dining in the entire restaurant so service was on spot for the most part (given) . Water glass was always filled. Only complaint was that when the waitress came to remove my barely touched pasta dish, she asked if I wanted it boxed. I said no thank you. No inquire from her part as to whether there was a problem with the food. THAT is customer service.\n\nSpend your money else where - slot machines."

I do strongly recommend it as they offer a special menu and I was surprised by the reasonable prices. The ambience here is very nice and my friend commented on it. We were going to sit at the bar but decided to get a table. We but ordered various sushi rolls. He also had a salad. Everything tasted good, well presented and served promptly.

For the main course, the Banana Lead Halibut with salsa hits the spot, or the good 'ol meatloaf with mashed potato would make even Mom jealous! \n\nOf course no meal is complete without an adult libation and their full service bar is fully stocked to create anything you desire....I prefer the Rum & Ginger Tea or the Lemongrass Drop. \n\nMake sure you save room for dessert including Kerry's \"Big Bowl of Cotton Candy.\" A fun dish to share with others. But if you are on the adventurous side, try their \"Junk Food Platter\" that will bring back some great childhood memories. \n\nYou might even get Kerry himself to stop by your table to check on you as he does very often."

The servers all wear pajamas, which is cute and it's located on the 6th floor, where we got to eat near a glass wall overlooking the pool.  \n\nEach person pays $39.50 for adults or $13.00 for children.  This is a fixed price not including specialty drinks.  The menu has one side of items that are located at the buffet and another side that has items freshly prepared by the chefs.  All in all, not impressed with the food.  The french toast was very doughy and everything else didn't have very good flavor to it.\n\nThe highlight was the dessert tray that comes standard with each meal.  It had a giant cloud of pink cotton candy, baked goods and other sweet items.  Totally recommend that and if they had a standalone price to only get that, I would definitely go back.  \n\nIt's a great concept, just needs a little better execution."

This time around I set up a business dinner with Simon Restaurant about 2 months ago with Julie for our Cloud b business dinner on Sunday, September 7, 2014. The room they placed us in was beautiful and overlooked the pool. The ambiance was great. The waiter and staff was very friendly and on top of everything making sure our glasses were never empty. The food was amazing from the wok chard edamame to the calamari with ponzu sauce to the pasta to the curry chicken to dessert which included cookies, brownies, and cotton candy. Except for the Meatloaf. It was a bit dry, lacked taste and the bbq sauce on top was too much. The mashed potatoes melted in your mouth but I think the show stopper was the dessert! I think everyone's eyes were bigger than our tummies. Of course the kids enjoyed it! I'm giving the Simon, on this review, only a 4 star. The chefs forgot to send us the fries which were on our menu. I spoke to the waiter and he spoke with the manager and they said it would be taken off the bill.  Julie went out of her way to add our logo to the menu. Everyone enjoyed the family style dinner. Overall, great experience and would recommend for a wedding dinner or business dinner again."

I was excited to go there as I had not been there before and had usually wondered what it was like as we go to the palms a lot and drive by the signage.\n \nI started with an order of calamari that came with a ponzu based sauce that also came with shishito peppers $9.  The calamari was a little on the chewy side but had a nice flavor on its own, the sauce however was a bit thick and very over powering to the palate. The peppers were nice though.\n\nMy boss had a Caesar salad $12, which he thought was very nice.\nMy boss ordered the Ribeye \"filet\" with tempura shishito peppers, ponzu sauce $42 I ordered the dry aged New York Strip with fingerling potato coins (like 5 little slices) $39. Sides here are ordered separately and since we already had appetizer and salad, we opted for just the steaks.\n\nBoth steaks I feel had the same problem, the very thick Ribeye \"filet\" and the New York were pretty cooked on one side less on the other and over seasoned to the point my taste buds were getting that salty burning feeling. Not to mention I would cut off most of the over seared side. They came with a b\u00e9arnaise sauce and demi-glace sauce, which were both very nice.\n\nThe server was initially there to take orders fast etc., the water server was always Johnny on the spot, but then the server was ghost. I noted that when the assistants would bring out food they would mess up a lot on the seating and who gets what as it happened to us (I know this from working in restaurants myself). In the end, we had to wait about 15 minutes to ask for our bill and wait for him to bring the actual bill.\n\nThe place was beautiful but the atmosphere was very loud. I think this \nis due to the architecture.\n\nI have to give big negatives on the service and more on the food.\n \nI must say I do not think I will ever go there again. I expected more as should be expected and I had hoped for more from such a well-known Chef's place."

This review is for the Travelzoo menu ($99 for two) which still seems a bit overpriced but it did include passes to their clubs, Moon and Ghostbar.\n\nThe ambience is on the casual side as it overlooks the pool area.  There is a sushi bar and a regular bar inside.  We started the evening with a peach bellini (that tasted nothing of peach) and a watery sangria.  Bleh.  1 star for the drinks.\n\nOur amuse bouche was a crispy sushi rice.  It was not crispy, but rather chewy. The rice was too heavy; it was not well executed. 2 stars. I'm starting to see why this place is not crowded.\n\nAppetizers of spicy tuna roll and Caesar salad were ok...nothing special, dressing was a bit heavy on the salt. 2 stars.\n\nHubby's Chicken Curry was decent, a little spicy and fruity with the pineapple chutney. I had the pan-roasted sea bass. While the fish itself was cooked nicely, it was presented skin on top which was not crispy at all. It was a poor attempt at pan roasting as the skin was soft and chewy.  It would have been better if they left it off. 2.5 stars.\n\nMac n cheese gratin was a good sized portion to share but unfortunately, neither of us wanted to eat it. I like my mac n cheese to be creamy and cheesy and this one was disappointingly floury tasting. 2 stars.\n\nDessert!  Everyone raves about the Junk Food Platter.  It's a great idea but the food was just ok.  I'd say it looks better than it tasted...basically sugar, sugar and more sugar!  The butterscotch thing tasted like sugar, the cookie looked good but tasted like a Chips Ahoy cookie, caramel corn was ok and the Rice Krispy treat could have come out of a foil pouch from Kellogg's.  I did not get around to the snoball or the brownie as everything was so sickenly sweet. 2 stars.\n\nThe service was definitely slow.  When my sushi appetizer was brought out, there was no soy and no chopsticks to go with it.  Sure there was wasabi and ginger on my plate but this is not finger food...it took a few minutes just to get the items that should have been brought earlier or at the same time.  Also, I ordered another drink after appetizers and it did not show up until I was nearly done with my dinner. However, the waiter was very nice overall, apologized and did not charge me for forgetting about it, so 3 stars for him.\n\nI have to say that everything was presented nicely, so if you care what it looks like more than how it tastes, you will love it.  For me, I would prefer delicious food over artful presentation. With so many great Las Vegas restaurants to choose from, I would skip this place."

My burger was divine though the bread a bit overly toasted. My sister's sandwich was served on the hardest toasted baguette known to man she could barely cut it with a knife and ended up just eating the meat and cheese out of it.

It wasn't worth the $99. \n\nWe started off OK with a tasty amuse bouche, good salad and decent sushi, but our main courses were not very good at all. The sea bass was kind if pathetic with bland, overcooked side items. The fish was under seasoned and skinny with the skin still on top. We were expecting much better. We also had the flatbread which was very average. It was obvious they were trying to get by as cheap as possible with the drinks they included. \n\nThe biggest joke was the junk food platter for dessert ($25 value, yeah right). A bunch of stale, tasteless crap. If you're going to serve something like that, everything needs to be freshly baked and tasty, and none of it was. You could break your teeth on the dry, hard, stale brownies. The cotton candy was actually the best thing on the plate, and I don't like cotton candy.\n\nPerhaps ordering off the regular menu would have been better, but who knows. Beware of the travelzoo voucher. What seems like a good value may not be if they are only including cheap, limited choices. I felt like the service was a little lacking as well, but this may also be due to the fact that we used the travelzoo voucher and were given a \"special\" menu."

But when you do finally get to the place you'll be pleasantly surprised.. for this is one of the best 'casual dining' restaurants on the Strip. Before a concert at The Pearl, we did all apps.. all very good... ahi tuna tartar.. crab-cake (exceptional).. sashimi.. pear-endive, blue cheese salad.. and there's more very interesting items to choose from.  Service was top notch (Stacey).. and the total bill was half what you'll pay in many other places. Do happy hour from 3 to 6 and the savings improve. One note to management.. put a Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc on the wine list and the whole experience goes from 4.5 to 5 stars."

The brunch is divided into two parts--a regular bar area where you can take an assortment of rolls and other sweets, treats like fruit flavored crispy treats and large peel and eat shrimp from a large tub.  In addition, you can have a panini or crepe made and there are other goodies there, too.  The other choice is to order items off the menu that is part of Sunday brunch.\n\nI first got some treats off the regular buffet like spread, basically junk food--well let's say, food with lots of sweetness.  The winner here was the cake pop.  That was quite good.\n\nI had several items from the order menu.  The lobster havarti Benedict was great and the Simon French toast made from dipping the brioche into frosted flakes was quite good, too.\n\nThe winner today though was a small baguette sandwich made with fig jam and bleu cheese.  With the baguette put on the panini maker, the cheese melted and the fig and cheese together was the best thing I had.\n\nService was OK.  I had two different servers.  Coffee was not refilled until I asked and at one point I had three dirty dishes on the side of my two top high table.\n\nI'm glad I took the opportunity to go here before  Simon closes."

Open, airy and sunny, with a view of the pool. Like going on a mini vacation over the lunch hour. Parking is easy and close. It's quiet and not crowded for weekday lunch. Simon USED TO BE fast service with some of the best Sushi in town. Which is why my last experience is such a fall from grace. First tip off was a new, and much more limited, menu. Service was painfully slow, even though we were one out of maybe 6-8 tables. Took forever to even take our order. Got a Margherita pizza for an appetizer, and it was hot and delicious. That was the only thing in our meal that was. At our table of 4, the Rainbow roll was not very fresh tasting or smelling, the famous crispy rice tuna squares had none of their usual flavor, the turkey Reuben was dry and inedible, and the sliders were cold. Nobody at our table had a good meal and two of us left hungry after not being able to choke down the cold and dried out sandwiches. Our waiter offered to redo our meals, but we had already been gone from the office over an hour, so no time to remake our food. People have said Chef Kerry is in poor health, and we can't help but wonder if he's no longer in the kitchen, or if there was some other change in culinary staff. Perhaps it is The Palms' recent ownership change. Whatever is going on, we left heartbroken that our favorite lunch spot's time seems to have come to an end. I do hope someone steps in FAST and can bring things back to their formerly consistent level of quality and customer delight."

I'm patient, and I'm willing to look past the minor details most people would complain about. But even with that kind of leniency, all for the sake of food, Simon was still a disappointment.\n\nFirst, our waitress filled our water glasses with Fiji water without giving us any other options, had the busboy top us off after every sip (which would normally be a good thing), only to later tell us after we asked that it was $9 a bottle (which makes it a bad thing). Second, the entrees were okay. I think our prepartying and the expensive water tricked us into thinking the food was better than it really was. The curries weren't anything spectacular, the meatloaf was meatloaf, and the pasta was okay. Third, when we asked for boxes, our waitress paused for a few seconds while looking at our food and said, \"...sssuuurrreee...\"\n\nEven with a less-than-sensational review like this, there were a few plusses: 1, the edamame was the best I've ever had - lightly grilled and seasoned with sea salt and other spices, 2, the calamari turned a standard appetizer into something tastier - the lime, salt and spices made the perfectly fried calamari delicious, and 3, the tiger roll was pretty damn good. But good appetizers don't make a worthy restaurant experience. The ambiance is warm, the design is modern, the view of the outdoor pool is gorgeous and the trip there is a trip in itself.

(Yes you can switch it up) If you have company in town, or want to impress, this meal is totally worth it!\nYou can come in your pajamas, all the staff will be wearing theirs! Unless you come on Easter, then you have pajamas, bunny tails, and even a good ol rabbit as your server.\nSo this is how the AYCE works. There is a small buffet with treats, dessert, shrimp, bagels, pastries, fresh smoothies, and juices. \nIf you want hot food, it is still AYCE, but ordered through your waiter. Options include, French toast, 3 styles of eggs benedicts, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried chicken, and more. I was very impressed with all of the hot options. The only food that did not stand out was the prime rib. They were only offering it for Easter, (as well as ham) but it was so fatty. Not at all a great cut! \nThe bar area worked like this, if you have a wrist band, help yourself. The staff was all super friendly and helpful. I was even brought an extra drink that I did not order when the service got slow. Another perk, they use good vodka. Unlimited Belvedere for $20 makes the expensive breakfast worth it!!\n\nOverall, it is not somewhere I will go every weekend, but I hope this place stays in Vegas because it's a perfect Vegas hangover brunch. Oh and did I mention it has a pool view. So yes, you can stare at hot men and women half naked while you dine. You are welcome."

For $7, it's a deal....I could only put down 3 cuz my belly was gonna pop from all the foood.\n\nHere's the low down on the food:\n\nChicken n waaaffles- chik was ok, but the waffles....yummmm, light, crispy, tasty w/ whipped butter slathered all over n maple syrup\n\nBiskits n gravy- ooooooh, arteries were cloggin while eatin, gravy was soooooo good n tasty, I ate half a biskit n all the gravy like it was crack cocaine....I was gonna lick the plate, but didn't go there....\n\nBBQ ribs- not badd, not great either, coleslaw was yawwwwwwn.... my ribs are better and my coleslaw too.....veered off track here with ribs\n\nIf you see a pattern here it's cuz the above items are from the \"white trash\" section o the menu....\n\nPeel n eat shrimp- these were BIG, no skimping here, marinated in onions, celery, seasonins with a cocktail/remulade sauce w/ a kick, I'd have to say one o the better chilled shrimp/prawn i've had, ate 2 platters o these..... couldn't stop\n\nSushi-  the crispy sesame thingys that everybody talks about were a let down, too hard/crispy....maybe a bad batch but I didn't have room in my belly to retry... hamachi was the best, spicy tuna was good, sake ok.  but i didn't come for the sushi\n\nEggs benedict-  not my favorite, but it was good....the hash browns on the side...WOW! the BEST hb i ever tasted?  It was sooo tasty n crunchy n tasty... i waant some now...\n\nSmoked salmon w/ capers n cream cheese n bagel-  well.... Smoked salmon w/ capers n cream cheese n bagel\n\nPigs in a blanket- lil dawgs wrapped in flaky pastry, like a dozen o them dawggies w/ ketchup n spicy mustard, could not finish....gettin stuffed\n\nFruit smoothies-  oh soo good with i can't remember how many berries, i had 2 myself, but they say \"you are what u eat\" so i try not to consume too much \"fruity\" or 'nutty\" items\n\nSimon French toast-  the \"STAR\" of the menu.... I'm not a sweets guy but this could convert me... Frosted Flakes crusted brioche? Yes, it was delicioso... soft n crunchy, sweet n tasty, it was the ying n yang of the breakfast world....\n\nand there is still more on the menu, just could not eat anymore.... breakfast pizzas, panninis', custom omelets, yaddayadddaaaaa....\n\nFor $38, it's a great experience.... nice setting overlooking the pool, fireplace (must be nice in the summer) brunch poolside would be kool, staff is attentive in PJ's, lots of patrons in PJ's too, some in lingerie, i didn't see that on the menu....he he he\n\nSo give it a try.....have not had dinner yet but the Brunch is definitely a winner.... so if Brunch is between Breakfast and Lunch, what is between Lunch and Dinner?  Is it Linner?  Lunner?  Luncher?\n\ntil next time, good Brunching....."

The elevator to the sixth floor is just inside the entrance, and there is valet parking.  My wife and I wanted to try it before it closes it doors (in a couple months), and we found a restaurant that hasn't quite decided what it wants to be when it grows up.  Part poolside cafe, part sports bar, and part gourmet restaurant.  This ambiguity also shows up in the prices, which are not quite what you would pay for Michelin cuisine, but well above what you might have expected when you first walk into the place.  Dinner cost us about $160 (tax and tip included), pumped up by a bill of almost $60 for two rounds of drinks (no wine).\n\nWe both decided to order the double burger, since the burger is Kerry Simon's signature dish which he used to win his appearance on Iron Chef.  It was a great burger - much too big for most people to finish.  We each took half a burger home in a doggy bag.  The meat was high quality, and well-prepared on a brioche bun.  The \"Tuscan\" fries were nothing special.  We also split an iceberg wedge salad and a crab cake appetizer.  The salad was very good, with blue cheese and bacon.  The crab cake was nothing special.\n\nThe problems were in the details.  The service was, shall we say, conspicuously inconspicuous.  We waited half an hour after our salad was cleared before the burgers arrived.  Our water was served without ice, and never refilled.  The waiter did not come by to offer fresh ground pepper on our salad.  The bread and butter came late, and there was no butter knife for the butter.  Perhaps these small details just reflect the kinds of things that fall apart when a restaurant is preparing to close its doors, but they were mildly annoying.\n\nAll things considered, one could do better for the price."

But the entrees were an absolute disaster, as well as the appetizers. \n\nThe calamari was spongy and served inexplicably with a soy dipping sauce that did nothing for the calamari. The pizza on flatbread could have been good but was completely overloaded with competing flavors. \n\nThe meatloaf was very tasty, but there was nothing special about it other than it was exactly what you'd expect from meatloaf. \n\nAll in all, it was the most expensive meal I had in Las Vegas, by at least 50%, and easily the absolute worst."

We called earlier in the day to see if our reservation could be changed to an hour later and they told us they could but there would be an extra 45min wait on top of that. We scrambled and made it to our original time. \nThroughout the night we found it odd that there were many empty tables in the restaurant yet they couldn't move us to a later reservation w/out an extra 45mins wait...\nThe service started out great, we ordered a few drinks before we put in our food order. They were served in a fair amount of time, we were not in a hurry or it could have been considered slow bar service. \nThe server was very friendly, which was the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1.\nWe had a 4 course meal which they managed to screw up. They forgot to bring us one of our appetizers. Ok, mistakes happen, we let it go. \nMain course came out and it tasted good, fresh. But we waited an eternity for desert. From when we finished our main platter it took about 20 mins for desert to be brought out. There was a table next to us that had the same problem, they waited even a bit longer from what we noticed.\nWith so many places in Vegas that are top notch, go elsewhere so you will not be disappointed."

For the price of admission you get to eat from 10 to 4, we showed up at 11 so we made a full day out of it.  For 16 bucks you get all you can drink Chandon champaign, mimosas, or billinis.  Needless to say my wife got hammered.  \n\nThe Bad : The food wasn't too good, here is the deal, there is a small buffet that serves up some interesting paninis (good), there is a smoothie bar (ehh), sushi (sucked), a few pastries (real small selection but good), and candy (it's candy).  Everything else you order off the menu.  They have pizza (margarita was real good) different benedicts that were ok, and what they call white trash stuff, it was like pigs and blankets and chicken and waffles.  Basically everything came out just ok, soggy waffle and chicken.  The eggs with the benedicts did come out cooked right.  Everyone gets all excited about the lobster benedict but you can't bribe me with a few tiny lumps of over cooked lobster.  Just everything tasted precooked and like it was being kept warm in the back, it probably was.  Oh ya, the biscuits and gravy sucked as well as our service for the most part.  They have simons signature dessert the junk food platter which is cotton candy (awesome) and home made snow balls and hostess cupcakes (the real deal is better for sure) and a crusty brownie and a chocolate chip cookie.  It's a cool idea but doesn't taste that good. \n\nThe Ugly :  Brunch for 2 with one champaign with tip was 115 F&%@ dollars.  We could have went to breakfast and ordered everything we ate off a menu and it would have been less and it would been fresh and would have tasted better.  If it was cheaper we would probably come back because the selection is fun and so is the pool but it was just too pricey, for 115 bucks I want to eat something amazing.  \n\nWe ate at simon at the hard rock a few years ago and It wasn't too good and this place didn't change our minds about this chef, sorry."

We made reservations for 6pm on a Monday night. \n\nI love that Simon over looks the pool and huge fireplace that they have outside. They have a very modern and sleek design to the whole restaurant. In the bar area the chandeliers are made out of clearish stones. Very cool. They also have a huge wine cellar. It's made of clear glass so you can see all those precious, beautiful and tasty bottles of wine. \n\nBefore we had gone to the restaurant I'd naturally checked Yelp and discovered they had a great happy hour menu. So we decided to save some cash and hit up happy hour. So when we got there at 6 we were told we'd have to sit at the bar to order off the happy hour menu. Which was totally cool with us. Plus, there was an open bench with a table ready for us. \nThe happy hour menu is great there is nothing over $15 and its a really amazing sampling of their main menu. Joel ordered the Hamburger with Swiss cheese. I ordered the Salmon Sashimi and we split the Fried Calamari. The Sashimi melted in my mouth. The Fried Calamari came with a wonderful citrus soy sauce. It really made the Calamari pop! Even Joel's Hamburger was tasty. It came with lots of fries too. \n\nThe service was great even though the bar was busy. Our food came out quickly and our server kept checking to make sure we had everything we needed. \n\nI'm so happy we got to dine in Simon's before they close. It will be missed greatly. I can tell by the food we ate that the rest of the menu must be awesome as well. I truly walked out of there with my tummy happy."

The one shining aspect of the meal was the AMAZING breadbowl, however, featuring homemade cheeze-its, buttermilk biscuits, handmade pretzels, and zucchini bread.\n\nFor my meal I had the Cali Pizza (Toro, Crab, Avocado, Daikon, Endive, Soy) and 4-cheese saffron truffle mac n' cheese.  Simon states this is the best Mac n' Cheese in the world but I've had better at Michael Mina's Bourbon Steak, Emeril's Fishhouse, and M at Miranova.\n\nFor dessert?  The junkfood platter with gourmet versions of a hostess cupcake, snowball, ricecrispy treats, and a chocolate shake.  Cute, but essentially just sugary.\n\nMy friend loved his steak and chocolate cake.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, however, was the hostess in the leather apron.....yowzaz."

I was there attending a conference and was delighted with the family style appetizers and salad that was served at each table. The spinach flat bread pizza, bread basket which included banana bread was awesome. The remaining appetizers included port pot stickers and calamari calamari which were nothing to scream about. However the bamboo salad (i think they called it) was delicious. It was served family style with walnuts, goat cheese and apples throughout the bowl. I in fact had two servings. The dinner unfortunately I was not too impressed with. I ordered the grilled halibut with steamed veggies. I do have to say that the presentation was nice, they were served in bamboo dishes that were covered when brought to the table and the server removed their tops once they were served to you. The halibut was too dry for my taste and my friends who actually asked for a side of dipping sauce to eat with it and the veggies for being steamed were also really dry and plain. \nThe desert which is what I read had the best reviews was not that great for me. The cotton candy is HUGE I'll give them that but honestly who can finish a bowl of cotton candy as big as they serve it. The remaining desert were just ordinary rice crispy treats, hostess cupcakes, coconut bon bon and cookies. Overall sadly I wasn't too impressed but at least it was a new restaurant I can say I tried :)"

Bonus are the views of the pool, which depending on the time of day is entertainment in itself (lunch and a show)!!!!\n\nMy first experience was for breakfast as they opened at 8am, which meant very few others were in the restaurant (but we were still on East Coast time). I ordered three egg whites with chicken sausage and hash browns. Everything was exceptional: the eggs were fluffy, sausage (and bacon - I stole some of my husband's) was fab, and hash browns actually tasted like potatoes and were not weighed down by cooking oil which is the usual MO. Great coffee and cool music, accompanied by floor-to ceiling glass windows, couldn't ask for better. I must admit that the coffee was heavy-handed in terms of price: at 6$ a carafe, two carafes were as much as one entree. Come on, guys, it's just freakin' joe!!!\n\nSushi at Simon later that day was amazing. They have a limited menu in the early afternoon, but the sushi choices are extensive. A starter of zucchini and pretzel bread served with butter was a little odd, but both were yummy. The spicy tuna, yellowfin and salmon skin rolls were all fresh and delicious. \n\nA bonus of dining at Simon after 9am, esp. during lunch and after, is the view of the pool crowd. If you're into people-watching, this is a total destination. There was a melange of g-string clad beauties, middle-aged dudes in straw cowboy hats wearing banana hammocks, muscle guys, and vegas partiers of both genders having fun to pounding club music courtesy of their own DJ."

I can not believe they charge $50 dollars a person( I went on fathers day, so I don't know if they raised it specifically for that day). We sat and waited for the waitress to come to the table to explain how everything worked for about 15 minutes. I thought this place was a buffet style. Its not. It's half buffet, and half you order from the menu with the waitress. The buffet section only had fruit, bagels, cereal and crapes. Something like they give you for free at like a holiday inn for the continental breakfast. The items you order from the waitress take 30-40 minutes to come out. We ordered the eggs Benedict, and frosted flake french toast. After that came, we ordered a mini pizza. Waited another 30 minutes. I was still hungry but didn't feel like waiting if I ordered something else. So for 50 bucks I got a glass of orange juice, a chocolate muffin, a slice of french toast, and one crape.  Awesome....I will not be going back here."

I would say the food is at a 4 now and that is because they dropped the popular desserts off the menu and only have the cotton candy.  Gone is the junk food dessert platter.  They still have items on the buffet portion but none really stood out to me.\n\nThe ribs and the apple cinnamon pancakes off the menu were amazing just like last year. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the horrid service we received.  So bad that we asked to speak to a manager when the bill came.  I understand we were a large party and so gratuity was already added which I guess to our main waiter, Kenny, meant that he didn't have to earn it.  Orders were slow, drinks were slow, utensils were slow.  Someone in our party waited 20 minutes for a fork.  Toward the end one of the birthday host found the alcohol and took over serving duties.  It was deja vu from last year.  \n\nManagers excuse was they were short staffed.  I don't want to hear excuses.  Kenny should have mentioned that when we first seated.  He could have left pitchers of water, tea, extra utensils on the table to alleviate his burden.  Last year the server left the champagne bucket and we served ourselves.  \n\nFINAL WARNING:  PAY WITH CASH or Simons will hijack your bank account.  It has now been four days and they still have a hold on my account for a bottomless brunch I didn't order for $77.  It's not necessarily the amount but the principle.  I was also charged $51 for the alcohol free brunch which is what was my bill should have been.   I called and talked to the manager and he said it happens pretty frequently.  I understand holds but charging me for an entire meal I didn't order is out of line.  Again, just excuses."

Not so at his new outlet at the Palms.  My #1 problem is that the menu really hasn't changed...ever.  So what maybe used to be innovative Asian fusion is now SO tired and bored and there are so many people who do it better.  The one special that looked intriguing: a white truffle polenta (reasonably priced at $20) was sold out--(and really, it's a shame to sell out of white truffles because it makes you look like you're either a cheapskate and didn't want to lay out the money for them, or you don't have the clout to get enough!)  Now to the service: the hostess was warm and friendly and one waiter seemed great, unfortunately I didn't have him but at least he noticed I had no utensils when my main course came, and addressed it (my waiter was nowhere to be found.).  I understand the benefits of casual, understated service, but this is too casual to the point where they don't really seem to care about the food, or you (with the sold exception of the captain who came by several times and each time called me something like 'chief' or 'champ'--now why would anyone thing that would be proper or appreciated?  I'd never go back again."

Upon entering it was very bright and naturally lit by the adjacent pool area.  The noise level could be abit too much for some who may want a more romantic setting.  The staff and hosts are very well mannered and friendly.  Customer service is top-notch and what is expected in Vegas.  \nMy date and I attempted to try as much variety as possible and this was possible because the portions are small which is perfect for this.  The presentation is excellent with each dish that is made to order like the french toast or the 5 varieties of eggs benedict. I could only down 3 of five and all were delish.  I prefer the made to order side of the menu vs. the buffet part which you serve yourself.  They had sushi in the buffet part which they make as they are being picked up.  Wasn't upto my standards.  Especially mixing it with the earlier mentioned items.  Pastries are all good and fresh\n\nOverall, I'd go back again and try to have more than 2 of their awesome DIY bloody marys.  Just plan to drop $50 per person and pace yourself to savor it all."

I wish I could bring it up to a 3, but the service and food wasn't very good for what we expected.\n\nWe had reservations, made a week in advance--but it didn't seem necessary. We finally were taken to a table near the fireplace, and behind us, a larger table of about ten were seated around the same time. This table becomes a problem when my chair is hit and banged repeatedly by the person directly behind me. We finally stood and moved our own table.  One of the waiters said he saw this happening when we told him we moved our table! Is this really a world class chef owning this restaurant that wouldn't see the situation and handle it? We watch too many Food Network shows. Our exceptions are just too high!  The service was horrible from the time we sat down, until we left. We had three waiters come to our table, making it confusing as to who was our waiter. We told the one who took our dinner order that we had a show to make, but this made no difference to his attending to us. We were very specific about how we wanted our hamburgers cooked. \"Medium,\" and he assured us this would not be over or under cooked. If you look a my picture (if I can get it up), you'll see a charred and \"dry\" hamburger, which took WAY too long to arrive. We must have waited an hour to get our dinner. They were NOT busy at all, but the wait staff was so annoying, running up and down, back and forth like a bunch of lunatics, just so disruptive! The experience was just terrible.  I've no idea who they were helping in such a froth, because it wasn't us! Our waiter, had his butt glued to one particular table as if it was the Queen of England's! Meanwhile, he totally ignored us. When our burgers finally came, we both said we'd rather have an In and Out Burger! TALK about \"not sustainable food.\" It was a \"double\" and way too big for anyone to finish! What a waste of a cow's life! Our waiter should have advised us to share this! But beyond the size, it was charred, dry and just awful. But we were on a time frame and were forced to accept it...but, our waiter NEVER came back to even ask how it was! He as too damn busy with some cotton candy show at the table he was marrying. Really? Then, another waiter came over to tell us that another guest was a guitar player in the Ringo show that night (by the way, he was Bruce Springsteen's guitar player and only played on one song), but the waiter had no right to infringe on that man's privacy and tell us who he was. It did explain why people kept coming over and annoying him, and us, since they were crowding out our table! This wait staff needs to stop all this running around, and noise! OMG, the chattering and cackling! AND pay attention to the diners. Obviously they didn't know I Yelp!  It was so over priced and just one of the worse experiences we've ever had in Vegas (or anywhere,) but then again, we dine in Laguna Beach, and outstanding restaurants like Nick's. AND that takes us to later on that night. I have never been so sick! Doubled over, coming from both ends!! I kid you not! I have a half of mind to contact them and demand a refund! Save your money and go to the damn taco place in the Casino. WAY better service and delicious!! Ugh, what a nightmare! Thank God tonight we're going to Ramsey's place.

I was depressed at the lack of anything resembling nutrition that we'd had so far, so we thought we'd have a nice meal.\n\nIt was an excellent meal, we had great conversation and the cherry on the top was the dessert, absolutely incredible. We left glowing and happy.\n\nThe result was us returning for at least 2 meals a day for the remainder of our trip. We found a good thing, so why not experience most of the menu (and try the brunch if you're there on a Sunday).\n\nI love and found many of the dishes interesting and very creative. There was an inventiveness to the flavors that shone through in everything we ate, from meatloaf to braised ribs, and their Sunday brunch.\n\nFast forward 2 years to last week. I was in town for a bachelor party. We wanted to have one nice meal, so I floated taking a cab over to palms place, reciting my prior experiences. The result was, again, an awesome experience. Our group filled up on Sushi, appetizers and barely had room for mains.\n\nThe only thing I could possibly be critical of was that sometimes our drinks took a bit too long to arrive. Frankly that hurt them more than us, as we would have just ordered more drinks...\n\nI also have to give a shout out to their bussing staff. Absolutely awesome. Water always filled, table always clean - I've not experienced better.\n\n---\nWhat it comes down to is that Simon has done something that very few restaurants get right. I loved the restaurant the first time and returned over 2 years later - and it lived up to memory. That just never happens.\n\nSo my hats off to management and staff. Please keep up the good work."

I wouldn't go any other time than during the Sunday brunch because during this time you can try everything. My favorite thing was the Philly Eggs Benedict--amazing. The paninis and sushi were good as well. You get cotton candy at the end of your meal and you can even take home candy from the tiered shelf near the entrance. These innovative ideas make Simon really stand out.\n\nThe atmosphere was amazing, the service was great, and there's a nice view of the pool.\nThis is the one of the best food joints to go to off the strip."

The setting is ideal, by the pool at palms place, bright with tons of windows.  We felt like we were in a little oasis away from the strip.\n\nYou could tell a lot of original thought went into the sunday brunch as there were a bunch of things I'd never really encountered before at a buffet (candy bar, breakfast pizza, pyjama attire, junk food dessert, white trash menu, fresh smoothie bar etc, etc).  Refreshing these days where every bar tends to copy each other by calling itself some derivation of \"social house\" (same decor, same food, same overpriced food, same, same...give me something unique!)\n\nAnyways I'm getting off topic, but all I really need to say is that the simon Sunday brunch is really worth checking out, it's one of the best food establishments I've been to in Vegas.  Perfect setting, delicious food, and a unique concept.  A bit pricy at $38 per person, but I think worth it.  If you want to take advantage of the deluxe bloody Mary bar or the champagne bar it's extra $.\n\nA couple of my favourites from the meal:\n - simon roll from the sushi bar\n - junk food platter, make sure to use the take-out container from the carmel corn to stock up at the candy bar on the way out.\n - freshly made smoothies, i tried a couple and i liked the berry one the best (the chocolate protein one the least)"

The side facing the pool is all glass walls, which offer a nice poolside view. We were there for dinner, so the pool was already empty and the dining area dimly lit. The restaurant did seem pretty slow. Not sure if that's just because it's a weekday evening.\nPrices seemed slightly less than one would pay at any strip fine dining spot. So still pricey but not exorbitant. Since I was there with the family, I was able to sample quite a few items. I had the bolognaise. I had samples of the meatloaf, seared big eye tuna on quinoa, lobster mac n cheese. The bolognaise tasted good, although I was surprised it was served with cavatelli instead of something like tagliatelle. Just a different expectation I suppose. The meatloaf seemed a little bland. Seared tuna tasted decent but it was seared a bit too long I think, the cooked outer layer was a pretty big chunk of the slice. Lobster mac n cheese seemed a bit too truffle-y and rich to a few of us, but a few liked it. We had a slew of desserts. The fruit sorbet trio were clean and crisp tasting. A bit disappointed that there was no passion fruit sorbet upon receiving it after I ordered it because that was one flavor I really wanted to try. I did like the mango that came instead. The raspberry was nice, the lemon seemed a bit overly sour & tart.\nThe service was very good. Checked upon often, waters refilled quickly. I give this place a solid 3.5 stars. Couldn't quite give it the nudge to 4. I heard about their brunch and happy hour specials. Those might be worth trying another time. Otherwise I'm not sure I would come again. Decent place with good service but theres probably alot of other places I'd go first. If you're staying at Palms Place and/or enjoying the pool there, it would definitely be an ok spot to nosh."

Sorry Simon. \n\nI was staying at the palms place for work which I stay there every week, and decided to go to here and sit at the sushi bar because I was by myself.  The place was pretty dead because it was Wed night and so I was the only one at the sushi bar the entire hour I was there.  \n\nThe sushi chef kind of made the whole experience pretty crappy.  He was kind of rude from the beginning and I really don't think he knew what the word nice was.  I asked him what was good at the sushi bar tonight and he told me \"fish\".  No shit Sherlock.  Maybe I should not have asked that but then he just walked away.  So I ordered the spicy yellow tail roll and it came out looking terrible.  the rice was falling off the roll and it was not a good presentation.  When the roll is $13  I was expecting it to look a little nicer.  Especially when he was not too busy.  Strike two.  Then I asked for an order of their special Spicy tuna crispy rice thing.  He first told me straight out \"NO\" because it was too big for one person. I was pretty shocked.  Then I said I could eat it and if I was paying for it who cares.  So he unhappily made me the dish.  The crispy rice was dark brown and super burnt.  It was so hard to eat I finally stopped eating the rice and just ate the tuna.  I wanted to leave so bad.  So he came up to me as I was finishing the fish off the rice and said \"I told you it was too big for you to eat\".   I said no it would have been fine if the rice wasn't burnt.  He said \"That is crispy rice, if you didn't want crispy rice you should not have ordered it\"  The fish was not even very fresh which made it worse. \n\nNow for the one good part of the story.  They took my dish with the super burnt rice and a minute or two later the sushi chef came back up to me and I was ready to fight back this time and he said \" you were right your rice is really burnt, the roll is on the house\".  I was happy about that but I will not be back most likely.  i also had a nice server who gave me my beer.  \n\nNot a great first impression for someone who is going to be a weekly visitor. Oh well."

Mediocre food along with mediocre service made for a poor dining experience at a place know for brunch. It's a combination of buffet style, where you get your own food at a buffet line, and butler style, where you place an order with your server and they bring the order to you.\n\nThe Easter brunch I went to consisted of average paninis, sushi that was the equivalent of that found at the local grocery store, bruschetta, crepes, pastries and cereal.\n\nOf the higher-end items served butler style, the french toast with its crispy exterior was the best. Less than stellar items included the lobster havarti benedict that was sorely lacking any lobster. I saw a couple specs of crustacean between the bread base of the benedict. Continuing the disappointment were the dry ribs and even dryer jalapeno cornbread. The kid's pancake was dense and had an almost rubbery texture. Ham and roast beef was also available and as good as any you'd find at a $8.99 buffet downtown. Desserts were lackluster and even someone like me who craves sweets, couldn't stomach more than a couple bites. \n\nFor the price we paid for a family of three, I couldn't help but think about all the other places -- buffet or a la carte -- that would have been much more satisfying."

That should not permit them to have only one server working both the bar and dining room. Despite there only being a few other tables, it took 20 minutes to order. I can't blame it on the server, he was doing his best considering he had to take care of the entire restaurant. I'm vegan and ordered off their separate vegan menu. The dish I received was not at all what I ordered and the server tried to play it off as if I didn't know what I ordered. After a few minutes of back and forth the manager came out and explained the server didn't even know they offered the dish I ordered (some kind of quinoa). They took it off the bill and sent out the correct dish. It was probably the worst thing I have ever been served. It was cold, undercooked, and yet very greasy. I will usually just bite my tongue and eat food that isn't great, but this was inedible. I sent it back and ordered some shishito peppers that came out saturated in oil and completely burned and tasted like butane. All I can say is Kerry Simon is far too excellent a Chef to have this sad excuse of a restaurant with his name on it. If it continues in the direction it's headed, they won't be open much longer."

He talked to the manager, but I was so disinterested at this point."

I had the spicy tuna roll as an appetizer and the Chilean sea bass. All of the food was very good and our waiter was very nice. The d\u00e9cor is very pretty. The only downside is that even though it is technically inside, the pool is right next door so there were some very inappropriately dressed women at the bar who were very drunk and very loud. As the sun went down, however, more people dressed up and treated the place as a formal establishment for dinner. We felt like high rollers dining here!"

It was affordable in comparison to strip buffets ($39/adult, $12 kid, 6 and under free. $20 for unlimited, mix and match bloodies, mimosas, bellinis, champagne). Relaxed, friendly atmosphere overlooking the pool. Easy parking. Not packed. Kid items- mouse shaped pancake, cheese pizza, popcorn chicken. For adults- order grilled items off the menu (all were ok- better sounding than tasting) I had the pulled pork Benedict (good pork, very light jalape\u00f1o in the biscuit, bland hollandaise), and chicken fried chicken (dry chicken, gravy ok). There is a small buffet for fruit, pastries, smoothies, green juice, sushi (salmon, a few small rolls, shrimp) and panninis/lox&bagels/crepes, and a bowl of large peel and eat shrimp. Dessert is a fresh pile of cotton candy. It was fun, affordable compared to the strip, and I loved the easy atmosphere. How to be better? They could have better fruit (for that day it was watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew-grocery variety), a few more sushi selections, and maybe oysters, crab, or shrimp I don't have to peel? And/or a warm,carved meat? I like that it's smaller, but they could stand to fancy up the buffet area a little bit with slightly higher end selections. I'd recommend to go with kids if you're looking for something pleasant and easy off the strip, as a one time fun-to-do, or if meeting friends who mostly want to drink in a not-overwhelming atmosphere. I wouldn't go again if the food is the driver."

I had a great Travelzoo dinner deal that included 4 courses, 2 drinks and a VIP bracelet for all the Palms clubs later that night. \n\nSimon to say the least was one of the best meals I have had in Vegas so far. The atmosphere was amazing with an earth-friendly vibe, simple flavors and a striking modern design. Kerry Simon did a wonderful job with this place. \n\nI started out with a lovely Margarita Pizza appetizer, then moved on to a sensational pasta dish which was basic but one of the best I've ever had. The pasta was thick and the sauce was seasoned lightly and matched the overall dish perfectly. I also had to try a side of the signature Mac&Cheese which was with little surprise, absolutely to die for. I ended the meal with one of the most famous deserts in Vegas, the \"Junk Food Platter.\" The so called platter was filled with a hostess cupcake, pink snowball, several assorted cookies, chocolate caramel popcorn in a mini to go box, a mini sundae, rice krisipe treat and a giant puff of cotton candy! Such a creative idea. \n\nI would definitely recommend Simon to anybody in Vegas in search of a great lunch, happy hour or dinner spot. Being a poolside restaurant, there are many options when it comes to your visit and the bar is also impressive to say the least. My visit was completed by running into the one and only George Maloof in the hotel lobby!"

It's located on the 5th floor terrace of Palms Place. Surprisingly, the hostess led us to a table for four tugged away at the corner of the restaurant, overlooking the wrap-around pool through floor-to-ceiling plate glass. We could sit side by side to enjoy the view.\n\nSince we've been drinking cocktails earlier in the afternoon, we did not order any alcohol. Our server was very courteous and friendly, making suggestions and frequently checking on us during the meal. We enjoyed:\n\nShisito Peppers withpozu sauce\nOrganic Rotisserie Chicken with black rice, farro, beet greens, black currants, pine nuts\nGrilled pork chop with candied Brussels sprout tempura\n\nSimon gives you generous portions. We didn't finish the shisito peppers, who came in a 8 oz bowl. They were tasty but spicy. Both the chicken and pork chop were delicious, but nothing special. The candied Brussels sprouts were a tad greasy but they were perfect comfort food. Pork chop was not cooked all the way through and was tender.\n\nThey had a nice sashimi and sushi bar, except it didn't to me that Simon is a destination for Japanese cuisine so I never tried.  \n\nThis is a slick place, with nice atmosphere and friendly staff.

My friend had made a reservation, which I'm glad she did since that was the day of the NBA Playoffs and the place was beginning to fill up at around 5:30 p.m. Our hostess seated us at a small table suited more for two people. We had to steal an extra chair, but no prob.\n\nWe each ordered a few items to share. Here's what we went with:\n\nFOOD\n\n- Depp Fried Calamari with Shishito Peppers: Deep fried calamari rings which weren't chewy at all. The peppers were a nice compliment to the calamari. This came with a side of dipping sauce, but I thought the calamari was better off with just a spritz of lime juice. \n\n- Shishito Peppers: Just loved munching on these, but not as much as my friend who ate half the bowl. Great to much on in between sampling the different food. \n\n- Shrimp Tempura Roll: This was OK. I've had better. \n\nPigs in a Blanket: Mini beef sausages \"blanketed\" with flaky pastry dough. Comes with Sriracha ketchup and mustard. \n\n- Crab Cake with Asian Slaw: Believe it or not, this actually made from real crab and none of that imitation stuff. Topped with \"Asian Slaw\", which is essentially shredded radish. I thought this was a little on the small side to be sharing with others. \n\n- Chicken and Arugula Pizza: Thin, flat, and crispy. This personal size pizza was topped with goat cheese, chicken, arugula, and sprinkled with sea salt. Tasty!\n\n- Dessert: The waitress brought out dessert on the house! We received an assorted dessert plate and cotton candy. I grabbed a rice crispy square, chocolate chip cookie, and what looked like a Hostess cupcake. The cookie was the best part with its large chocolate chunks. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but I would've liked to have eaten it straight from the oven, or at least warm it up in the microwave. The rice crispy treat was on the tough side; I was expecting it to be chewier. As for the cupcake I'd rather have a Hostess. \n\nSERVICE\n\nDespite the restaurant being busy and packed full of basketball fans, our waitress never forgot about us, and came to our table to often to see if we were doing well. Our only complaint the servers didn't stagger our orders upon our request, so most of our food came out all at once and we barely had any room. It's all good, and we managed just fine.\n\nSIDE NOTE: \n\nIf you come here on Thursdays you'll have a chance to attend the Duck Party outside.

Went w a gf , we've both had dinner there before but never brunched there .\nFirst of all I love  the pajama dress code for the wait staff..and they all had nice pajamas, not like Wal Mart shoppers lol! \nThe mimosas (grapefruit vs oj) were perfect & our waiter kept them flowing. \nWe ordered the lobster havarti Benedict which I read other yelp reviews about. HOLY WOW this was sooooo good. An amazing Benedict version I will never forget! It's so good! \nWe didn't eat much from the buffet as the crepes weren't that amazing and we both own vitamix so we passed on smoothies or juices. \nSo my 4 stars are based on the service, mimosas, menu items , ambiance, and lovely view of the pool as we dine."

            "review": "This review is specifically for brunch at Simon on Sunday mornings. I have not tried this restaurant at other times.\n\nOK so - I totally love Simon for Sunday brunch for a couple of reasons.\n\n#1 - Awesome alcohol options! I don't even drink that much these days, BUT, when I do, these are great options. Their Bloody Mary bar is second to NONE! You simply pay $10 - $15 and are handed a huge glass with ice & vodka in it. I'd say there about 50-75 different kinds of hot sauces to choose from. They even have Slim Jim sticks!\n\nIf Bloody Marys aren't your thing, then simply choose the champagne option for about the same price. Hidden bonus? You can go hang out by the pool ALL DAY and keep drinking!\n\n#2 - Brunch - their brunch options are fabulous and pretty healthy for your typical brunch. Lots of different things to choose from - everything from bagels & lox to wheatgrass smoothies. \n\n#3 - Brunch \"Dessert\" - if you ask your server, they'll bring you the most awesome candy dessert, which includes cotton candy!\n\n#4 - The pool - yeah most people don't think of this but you get access to the pool area with brunch. So come, stay all afternoon and relax!\n\nI try to come here every time I come to Vegas. Big fan."

I was there with a large party of 8 and they happily split our checks for us without a hassle. \nEveryone enjoyed their meals while listening to good music, and had some cute wait staff.

My friend ordered the red chicken curry and said it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I ordered the chicken with risotto and it too was ridiculously bland.  I typically don't add salt and pepper to my food and I was quick to reach for both.  The chicken was cooked well, but that was its only redeeming quality.  Our server/bartender was very friendly, but he was acting as both the bartender and sole server on a Saturday night.  Needless to say, the service was slow.  Although, I don't believe that was his fault.  More of a lack of staff issue.  We were all very disappointed by our experience and when I return to Vegas I will steer clear of Simon."

It was exactly as it was described - fried but with a creamy sauce. \n\nI had the rainbow roll. It was okay. Nothing spectacular. \n\nMy friends and I sat at the bar. Fabian and Becky were at the bar serving us. The hostess claimed the restaurant was booked, but there were hardly any people in there. Fabian and Becky were nice and attentive.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small. The windows face the roof pool and cabanas, which are also small. This is the only restaurant in Palm's Place. It's across from Drift Spa. \n\nWe only went to this place because we had credit during our stay. I probably wouldn't go back unless we had another credit."

Theo, the General Manager, was very apologetic, but the girl working the front desk had a major attitude problem.\n\nOh well, the food, ambiance, and service were excellent. We ordered the Edamame and Cucumber rolls as appetizer. The Edamame is out of this world. They wok fry the Edamame and then toss it with some lime and Tagorashi. The Cucumber Rolls were nothing special.\n\nI ordered a thin crust Spinach pizza as an entree, while my friend had the Citrus braised short ribs. That was probably the best thin crust pizza I've had ever. The crust was light and chewy, just the way I like my pizza crust. I don't eat meat, but my friend couldn't stop raving about the Short ribs. \n\nTo compensate for the wait, they brought out a huge bowl of cotton candy and a huge slice of the Banana chocolate pie for us to share. I'm not big on dessert's either, but my friend devoured everything in under 10 minutes. I can definitely see myself dining here again. Do give it a try."

I enjoyed both very much! \n\nWent there for dinner on Friday night, we changed our reservation time a couple times cause we couldn't be sure when we could get there, but the host girl was so nice, she accommodated us a good table when we got there, a window seat with good views of the pools, just what I requested. \n\nOrdered a \"blueberry blush\" specialty cocktail, it was so tasty, liked it a lot, followed by a grey goose dry martini, I was a little buzzed. Liked the menu, they have a sushi & sashimi menu too. \n\nOur dinner food: \nComplimentary assorted bread basket with warm butter: so delicious! Loved the sweet ones \n\nSimon sashimi scallops: flamed scallops were very tender, delicious \n\nMackerel & salmon egg sashimi: very fresh, yummy \n\nEdamame, wok charred: a little burned outside, but they were still yummy, great to snack on while waiting for our food\n\nLobster miso soup: very delicious \n\nFilet Mignon with mushrooms: hubby loved it so much, the sauce was great, the mushrooms were so yummy! \n\nSide order of seasonal veggies and mushrooms with roasted garlic cloves: the veggies were OK, the mushrooms and garlic were so good! So flavorful! \n\nOur waiter was so nice, he was so attentive, made sure everything was great with us, we had a great relaxing dinner there, tab was $175. And I want to thank him for having the host girl call front desk about our suite, it was not ready at the time we tried to check in, he even asked them to give us credit towards to our dining, so nice of him!\n\nThe Sunday brunch was amazing too, all the servers wore Paul Frank pajamas! How cute! Loved the Bloody Mary buffet, they have a whole bunch of hot sauces and pickled veggies to put in! \n\nI loved it they have sushi & sashimi bar, loved the spicy tuna rice cake, smoked salmon, salmon sashimi, they were so fresh! We could order from the menu too, Benedicts like lobster havarti, steak hash were so yummy, BBQ pork baby back ribs were great, hubby loved those. \n\nThe desert was amazing! The cotton candy was heaven, there was a candy bar in the front of the restaurant, so many assorted candies and chocolates. \n\nBrunch buffet for two with a Bloody Mary buffet and sparkling water was $92. I absolutely loved it! \n\nWow Simon! My new favorite restaurant in Vegas! Loved the casual relaxing atmosphere, great service and delicious food!"

For $39/person, there was a limited menu in my opinion.  You have to order most of the dishes and the waitress brings it out for you.  I tried the Lobster Havarti and Margarita Pizza which were both just ok.  There is also all you can eat salmon and yellowtail sashimi, but they weren't as fresh as I had hoped.  Overall, it's probably only worth it for someone who can eat a LOT (and not a little Asian girl like me lol)"

The food is still delicious and the service is outstanding. However, there was a hiccup last night. We had reservations and arrived an hour early to have drinks with friends in the bar. We still had to wait about 45 minutes for our table, which was kind of annoying because like I mentioned, we had reservations AND arrived early. \n\nThe bar area is very classy, with comfortable bar stools and cozy lounge seating (trust me since this was where I spent the majority of my time last night).\n\nThe food is outstanding - between all of us we had a little bit of everything (check out my pictures). I accidentally knocked over a bellini (thanks to being relegated to the bar for nearly 2 hours pre-dinner I suppose???) and my server promptly replaced it. He also brought us some spicy tuna on crispy rice to try which was fabulous!\n\nDespite the fact that I've eaten here for years and will continue to do so in the future, I got really sick a few hours after eating here last night (and it wasn't alcohol related). After enjoying our dinner, we went and danced at The Playboy Club, then headed over to the Ghost Bar, and had to leave abruptly because I was feeling ill. I'm pretty sure it was the gravy on the meatloaf."

The female bartender brought a drink menu and never returned. She was at the opposite end of the bar doing squats or something as the other bartender totally had his back to us and was busy chatting her up instead of following up with his patrons. I literally had to walk over to the bar and ask for service as my attempts to capture their attention did not seem to be working. Finally it was time to be seated in the restaurant for our dinner appointment. They seated us by a party of 6, which wasn't bad and seemed kinda spacious. The waiter took our appetizer order of lump crab cakes and then later the main entree order. I had the rib-eye and my guest had the sushi sampler. Our entree beat the appetizer to our table and the guy looked puzzled when I spoke up and said, \"that's a little late, its suppose to be our appetizer\" as we were beginning to eat our main course. He didn't even respond, just looked at me and left it on our table, along with the menus/drink menus that were still in our way. My steak was cooked to order, however it lacked taste and seasoning, as well as the bland mashed potatoes. As we were trying to just make the most of the meal, the other waiters that were servicing the party of 6, felt necessary to keep bumping our table in hast, without an apology or an \"excuse me or I'm sorry\"."

It's tucked away above the hotel lobby near the front entrance/parking garage area. Luckily for me, I finally found Simon right before Happy Hour was about to end (Mon - Thu: 5pm - 7pm; Fri - Sun: 3pm - 6pm). \n\nMy friend and I sat at the bar and delved into the HH Menu. I decided on the Mac n' Cheese ($8) while she opted for the Shrimp Tempura ($8). The bartender, Mark, is officially my favorite bartender in Las Vegas. My tipsy friend, after ordering a Guinness, was rambling on about how Guinness and cookies are supposedly an awesome pairing. A minute later, Mark came by and dropped off two chocolate cookies for us. What a nice guy! He went back and forth with us, going along with our drunken antics. I was laughing my ass off the entire time we were at the bar. He did an awesome job at keeping my glass filled with water (I was so dehydrated!). You rock, Mark!\n\nTruffled Macaroni and Cheese: This mac n' cheese was delicious! Perfectly cheesy and I loved the ground black pepper in it. My friend kept trying to steal some from the bowl.\n\nAmbiance: Chandeliers = Fancy. The vibe felt upscale and modern. We were dressed in costumes but I would want to dress up a little here.\n\nReturn visit? Sure! I had fun at Simon's restaurant and would definitely get the truffled macaroni and cheese again.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #15"

For about $10 more, you can have all you can drink bloody mary or champagne bevies.\n\nOk - let's be honest.  The food is just decent... not amazing.  Depending on what you order, sometimes it's disappointing.  (you can break a tooth on the fried chicken for example.)  But you can have a lot of it.  So if you're coming here just for food, maybe you should try something else.  \n\nThe service was good however... Our waiter did a great job keeping up with Chris.

It is poolside dining at its finest, most stylish, and most sinfully sweet. (And, I haven't even tried the desserts!)\n\nI have been here on two occasions, and neither occasion was a full-on sit down dinner, but rather a hang with peeps enjoying some light bites. I will admit that this type of dining does not demand a high level of service, but the bartender, who served as our waiter, was friendly and knowledgeable. He made several recommendations that were all spot on. Because of that, last night our light bites transformed into a full meal, as we couldn't resist ordering more of some of our favorite things!\n\nWhat are a few of our favorite things?\n1. Crispy Sesame Rice: A must! The perfect bar food bite (if you like spicy tuna). It is a delectable marriage between spicy tuna and a mini, salty rice crispy treat. The flavor is crave worthy, as I am craving it right now. We ordered 3 rounds of these bad, by which I mean good, mamas. \n2. Edamame: Forget what your Japanese mama told you cuz this stuff blew my edamame expectation outta the water. It is wok charred. Translation: A brilliant grilled flavor infused into every tasty little pod.\n3. Spinach Pizza: Yum-azing. Apparently, Mr. Simon got his cooking start in the pizza world, so he takes his pie very seriously. It shows. The crust was the perfect chewy/crispy combo, and the boursin cheese on top was tempting me to lick that stuff right off. \n4. Calamari: Some places don't respect calamari. It has become like the potato skin for foodies, but not here. Nice, thick rings, perfectly battered with a flavor that survives the fry.  \n\nAs far as those four items go, the flavors were top notch. Nothing made my palette angry, and despite the creativity, I never felt that something sacrificed taste for show. Again, I have not experienced a full sit down meal here, but for me, it is definitely now at the top of my list for a round of drinks and nibbles at a hip hang. \n\nUseful notes: They have sushi happy hour every day from 4-7pm. And all day, every day locals can enjoy $4 beer, $6 well drinks, and $7 glasses of wine. That is a screaming deal for such a swank establishment."

Dinner service was excellent and everything we ordered was very good: sushi, steak, lamb, pizza.. Brunch service was a bit slow but the buffet was chock full of good things to try. I had the biscuits and gravy which was a perfect portion and seasoned very well. I probably could have eaten another order of them, but instead tried a smoothie and some of their backed goods... the blueberry muffin was one of the best I've ever had."

The service was mediocre, before I was served my entry the busboy tried to take my bread plate with my bread still on it, I had to grab it back from him. I was taking my girl friend there and we were both dressed up and would have felt better with jeans and a T Shirt. I was embarrassed for her and myself as we were expecting a nice romantic place and it was just the opposite. We were on a special package which include desert. The desert came with cotton candy a couple of cookies , pretty stupid I would think. The food was good  but not worth the price ."

            "review": "Had somewhat high expectations of SImon based on other reviews.  Called to make a reservation for 2 at 8pm on a Sunday.  Hostess asked if we could do 7:45, sure no problem.  Got there at 7:45 and the place was nearly EMPTY.   Why couldn't I reserve a table at 8pm when there as maybe 5 other tables in the entire place that were occupied?  The atmosphere is great, very modern and overlooks a lit pool which gives nice ambiance.   Ordered the fried calamari for an app, very good.   GF ordered the sirloin and I wanted the ribeye.  Nope.  Out of ribeye.  So I asked him what else was the best on the menu and he said the black cod.  Sure Ill try it.  Loaded with fennel and undercooked.  Yuck.  The Sirloin was OK but was not cooked well.  Went from medium rare on one end of the steak to well done on the other.  Had a show to catch so no time to send it back.  Overall a disappointment.  If you have one place to try while in Vegas go to Sage, which was great."

            "review": "I was staying at The Palms Place, where the restaurant is, and so my group of girl friends went to Simon for dinner.  The decor was very modern, and the restaurant was pretty empty for a 730pm dinner reservation on a busy weekend, but I enjoyed our relaxing dinner despite the hectic strip.\n\nThe menu was pretty confusing - sushi, fusion food, pizzas, seafood, American. Everything seemed to be somewhat Asian inspired, except the pizzas.  We got a little bit of everything: calamari, Margarita pizza, crispy creamy shrimp, cucumber sushi, cotton candy and creme brulee and a bunch more dishes (I didn't eat all of them, so I can't recall all of them). My favorite was the crispy creamy shrimp, which is funny since I don't eat a ton of seafood. It was a great app to share with friends. The food came out in a timely manner, and the staff was friendly. It was pretty pricey, and the food was good but nothing too exciting that I would definitely want to come back here again.\n\nI would say this is a good place for a nice dinner in Vegas, especially if you are staying at The Palms or one of its other hotels, but there is a lot more exciting places you can eat in Vegas."

            "review": "LOVE THE BRUNCH!!! We went here with a group for Sunday brunch. The food was fantastic and the service better. We ate eggs benedict, waffles and fried chicken,  and sushi to you name it. They had jumbo shrimp and fantastic french toast. We had a large group that wanted to hang out and talk all day. Our server totally did not care that we sat there all day. He also continued to pour champagne and refill our water long after we finished eating. We did have newcomers throughout that ate and ordered cocktails. But generally you wear out your welcome quickly after your meal is finished. I can not say how much I enjoyed this place. I'm not sure if Kerry Simon being present helped or if it is always this good. Although I have also had lunch while at the Palms Place spa and food was great then too. Take your group this Sunday and have a great afternoon. Make sure and have cotton candy and snowballs for dessert."

            "review": "I loved Kerry Simon's restaurant when it was in the Hard Rock, and I love his restaurants in LA. It's very consistent and just comforting, knowing you're going to get good food. So, the fact that this place is in Palm's Place is a little sad - off the Strip and not even in the Palms...the restaurant and the food deserves better.\n\nThe restaurant itself is divided into separate parts, and doesn't make for a cohesive space. It's just weird...atmosphere, separation from the bar and kitchen and main dining area...I don't know, it just felt odd and disjointed. The main area itself is beautiful and everything I expected, but that's not where we sat, so... *shrug*\n\nThat said, I have to say I was a little disappointed...but left Simon's happy, mostly because of our waitress. There was really no explanation for it, but the kitchen was backed up...food was S.L.O.W. in coming...as were the drinks. From what I could tell, it wasn't that packed, not not other restaurants on the Strip that week.\n\nThe food, once we got it, was great. It always is with Kerry Simon's restaurants. There's something to be said about consistency. So, our waitress pretty much made sure we weren't too aware of the delays from the kitchen...and to make up for it, comped us a few drinks as well as dessert. She even helped out my colleagues who were in a different part of the restaurant.\n\nGood food, better service...makes all the difference in the world."

Sushi was just ok, the cereal french toast was super yummy. Service was just so-so. Our waitress was annoyed when I asked for something with a candle for my friend. For 40 bucks a person you can do much better!\n\n\nReprieve from recent review- Simon Happy Hour rocks. The Bartenders were awesome as well as $6 menu of various cocktails and eats like any flavored vodka, yellowtail sushi and edamame. We have been back a few times this place from 430-7 will impress and have you coming back for more."
