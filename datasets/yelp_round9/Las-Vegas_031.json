I mean, Vegas, in August...shorts are pretty much standard.  But they will only let you sit outside unless you're wearing a tuxedo.  Or maybe just long pants.  Anyways, it was fine, view of the pool, and all the creepy-ass-birds, like from Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Raven\" staring you down.  Or literally drinking water out of the water pitcher that the busboys fill up the guests water glasses with.  We saw.  We gave the heads up that the birds had been drinking from it.  I hope they changed the water.\n\nI had a RAD meal.  First we got the Truffle Fries, which were doused in this amazing, creamy, decadent savory truffle sauce.  Not like most places where they just sprinkle some truffle oil on the fries and toss some parmesan on top.  This was amazing.  Like gain 5lbs by looking at it, amazing.\n\nI got the Shrimp Crab and Lobster Club sandwich.  Again, off the charts.  I was stuffed, I could only eat one of the 4 pieces.  But thankfully we left Vegas at like 12:30, the worst time ever to leave, and got back to Oceanside 9 hours later.  Epic timing on our part.  So I had the rest of it in the car later.  It was still amazing then.  I got the green salad with the vinaigrette.  Good, not earth shattering but good.\n\nThe fool that wore SHORTS to brunch in August, in Vegas...he got the TPC Burger.  It will light a fire inside your soul.  \n\nI got the endless champagne package, with Bellinis.  Our server was super attentive and made sure I had enough booze.  She checked if we had any food allergies, and was very all-around great.  \n\nI took away a star for the damn birds.  They're super irritating, there's bird shit here and there, they eat scraps, they drink the water from the pitcher your water might be from, they are fucking LOUD too.  \n\nWe'd go back if we stay at the Wynn again.  Food was excellent.  Endless Champagne is always welcome in my body."

The vegan waffles with fruit were the best I have ever eaten. They have plenty of vegan options and each one we tried was delightful. Our meat eaters, vegan and vegetarian all found something they wanted and enjoyed thoroughly. The staff were attentive and friendly, the view of the pool is lovely, and the decor is bright and elegant. We will definitely visit again when we are in town."

My husband ordered the pulled pork benedict and I ordered the lobster benedict along with a mimosa and sangria and it was amazing! It was rich in taste and something I had never seen on a breakfast menu. will definitely be returning on my next trip!"

            "review": "Fancy-shmancy cafe with good food and a great ambiance, but way too pricey. What can you expect at the Wynn I guess right? We decided to check out Terrace Pointe since none of us were hungry enough for the buffet (it's literally right across from it). It wasn't too busy, but we opted for an outside table so we had a short wait. Btw, if the weather is good, I highly recommend sitting outside. It overlooks the pool and it's just really nice and relaxing.\n\nService is on point and the food is good, but the prices are steep. A BBQ burger already costs $17 and it doesn't even come with anything! You have to pay an extra $4 to add a side of fries. The prices for alcohol aren't cheap either. $12 for a michelada and $21 for a bottomless mimosa. Last I checked, this was just a cafe! I guess you're paying for the presentation and for the atmosphere, but dangg. For what I paid, I might as well have just gone to the buffet!\n\nBottom line, go for the lovely outside seating and the relaxing environment. It's perfect after a night out and the food isn't bad. But when you're paying over $70 for just two burgers, one side of fries, and essentially 2 beers, I'll probably pass next time."

I was not so thrilled with the hash browns (they reminded me of cafeteria hash browns).  The menu has much to offer and the kobe beef sliders are very good!!!  I also forgot to mention that the waffle we had was perfectly made.\nI would give it 3.5 stars!!!"

When we sat down, the waiter arrived and served us our drinks right away.  Here is where the problems started occurring . We waited 20 minutes for the server to come to place our order.  By the time I had placed my order, I was full off of the OJ.  Once I ordered, I waited another 25 minutes for my food to come out.  I had ordered the New York Steak and it was cooked inside correctly, but unfortunately, it was cold.  The plate was hotter than the steak.  My sides were horrendous as they were bland and cold as well.  I don't think I'll be eating here again. By the way, I'm not that hard to please as I spent the weekend eating Nathan's Hot Dogs and Panda Express.  That should testify how bad the food/service here was!"

The name Terrance Pointe Cafe had me thinking I would be dining at a casual \"blah\" cafe, Nope this is 5 star quality food & service. They are very generous with the food portions & price is very reasonable. The food was excellent but our server was the best. Sytuan (Sy) is the best server around. He made our dining experience so much fun. Our busboy named Francisco (Pancho) was on top of it all. We never had to ask for refills. They were both so attentive. We had the bottomless mimosas & they kept them coming. It was so good we came back the next day for brunch again. I will come here every time I am in Vegas now!"

The portion was filling.\n\nOptions: lots of options for vegan and vegetarians. There is a separate vegetarian menu, but if you're vegan, you need to specify. The waitress also asked me about any allergies I had, which was nice. \n\nService + Atmosphere: We were seated right away for lunch service. Our waitress, Elicet, was so kind and helpful.

            "review": "I know this place has gotten a lot of bad reviews but I really liked the restaurant. Originally my sister and I were going to go to the Wynn for the breakfast buffet but we found out it was the Saturday brunch and not a regular buffet, so I remembered about Terrace Pointe and we headed there. Actually a lot of people ended up venturing over to Terrace Pointe because of the non-buffet. \n\nFrom the time we walked into the restaurant to the time we sat at our table was about 10 min. which was great. The ambiance is nice, quaint and very \"Wynn\". The menu was short and sweet - pancakes, waffles, fruit, pastries, etc. I ordered the strawberry belgian waffle, my sister got pancakes. My waffle was great! So delicious - crispy, flavorful, the strawberries were fresh and the whipped cream was yummy. My sister's pancakes were huge, she couldn't even finish them. \n\nThe only minus is it took a good while for our food to come.  Luckily we weren't starving, because if we were I would have been a lil ticked off at having to wait so long. Overall I really liked my food, it was a great alternative to the breakfast buffet. I will definetly go back on my next trip to Las Vegas."

In New Zealand, home to arguably the world's best cafe-based eggs Benedict creator people, I had a lot of eggs Benedict and not one cafe produced an eggs Benedict that achieved an overall score of less than 9/10. Having established my credentials on this issue, I can say beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt that the Terrace Pointe Cafe eggs Benedict easily achieves a eggs Benedict score of 9.5/10."

Two of our friends have very strictly held beliefs against eating meat, specifically pork. They ordered huevos rancheros from the vegan menu and we were horrified to discover they had given her the wrong dish, and she ended up eating pork for the first time in 28 years. The staff didn't realize how important this was for her, they tried to make up for it by comping her meal but unfortunately nothing can take back her experience of eating pork and breaking a lifetime of commitment to her religious beliefs. She was mortified, and was unable to continue with brunch. She was visibly distraught and tearful. They offered to call security to make some type of incident report but after an hour no one showed up. I'm just so shocked because what if his was a life threatening food allergy? This place needs to be more conscious and aware of dietary restrictions of their guests. It's safe to say I will not be coming back. Nothing and no comps can make up for what was taken from her. Anyone who holds strongly held beliefs will understand this."

            "review": "You know, when I am dining at a 5 star hotel, forgive me... but I am expecting to be impressed and pampered.\n\nNot here.  This place was horrid.  \n\nLets begin with the 2 airheaded hostesses who stood there for 5 minutes and talked to each other while we waited to be seated.  Ok, I understand that they've got a whole complicated system going of how to seat people, but they at least could have told us how long it was going to be rather than ignoring us.\n\nThe real trouble began when we finally sat at our table.  10 minutes after we had decided what we were ordering and closed our menus to give the signal, I had to flag down one of the bussers to notify whoever our server was so we could order.   Well, he must have forgotton because it took another 5 for our waitress to come.  The restaurant was not busy at this time (3:30pm), mind you.  Yes, we hadn't even been greeted yet.  We didn't even have water.  Again people: a FIVE star hotel we're talking about here.\n\nAfter ordering, we had to ask for bread 3 times...we had to send one soup back because it was the wrong one...just to send the correct soup back because it tasted so poor...they forgot my friends mojito...and I had to get up and walk to another table to steal some extra silverware because I couldn't flag down anyone who worked there.  Our busser, John, was the only one who seemed to have it together, but he was really busy holding the place down since everyone else wasn't helping.\n\nIn the end, we actually asked John if he could send a manager over so we could complain because our experience was so bad, and she ended up comping the entire meal after hearing about all of the inconsistencies and disappointments.  I would feel guilty about this at an independent restaurant, but c'mon.  This is the WYNN we're talking about!  They should have every aspect of the way they run their ANYTHING down to an art by now.  No excuse.  And, this was a TREND at the Wynn.  Very disappointed with the Wynn's service...not just here but also at Okada and Red as well.  Even the convenience store's service was whack!\n\nThe only reason I am giving 2 stars is because that bloody mary came in clutch, and my french fries were good."

The waffles were excellent. They were dusted lightly with powdered sugar & served with vegan butter. It comes with BBQ syrup, which is an acquired taste; it was ok, but I prefer maple syrup, which they'll provide upon request. The \"chicken\" was ok. It was was nicely fried & crunchy, but it could use a tad more flavor/seasoning in its crust/batter. The country potatoes were excellent & full of flavor. The sausage was ok; nothing special.\n\nThis was a lot of food. It lasted me 2 days. \n\nIt was a nice restaurant with a classy ambiance. The employees were friendly, attentive, and knowledgable re their vegan offerings. \n\nAs for the dress code, think business casual. \n\nThe next time I'm in Vegas, I'll return here to try more of their vegan options."

I've had much better poached eggs (for example, at the Original Pancake House), the potatoes tasted like they'd tried to \"make 'em all fancy\" but failed. The sausage was pretty poor, but perhaps that's because I was expecting more of a \"breakfast sausage\" than standard mini-sausages. The service was nothing to brag about - they did the job but that's about it. I wouldn't have gone twice (or, let's be honest, probably be going again tomorrow morning) except that I'm at a conference at the Wynn and it's right downstairs. Might be better if you have something else, though my colleague really wasn't thrilled with his poached salmon breakfast dish either."

What a shame because it has so much potential and there is no excuse for such a mediocre execution at such an establishment.  I had the alfredo with shrimp and it resembled and tasted like a tv dinner!  I could have had better at The Olive Garden!  It was smothered with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and was just bad-period.  My bf had the Philly cheesesteak and that too was a disaster.  How can you mess up a hot sandwich?  Th only decent thing we had was the salad caprese, which was actually good.  What a waste of $ and the nice pool view!"

The food is pretty awesome, decently priced, and the setting is what you expect from the Wynn.\n\nThe food here is breakfast and lunch fare. I really like the Tandoori chicken wrap and the greek salad. They pull both of those off very well. Every friend I bring here ends up leaving satisfied with the food. None of it is mind-blowing, but its solid, reliable, quasi-gourmet. \n\nBut the best thing about this place is that YOU (yes...YOU!) can afford to eat at the Wynn! ...if you eat here. Granted, everything is about $3 over-priced, but you pay for the surroundings, which are Wynn-tastic.\n\nIf you sit indoors, you sit on faux-french chairs or couches, surrounded by fancy colored drapes and lighting which are familiar to the entire interior of the casino. But the real winner here is if you can eat outside on the patio. There, you sit directly beneath (and in the shade provided by)  the behemoth Wynn tower overlooking the pool area. And at the Wynn, the pool area is really worth seeing (even if you can't stay there). The table umbrellas even have misters on the corners to keep you cool when it's 108 degrees outside."

I had one of each so I could try them all and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Lobster was pretty good, but the pulled pork was definitely the best. The traditional was ok. The hollandaise sauce was good and overall it was just ok for an eggs benedict connoisseur like myself.  Once you add in the pricetag of $60 for people for breakfast it made it not worth it.

I'll admit, it was a tad bit awkward. But who knows, we're probably the awkward ones brunching at their pool. Since we were outside, there were quite a few birds - mid-meal, one actually flew through the space between our table and the umbrella. I particularly appreciated the mist spraying out of the umbrellas, but the misting seemed to stop as our meal progressed and the heat intensified.\n\nOnto food & drink! We ordered the Terrace Pointe Sunrise (sourish) & the Key Lime Pie Smoothie (sweetish). Both were on point and I'm very interested to try other drink items.\n\nI was ecstatic that there was a Benedict trio on the menu - I didn't have to make a commitment to just one Benedict! On the side, we ordered both the skillet potatoes (very thick-cut potato chips) and hash browns (cube of shredded potato that was fried on top & bottom), which came out before the rest of our meal. Though the portions were sizable, neither potato sides were very crispy. I also can't say the classic or turkey-avo Benedicts were very memorable either.

The venue itself is quite pretty but it was ridiculously crowded and there was a line where we waited about 30 minutes first, and then another 20 to be seated outdoors. When we were given a choice to be seated immediately indoors we decided to wait and have a couple mimosas at the bar. \n\nPeggy at the bar around Jan 18th Saturday noonish was a horribly unprofessional and sullen bartender. She first off messed up an order and brought over an extra mimosa which I didn't argue with and just paid for despite her just apparently ordering drinks for customers. When I gave her my credit card to charge, It went through and I signed, and then about 5 minutes later she comes back to me and asks for my card back so she can swipe it again. I asked why since I've already got the receipt, gave her her tip and signed for the previous transaction. She gave me this bullshit murmur of an excuse and said it didn't go through blabhlah and aggressively took it from me and swiped again, I asked for the receipt again since I didn't keep the first one and checked with her I wouldn't be charged again. It's been over a week since she's run my card twice on one drink and both charges are up on my credit card. Also, the mimosa was seriously less than mediocre, gave me a headache with whatever cheap champagne and concentrate orange juice they've used, and it was $10 each. It's fine though, worth it to pay $20 for a shitty mimosa so I can learn my lesson to never ever come back here again and discourage others from having a shit experience. \n\nAside from this issue, this place ridiculously overpriced their low quality food items. I ordered a $16 truffle omelette, and it was a sloppy, greasy mess, an omelette from Denny's or IHOP would have been better and half the price. My bf ordered the truffle burger which was $18 and that was also a mediocre burger, not even worth mentioning or recommending to others. Our friends also ordered other items and the one who ordered the vegetarian burger that was really cheap and came with fries and a chocolate milk shake really got crappy food. Like, the burger was lower in quality than one from Mcdonalds or Burger King. I shit you not, they used like worse bread than they use at a horrible fast food chain which is just unbelievable.\n\nThe service was also just meh, as our server was extremely busy and pretty inattentive. It took FOREVER to pay for our meal because she wouldn't come back to return the credit cards. \n\nThe terrace was right by the pool and that was ok, they have some really loud imported birds and they are forward as fuck. Watch for them swooping in your face to grab food off your fork. They were also extremely loud and high pitched to the point of being distracting and annoying. They cafe also failed with the shading issue, my bf and I had a sunburn from eating lunch, because they took forever with every step of the process and secondly due to insufficient umbrellas up near the tables.

In Vegas.  I challenge you to find another free wi-fi place on the strip.  Well, besides the ice cream place on the Wynn.  Another free wi-fi place on the strip outside of the Wynn."

Decent food, with a couple of unique items. Portions are generous. Service is very good to so-so. The room sits over the pool area and has a very plush, opulent feel. It's a big step up from Denny's but not really of the caliber of food that's served throughout the rest of the hotel. If they're going to charge $13 for ham and eggs, a little extra punch in the presentation would be nice."

The service and ambiance are top-notch, but the food was subpar.\n\nThree out of four in our group had eggs, all prepared over-easy or sunny-side-up.  One egg came out with a broken, cooked egg yolk so we asked if they could provide another egg over-easy.  You'd think they'd catch this before bringing the food out.  They brought out two new eggs but the egg whites were way under-cooked - completely disgusting.  \n\nI had the Eggs Benedict.  They just weren't good at all.  Pretty tasteless.\n\nWe had eaten here once before and had a great meal, but I don't think we'll be returning.  Breakfast, in my opinion, is one of the easiest meals to not screw up, especially with a simple egg order.  I expect better when they're charging more than $15 for eggs."

The service was a bit slow... I'm guessing a lot of people have the \"monday flu\" after a busy weekend!  None the less the food was really terrific.  First and foremost they had a healthy fresh green juice that I love and enjoy so that was a treat.  I ordered trio of eggs benediict and except for a couple of minor things, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfect sauce.  Pefectly poached eggs.  One had lobster and it was simply overcooked.  That came with corn and green been hash that was fresh, fresh, fresh and perfectly al dente.  One of the trios was with pork belly on a bisquit.  It may have been pork belly but i think most people would know it as thick cut bacon.  Tasty but not the slow cooked, soft and uber fatty pork belly I've had elsewhere.\n\nMy criticisms are really minor. I darn near licked the plate clean.  (and might have it no on was looking!)

I took away one star for service - depending on when you go the line can be long ever if there appears to be a number of tables open, and the wait for the food can be rather lengthy. A lot of people seem to stop here for one last meal before dashing off to the airport (not recommended) - and I've often seen people hurrying through meals and jumping up to try to chase down a server so they can get off to the taxi line.  I've also seen some rather tense exchanges between servers and customers over how long the process was taking.\n\nStill, if you have the time this is a great place to eat - especially outside on the patio or if you go later at night when the crowds have thinned out. The line is almost always shorter than the Wynn Buffet line."

Unfortunately we failed to plan ahead properly and account for the two hour wait, and that led us to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  Despite being called a cafe, the decor was very fancy(though the staff wasn't uptight).  Outside of a bit of a  wait while they setup a table for our group of 7, we all came out thinking that this was one of our most pleasurable dining experiences.\n\nEveryone in our group was very satisfied with our food(though we all selected heavier non-cafe fare).  Each dish had excellent attention to detail, especially with garnish(for example the fish and chips came in fake newspaper with silly articles on them).  I personally had the salmon and the french onion soup, both of which were fantastic.\n\nOur waitress(Jamie) deserves special mention.  She was very personable, quoted movies with us, and would add witty commentary at opportune moments(plus she put up with our occasionally rambunctious behavior).  She catered to our every need, from those that we requested(asking for faster pacing due to time constraints) and those that we didn't request(bringing out extra sticks of rock candy when one member of our party obsessing over them after seeing someone else get one with the coffee)."

Then, our food came!... yes, the price point is higher (it is the Wynn, afterall) but I think you get comparable portions. By the time we were full, we realized that- had it not been a professional occasion- we probably could have gone without 1 or 2 of the dishes. I'll definitely be going back.

What a wonderful place to wonder what my life would've been like had I known what I wanted to do with my life at the age of 8, put my plan into action at 13 & had then done so well in high school that I was accepted into a college so prestigious that I was able to secure a high paying job right after graduation. If only, if only. \n\nFor those of us unable to afford the luxurious accommodations that the Wynn provides, eating at their restaurants comes as the next best option. \n\nI was under the impression that such a grandiose establishment would therefore provide a red carpet experience equipped with only the best wait staff & recipes with ingredients fit to kill. Man oh man, was I wrong. \n\nThe terrace cafe is a beautiful brunch spot with an outdoor area that makes you feel like a queen despite your annual income, but this exhausts the list of good things I have to say about this outdoor hot spot. \n\nAs queen, I banish server Nicole & her TCP burger from this kingdom. Off with their heads! (kidding)\n\nBut not really. Nicole was a terrible server.. which surprised me given that the Wynn has a very extensive application/interview process & typically does a great job at weeding out the men from the boys. \n\nMy mom & I came here on a Saturday morning and decided to split an entree.. the TCP burger with a side of sweet potatoe fries, along with a Pepsi & a vanilla latte. Besides the 15 minute wait time on our drinks, we were more then happy to sit & catch up on the terrace while we enjoyed our refreshments. Well 15 minutes turned to 30, & the 30 minute mark brought a neighboring 6 top table who continually had to keep grandma from putting salt and pepper in her juice. And then 30 minutes turned to 45 and 45 turned to an hour & grandma and the rest of the family got their food & here my mother and I, who together ordered ONE entree, are still empty handed & Nicole has not been seen or heard from. \n\nNicole, it is OKAY that you forgot to put in my order & it's OKAY that the order was messed up. Any mistake that happened is OKAY. What is not okay, is that you neglected to come over & inform us of the situation & let us know that our food would be out shortly & apologize for any inconvenience. \n\nThe burger itself was an overcooked, even burnt, hunk-a hunk-a burnin beef. Yuck! Thank sweet Buddah it's hard to mess up fries. \n\nNext time I'll try my luck elsewhere."

But when the hostess handed me the special vegan/vegetarian menu, I was like a kid in the candy store and couldn't make a decision. Thankfully the BF knows how to take charge as he ordered the Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Dip for our appetizer while buying me another 5 mins to decide on my entr\u00e9e.\n\nThe Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Dip is heaven! Pure savory, creamy, delicious heaven! The cashew cream gives it its creamy texture and awesomeness. Perfect for dipping pita chips. It's dishes like this that make me wonder why the \"normal\" version of this dip needs to contain dairy at all because this dip kicks ass! http://bit.ly/YP3BkI\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I decided to get the Vegan Chick'n and Waffles. Yeah, you heard me right...VEGAN Chick'n and Waffles. They used two pieces of Gardein chick'n breast which was fried crispy. The scallion waffle was savory. You get one large circular waffle cut into quarter pieces. Fluffy on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside. It came with a side of vegan butter. But the real topper of this dish was the spicy maple syrup. YUMMMMM!!! This dish was so good that even the meat eater BF (who ordered the Chipotle Steak Salad) was jealous of my meal and wish he ordered the same thing! http://bit.ly/13BvQFe\n\n$20 for the plate of Vegan Chick'n and Waffles. Yes, it's friggin' expensive but it's friggin' delicious! I believe in having \"Treat Yo' Self\" moments. This is definitely one of them!\n\nI really wish I had room for dessert though. They have a Vegan Banana Split Brownie dish calling out my name!"

Coffee was also delicious.\n\nService wasn't great, but unfortunately, we had a diner in our party that liked to be demanding and rude to waitstaff...so yeah, won't fault ANY restaurant we went to for service because this diner was so high maintenance...The waiter got everyone else's order correct except for mine, which I applaud due to the gazillion customizations made (no bun, no mushrooms, add fruit, no meat, etc etc).\n\nThere are a TON of options at Terrace Pointe Cafe and that is why I'd go back--as Vegas often includes big dining parties, this place is perfect because people can really get whatever they want."

In terms of the hostesses, maybe it's the awful, horribly-fitted pink uniforms they have to wear (I would be miserable if I had to wear that thing too!).

Ironically, the waitress that came profusely apologized (she hadn't seen us sitting in our kind of hidden section of the restaurant) and she was very very friendly the rest of our visit.

My friends dish was bad too, though I can't remember what she got.  We were virtually ignored after we got our food.  The only saving grace was the french onion soup my friend shared with me.   I'm going back to Vegas next week for a wedding and you better believe I won't be eating at the Wynn again!"

Something to note is that they have a dress code (for girls: no sheer tops/bare midriffs, guys need sleeves), but they allow you to sit outside if you're not dressed to their standards. \nWe went with a rather large group and shared a bunch of items so that we would be able to try more things. The service was pretty slow, it took a while for our waitress to show up, and it took an excessively long amount of time for our food to show up. \nSalmon Benedict: special of the day and it was okay. Nothing too special.\nShort Stack Pancakes: very fluffy!\nChicken and Waffles: it's pretty amazing. You gotta cut into all the layers because only the bottom waffle has bacon in the waffle! YUM! It also comes with a spicy syrup, but you can get it on the side if you're not a big fan of spicy.\nCorned Beef Hash: In general I'm not a big fan of corned beef hash, but the boys all loved it. The eggs came out wrong on our order, so we had them recook eggs for us. \nAvocado Bacon Omelet: also nothing special\nI think my favorite thing about this meal had to have been the potatoes. They are freakin' delicious and I just couldn't get enough. They were like chips except crunchy on the outside and still chewy on the inside. I could probably get a side order of those potatoes for myself and just eat that as my meal! I may be a bit bias though because I have a bit of a potato obsession.\nAll in all, even though the service was slow, I would come back again, not only for the potatoes, but because I want to get my hands on some of those red velvet pancakes!"

I was looking to try a different sushi restaurant instead of my usual, \"Ken's\" on Foothill.\n\nThe size is very intimate and the staff were very friendly. Roy always ask if you're allergic to any types of fish and that's very reassuring to know he cares about his customers. It can get busy on the weekends, so it's best to come as early as possible to get a good seat. Patrons are friendly and has the small town feel. \n\nSushi was very very fresh! \n\nService was excellent!\n\nAfter a long late night out of walking up and down the strip with my friend, we were hungry and didn't want to eat too far from the hotel. We wanted to something fast and not overpriced, so we chose the Terrace Pointe Cafe inside the Wynn Casino. \n\nAs with everything else in the Wynn, the Terrace Pointe Cafe was a high end 24/7 Cafe with views of the Wynn Pool Area and has outdoor seating. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nDrinks \n+Orange Juice $6\n+Sprite $4\n\nEntrees\n+12 oz. New York Steak $32\n-fingerling potatoes, herb saut\u00e9ed vegetables, red wine reduction\n\n+Grilled Atlantic Salmon $23\n-creamy corn, potato succotash, grilled asparagus, chili oil\n\nThe food and service 5 stars all the way but the prices hurt our wallets! =/\n\nNext time we'll just head to Denny's to save a few $$ but if you're looking for the Wynn dining experience in the wee hours of the day, than Terrace Pointe Cafe is a great option for you."

The seating was way comfortable and the service was great. Best of all was how affordable it was in the midst of Vegas, haha. I'd say about $15(+/- $3) an entree.  I got the mushroom/swiss burger with shoestring fries. The burger was bigger than my head. And it was topped with an cherry tomato and olive! But most importantly, it was juicy and tasty. Medium rare. Our table also ordered a burger but medium, and it turned out a bit too dry. So stick with medium rare. Two of my friends could not resist ordering the lobster benedict. When it came to our table, my friends had to fight us off from getting to it first! It smelled REALLY good. They licked the plate clean, and probably would've eaten that as well if they weren't so full from the meal on it. Definitely come here for casual food."

We got out there at 9:15, as soon as they opened the outdoor seating (which seems a little late for a breakfast place). \nAnyway, the meal and the staff was fine, and this place was a solid four stars right until as we were finishing up and all the tables we filling, everyone outside was set upon by more and more BIRDS. First pigeons, then grackles, then all sorts of birds. This must be their breakfast buffet, because they were arriving in waves! They got so bold as to land on the table of people eating, and peck at their food! A couple of tables stood up and left.\nSo we paid up and left, seeing as we actually had finished our meal, As a parting gift, the birds pooped on our table twice, and hit a lady sitting across from us on her arm.

The seats at the table had crumbs and hair (bleh!) all over them so we couldn't sit down and had to wait for the hostess to clean it up. \n\nAfter we sat down, absolutely no one came to our table until 12:15 when we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered water for the table and one club soda. She then tells us that our waiter will be right with us to take our order. 12:30 rolls around and still no waiter, but we finally received our drinks! Amazing! BUT no club soda. Had to wait another 10 minutes for it. 12:35 and low and behold we have a waiter!! I've worked in the restaurant business before and you are supposed to greet your customers no longer than a minute after being seated. I think we were very patient (though we thought about getting up to leave) despite the fact that we had to get out of there by 1:30 to catch a flight. We finally placed our order and didn't receive our food till 1:00! How ridiculous! The place wasn't even crowded and I do not know what our waiter was doing. I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but I don't think waiting tables should be on his resume. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE! \n\nI spoke to the manager after we finished eating (in a rush) and she agreed that you should be greeted within 1 minute of sitting down and apologized. She then proceeded to tell me that there was a delay because of the food allergy at our table and they wanted to be extra cautious. I again told her that that wasn't the issue because we couldn't even get someone to take our order for the longest time! Plus the 3 other tables around us had to wait 20-30 minutes for their food after ordering too and I know they didn't have food allergies at their table. Excuses...\n\nShe took off one of our entrees and the drinks (the one club soda) from our bill. I don't think it was worth the time or the money. For the price and time spent, we could have and should have just went across the hall to The Buffet. I expected way more from Wynn. Very disappointing and won't be going back."

And we waited in line for about....2 minutes?\n\nThree people got breakfast entrees while I opted for a lunch sandwich. I got the Smoked Turkey Panini with brie, spinach, bacon aioli on a perfectly toasted sourdough bread. Got my choice with a side of kettle cooked chips. That buttery goodness of that toasted sourdough bread...mmmm mmm!!! Everyone really enjoyed their entrees. Prices are kind of on the expensive side...Our check came out to be over $120+....keep in mind, this is for brunch too. Sooooo.....I guess if you can afford to stay at the Wynn/Encore, then a $100+ check for lunch wouldn't phase you...lol. But you know what? You're on vacation. Live a little. Have fun and eat to your hearts content. Definitely a good choice in casual dining at this place."

I get that I am eating at a fantastic and expensive hotel...but that was annoying considering the sandwich wasn't worth half of the $16.00 it cost me, nor did I request grilled and/or caramelized onions...just raw.\n\nIt is my understanding that breakfast is TPC's forte, and in fairness I did not try any breakfast selection, but I will admit the pancakes and waffles being served to other guests did look very good!\n\nThe service was ok, definitely not up to the Wynn standard, so don't go there expecting much.

We loved watching them drink from the mist sprayers and hop around snootily choosing which gourmet crumbs they like and which aren't to their liking.  \nI guess the one downside of sitting on the terrace was being in the quiet company of so many buttoned-up types.  Our fellow diners were stuffy grumps, sitting silently across from each other and scowling instead of engaging in conversation.  It was like being in a caricature of what rich people are like. \nWe ordered two helpings of the vegan chicken and waffles, two bellinis, and a blackberry tart to share.  The food was to die for.

A 25-30 minute wait outside this cafe is actually a great alternative in comparison.\n\nOverall this is more like 3.5 stars.  The line to get seated was a slow one and could've been handled better.  There were plenty of empty tables, and it almost felt like we were intentionally made to wait outside to create the illusion that the cafe is a really happening place to passersby.  The kind of stuff they do at some not-so-happening SF nightclubs.\n\nThe food itself was quite good.  More like 4.x star quality.  Ambiance was quite pleasant too.  We had the mushroom/truffle burger, a tri-tip sandwich, chicken tenders, and a crab and lobster club.  All high quality and satisfying.  You can tell how a restaurant cares about their food quality by the quality of their sides.  Even the coleslaw was done well enough that one of us who usually doesn't care for coleslaw actually enjoyed it.\n\nI'd recommend this over The Buffet next door."

Each component was bad individually and when eaten in conjunction with one another. I was wishing for a McGriddle as I was downing this thing.

My husband insisted we eat here but I couldn't remember this place.

The cafe has indoor and outdoor seating, if the weather permits, I suggest sitting outside which offers a pretty view of the swimming pool.\n\nThis was my last day in Vegas and I wanted to make sure I spent some 'alone' time with my niece. I met her in the lobby of the Wynn so naturally I suggested the cafe I noticed earlier. We were greeted and seated immediately with a nice view of the pool. The menu had a few tempting (fat laden) items but I was drawn to the veggie omelet. My niece exclaimed \"Chicken and Waffles! Together? For breakfast?\" (she's from the UK). I immediately urged her to 'try something new', in other words I wanted to try the C&W as I've never had them. The waiter took our order and delivered the coffee and juice quickly. \n\nWe enjoyed watching the people in the pool (people are so weird) while waiting for our food which came out piping hot and beautifully displayed. My veggie omelet was delightful, the 'square' of hash browns crispy / tender and the rye toast was very fresh and delicious. The chicken and waffles were a big hit. Bacon bits in the waffle with white meat chicken tenders topped with a fried egg. My niece ordered the spicy syrup and it was the perfect hot / sweet combination. The waffles were airy and crisp, the crust on the chicken was fried to golden perfection. I never thought I would like this combination but was I proven wrong. Hot damn, all of the flavors combine together for a sinfully wonderful treat. \n\nThe check hit the table and holy cow: $60! They nickel and dime you to death in Vegas so think twice about ordering extras (like a side of salsa). Though expensive, I would visit this place again for the C&W."

The chicken was dry and the cabbage and dressing was bad. \n\nThe mushroom chess burger that my friend had looked good. Then again how can you really screw up a burger? This place would only be good if you were drunk out of your mind and you were starving. If you were to come here without these conditions then i don't recommend that you come here.

It was crowded, but this is Wynn.  It's run like a machine.  I'm sure they realize that Saturdays are busier than Tuesdays or Wednesdays, so I would think they would have more employees working on weekends.  But, it took well over 20 minutes to get our food after ordering.  It took nearly 10 minutes just to get drinks.  So, bad start for sure.\n\nMy wife had French toast, which was dry.  Also, despite the plethora of sugary ingredients, it was somehow bland.  We would not repeat this.\n\nSo, how come I gave this place 3 stars?  The chicken and waffles.  It was fantastic.  First of all, it's a large breakfast; I didn't finish it.  Each order contains 2 large thin chicken cutlets fried.  They were very crispy, the chicken remained juicy and it was seasoned well.  It's the kind of chicken I wish I was able to make at home.  Practice I guess.  The chicken went well with the waffles.  It comes with maple syrup and spicy syrup.  I liked both, and both went well with the dish.  \n\nOverall, we would probably return, but during off hours.  The service at Society Caf\u00e9 was better during a busy time.  I will definitely get the chicken and waffles again, but I doubt we get the French toast."

I got runny and translucent eggs. My business associate ordered an omelet that was so spicy, he couldn't eat it. The waitress never asked why he barely touched it. I ordered tomato juice and it was warm, not cold. The hash browns were amazing and delicious, but a very tiny portion, there was toast which was way over-toasted and cold and we had to butter our own. The service was very friendly, but the waitress apparently wasn't listening to what we were saying. An hour after we left, we walked over to another restaurant and had lunch because we were still so hungry. How weird is that?\n\nI complained in an email to the Wynn that I didn't mind paying 50 bucks for a breakfast for 2, because the Venetian has a breakfast house that is one of the best I have ever experienced and it's a bit more expensive. The manager at the Terrace Pointe seemed concerned on what I thought of the experience, but never got back to me as promised and so I have finally decided never to go back to the Terrace Pointe. I have enjoyed the cafe in the lobby at the Wynn but after this experience, I doubt if I will be eating at any Wynn restaurant for a long time to come. Breakfast at the Wynn has become a joke for us now. Maybe their lunch is better? We don't care because there are so many amazing places on the strip to eat, why bother with the Wynn?"

Ordered the burger at medium well but turned out to be well done. \n\nValue: 1, for the food that we ordered, it was totally over-priced. I really expected much greater things for a burger that's $17. (no sides)\n\nThis restaurant is right next to pool at Wynn, but even if the pool is filled with America's Top Models, its food's lameness would not persuade me to come back."

Come to LA and I' ll show you what a berry tart looks like...\nI am in the restaurant business too and I know how servers make $. I left 15% for the first time in my life!!! They didn t even deserve that.. Total disappointment!!!"

We opted for waiting the 5 minutes to miss the breakfast menu (ends at 11am) and get the lunch menu once I saw the kobe beef sliders on the lunch menu :-) \n\nMy husband and I were trying to \"keep it  light\" after gorging at Del Frisco's Steak House for dinner the night before.  Riiight...so we just ordered some apps and split them.    We had the kobe beef sliders - which were amazing.  I think I could eat 3 orders myself.  Then the coconut shrimp and the asian chicken lettuce wraps (nothing like at PF Chang's or Chinoix but good.)\n\nThey also had Bellinis on the menu which instantly makes the place a favorite as they made them right (unlike most places) - almost to Cipriani perfection. \n\nService was great.  The waiter was always there when needed but not obtrusive.\n\nThis is a great place to walk up to after lounging in the sun by the pool.  Cost is..well...its The Wynn so deal with it."

Chicken was excellent, perfect amount of crispiness. Waffle was delicious with a slight crisp accompanied by a soft fluffiness. The spicy syrup the came with was different and went well. Some reviewers are complaining of the price, but for a las vegas hotel I really did not think it was bad...something like $20 bucks.\n\nI also tried the biscuits and gravy, bacon, eggs benedict. Nothing mind blowing about those, but all were really good. I'd also recommend the 21$ all u can drink mimosas, some of which I stole from my dad.\n\nService was great. View was beautiful as we faced the Wynn pool. No complaints at all."

This affordable and casual elegant location is prime for al fresco dining and beautiful people watching, especially since it's on a small terrace facing the main pool. For those afraid of the Las Vegas sun, there are plenty of umbrellas to keep you from getting sun damaged. We all know that it can be challenging at times to find a restaurant in a casino that has a lot of natural lighting in Las Vegas, so this is an excellent option to take for a short break from all of the noisy slot machines and second hand smoke that you encounter while being stuck indoors. \n\nThe main dining room is not pretentious, but very inviting. The terrace is where al fresco fans will be most satisfied. Although the food was quite average for a Wynn caliber hotel, it was good enough to \"hit the spot\", help nurse that hangover and for the health conscious diners. The portions are large like your standard Cheesecake Factory dishes and fulfilling. On top of that, the service was mediocre. Everyone's food averaged over 30 minutes to prepare, while the staff apologized in a robotic tone at least 3 times regarding the delay.   \n\nI'd imagine on any given weekend during lunch many patrons are either already inebriated or recovering from a massive hangover from the night before. I sure was, so my taste buds may have been a little shot during my dining experience. However, I still have to rate the Terrace Pointe Cafe a three, since I expected so much more from the Wynn Hotel's restaurant service and kitchen. Luckily, I was more forgiving and let the outdoor ambiance influence me more than our dining experience."

Eggs Benedict is good, not great as the \"Canadian Bacon\" is more like ham, and dry. They have a couple of other options of Benedict's, but I didn't try them. If you're not in the mood to gorge yourself on way more food than you need at the Wynn Buffet, this is a great, and more scenic option.

I was told that sitting outside would be an additional 20 minutes on top of the thirty that I had already waited.  I was at the bar.  At the bar I was allowed to order drinks but when I asked if I could order food from the bar I was told that I could not because I was not dressed appropriately and could only eat outside. Being told that you can sit in a bar order and pay for drinks but are not allowed to order food is absolutely ridiculous and it honestly made me feel like I was a dog that had to eat outside. We ordered bottom of this mimosas at the bar and then finally about 30 minutes later were brought to our table outside. After ordering her food are bottomless Mimosas were now empty and sat that way for another 20 minutes making the whole point of bottomless mimosas pointless. When we explained our issue to the server when he finally came back with our food he was very apologetic and did his best to try and rectify the situation. At that point after dealing with the rude hostess as well as the bartender there wasn't much I could be fixed at that point.  I'll be the last time I return to the terrace point."

Or, at least what the vegan options are (he happens to be vegan).\n\nOur server didn't know.\n\nNo matter. All of the restaurants at the Wynn have separate vegetarian menus, and that's what we ordered from. I couldn't resist the chicken and waffles and my wife had to go for the famous $9 burger, fries, and shake deal.\n\nWhile we waited, we took in the atmosphere. It was way too hot to eat on the patio, but that seems to be the main attraction.\n\nEven if you're an omnivore like me, I recommend checking out the vegetarian menu. I had never seen vegan \"chick'n\" and waffles before, and other diners near us were fascinated when our orders were brought out. Also, the chicken and waffles were damned good. This is an example of mock meat that could possibly fool someone. The scallion waffles came with regular as well as spicy syrup, and vegan \"butter\" (Earth Balance?) My wife's cheeseburger was a Gardein burger with Daiya cheese, ketchup, mustard, and pickles designed to replicate similar fare from the Golden Arches, and it came pretty close. The only flaw, strangely, was the bun, which didn't quite have the proper look and taste. I still liked it. The fries were probably made without all of the 17 ingredients that go into Mickey D's fries:\n\nhttp://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnutrition/ingredientslist.pdf\n\nThe non-dairy chocolate shake was quite tasty too. All told, not a bad deal for $9. It's worth a try, but I don't know the value offset that of my $20 meal.\n\nThe Wynn probably has better options whether or not you eat meat, but we definitely enjoyed our meals, and we are really glad that they can accommodate special diets, including gluten-free.\n\nThanks, Steve!"

We got 2 free tickets to the buffet, so knowing that we are going for an early lunch, I sought out a place to get a light breakfast for the two of us. First off, one of the security guys walking around the casino, kindly tells me about \"Terrace\" when I inquired about where to get a hot breakfast (it was around 6:45a). Then, as I'm walking around trying to find it, one of the dealers tells me it's not open yet. Huh? So as I'm contemplating leaving Wynn and where to go for light breakfast fare/coffee, I ask another gentleman who was walking by the tables, and he said, \"It SHOULD be open\" and proceeds to walk me over there... and indeed, it was open. Okay! So there is an unmanned bar where I need to place a To Go order, at which point the hostess calls the bar guy to come out. I ordered 2 bagels toasted with butter on the side, 1 coffee, and 1 tomato juice with lime and it comes to $22.17 - yikes! With a small tip, it was about $24. Bagels were just ok, kinda hard actually, but they did put in some little jars of strawberry jam which was nice. Basically, you are at the mercy of whatever is available in these casinos and you pay for the convenience of not having to stumble around outside like a hobo. Looking forward to the lunch buffet and dinner later at Phil's Steakhouse at TI."

I also chose this spot because my good pal, Lilli S. frequents it and always recommends the lobster benedict. \n\nThe lobster benedict was the only thing on my mind when it came to ordering.

Although, I didn't initially enjoy it much (refer to above paragraph), I did enjoy it later for a late night snack. They definitely do not hold back on the lobster. Since I'm a ketchup addict, I doused it with the good ol' Heinz 57 (Guch would disagree).\n\nAcross the way is Wynn's buffet, so if you don't feel like pigging out then Terrace Point Cafe is an available close option.

Not only is the first meal of the day, the meal that sets the tone for the whole day, but it includes everything delicious. Cheese, potatoes, eggs, bacon -- need I say more? I opted to sit outside as it was a nice day out. Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn is nice inside, but the outside was too perfect to pass up. The open air was laden with trees, and had a great view of their pool. Eating breakfast here was just pleasant. The service was great, and the atmosphere was relaxing.\n\nI ordered the the Omelet Trio. It consisted of 2 mini pancakes, hash browns, and an omelet. The interesting part was that the hash brown was the tastiest of the three -- it was the star of the dish. Maybe that's why they placed it in the middle. The omelet was normal, as were the pancakes. These hash browns were special. It was a triangle block, not the traditional diner style ones. I am a big fan of crispy, crunchy hash browns fried in butter. These though were kind of mushy and thick, almost cake like. That didn't matter. They were delicious!\n\nThe french toast ham sandwich was a first for me. Never have I had french toast as the bread of a sandwich. Open faced, all of the ingredients sat on top of the french toast. The sweet and salty aspect of the dish had be wanting more. I am not a fan of the crust on french toast, so I liked that they cut that part off. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham with melted Swiss on top was great together. And of course, this dish came with a side of hash browns too. Score!\n\nNothing beats breakfast outside in Vegas adjacent to the pool at the Wynn. The Wynn in Vegas is beautiful -- Props to Steve Wynn. It might be one of my favorites properties. The design cues are timeless and classy. Sometimes, I feel themed Vegas resorts are so touristy sometimes. Keeping with the design and feel of the Wynn, Terrace Point Cafe fits in perfectly."

Its a great place to go over the pictures on the camera, delete whats needs to be deleted, organize memories, and alibi's if need be and just have a good last couple of laughs over whatever vegas style adventures we've had on that particular visit. \n\nWe usually sit at the bar, have a couple of their excellent bloody mary's (they actually usually the spicy vodka, the only kind that belongs in bloody marys in my opinion) an order of the lobster benedict, and whatever else tickles our fancy on the menu. The lobster benedict is as rich and decadent as it sounds. Its not served on a soggy english muffin, instead its on a perfectly spiced crispy potato croquette, they are not at all stingy with the fresh lobster, and the asparagus is always crispy and perfect. The hollandaise is not to rich or eggy, or to heavily poured on, just enough to bind all the other tastes together. I usually order mine sans bacon (I just like to taste the lobster without all that smoky baconess) and fried eggs over easy instead of poached, because of personal preference. We've also ordered the salad with goat cheese beignets. The beignets are indulgent, crispy crunchy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside, the salad goes well with them as it cuts the richness. They also have a lobster and crab salad that I love; I always ask for rolls when we get it  because its not a green salad, but a mixed salad that is just begging to be eaten on roll drizzled with hot sauce. We've also tried a steak salad, that didnt dissapoint either. I've had the crab cakes here as well, but was not really impressed with them, it was the first time in my life I thought to myself I wish there was less crab in these cakes, they just lacked other flavor, I kept thinking \"I want to take these back to kitchen myself and season them up right\". One miss in a series of hits is not enough to make me say I dont love place, truly I do! \n\nThe service at the bar is always attentive, occasionally we are forced to take a table because of the size of our group or because the bar is full, dont be deterred by the line outside, they are quite efficient at getting people seated and fed, however you will never feel rushed to leave. If you sit outside you will have a view of the Wynn Pool, not the topless one, but I hear the view is still lovely!"

I want!!!\n\nThe Wynn has proven to be among one of the best places in Vegas for vegans to enjoy both fine and casual dining at one of its many restaurants, Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn did not disappoint.  My first recommendation is to request outdoor seating on the patio, how relaxing!  Once seated, request the vegan menu if you're vegan, there are several options for you.  I began my meal with the most amazing appetizer I've had veganized in my life, the spinach artichoke dip - oh how I've missed this dip!  I would say that the dip alone is worth 5 stars and had I known how amazing it was I would have ordered two (and...um...possibly three...it's OK to be a little piggy on vacation, right???) in lieu of an entree.  Then came my much anticipated vegan burger, fries, and milkshake.  I think I mostly enjoyed the novelty of it more than anything, I mean it's pretty rare to get a vegan burger, fries, AND a milkshake anywhere - it even came in a box reminiscent of a fast-food meal.  But overall, I felt the burger was a little boring, it wouldn't hurt if they updated it as I'm sure one of their fancy-pants chefs could come up with something unique/interesting.  The milkshake was made with coconut milk and would have been better off having been made with soy or almond milk as the coconut flavor was overpowering.  So as far as the burger and fries, I don't regret ordering the entree as I enjoyed the novelty of it, however I wouldn't order it again unless they update the burger.  Overall we had a great time, great atmosphere, and pretty fantastic spinach and artichoke dip!"

The wait was only about 15 minutes; we were seated, given menus, and waited about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come over.  \n\nOnce she did she was very pleasant, and got our orders in promptly.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was advertised as coming with a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Maybe because I got the cup instead of the bowl, it didn't come with one.  The soup was WAY too sweet, but otherwise had good texture, and a nice background kick.  \n\nMy entree was sorely disappointing.  I got the carne asada, which was pieces of skirt steak wrapped in corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro.  It came with a tomato rice, a tortilla bowl filled with pinto beans and melted cheese, and a little side of salsa.  It was all just so...bla.  Nothing about it was bad; it just wasn't that good.  The tomato rice was probably the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The portion was also way too large.\n\nMy dessert was the best part of the meal.  I got the cheesecake sampler, which came with three mini cheescakes on a plate- one plain with 2 fresh blackberries on top, one mango with fresh mango chunks on top, and the other chocolate with a truffle.  The mango was the best out of the three, although the plain was a close second, with a true New York cheesecake flavor and nice graham cracker crust.  My cafe latte was  large and very hot, which is nice since they can often be lukewarm.\n\nThe service from start to finish was super sloooow.  It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch, and we are not slow eaters.  And considering that the delicious Wynn buffet was only $30 for the champagne brunch that day, the $45 + tip that I paid for this mediocre meal was really painful.\n\nThe one high point of the experience was the decor and ambiance of the place.  Like the rest of the Wynn, it is fresh, bright, and quirky.  I loved the white plates with sunny yellow borders, the oversized yellow coffee cups, the denim-looking napkins, and the lime green couch with navy border at the entrance.

I sure hope they replace the cream. \n\nBasically, there were things I really liked and really disliked about this place.\nThe good: location, ambience, service\nThe bad: most of the food, the birds"

Fiance got the lobster benedict which is a heart attack on a plate, perfect! I had the vegetable omelette and eggs benedict on another occasion, I did like the benedict more than the omelette only because the vegetable weren't mixed in and the flavors weren't melded. \n\nThe coffee here is high quality. i did get a coconut shake here which I read on someone else's review as being really good and I thought it was good, but nothing to write about. \n\nTip: ask for free biscuits! there are a maple glaze and fresh out of the oven yum !!!\n\noutside seating if you can is a must because it overlooks pool area and its very fun to people watch."

Too bad the food beverage and service are really lame. They try to hard with the food. The cobb salad and club sandwich have been pretty good for the past century - I don't know why they had to change it up? And the service is Very slow and disinterested. And... It's not cheap.  Did I mention the patio is nice?"

            "review": "We had a very bad experience at Terrace Pointe Caf\u00e9 during breakfast. Grackle birds were constantly dive bombing customers and the food! The staff seemed to just be used to working around them and ignoring them. Two girls sitting near us asked to be moved inside after one flew down, sat on the back of my chair, and began chirping loudly. Another guy took several pics on his phone of four birds picking at the dishes of a vacated table next to him. My husband was salting his newly arrived omelet when a grackle swooped in and took a bite off his plate! DISGUSTING. The staff didn't seem to notice. At first, my husband decided to just let it go - he cut away the half of the omelet that the bird had attacked and put it on my coffee saucer, then continued his meal. The bird later returned for food and knocked the saucer off the table, shattering it. It was then that we got up to complain. \n\nWe received a half-hearted apology from the manager and my husband's plate was taken off our bill. The manager seemed indifferent to the situation, saying that grackles are a protected species in Nevada and the hotel is working on an environmental solution, whatever that means. I would suggest that the Wynn hire a full-time bird minder in the meantime. \n\nI do not understand how this is not a health code violation. Other reviews list this as an ongoing issue dating as far back as 2010. It was disgusting and completely unacceptable to see dozens of birds hopping around on serving trays, digging under napkins into abandoned bread baskets, and generally just being nuisances to all of us tryjng to enjoy our $21 breakfast plates and get out as soon as possible."

I have been dining here during the Summer months for years, and sometimes during the not so warm months if I am at Wynn for an event or a show. The Cafe sits overlooking the Wynn pool and is a nice view when the weather is warm ;)\n\n Here is the thing..it's a cafe. Simple, but elegant in it's styling. Used to be 24 hours, but now only into late night I believe. I have always been a fan. You can get everything from a burger and fries to a Vegetarian menu option of a burger and fries. I have had their 'veggie burger' and fries served with a cashew milk-chocolate shake and really enjoyed it. \n\nit's comfortable, and clean, and the food is made well and tastes good. Sure it's not your most typically priced 24 hour, but you are on a 5 star property and the food is comparable to the price point. That being said, it's usually about $40 each when I have dined at Terrace Point, but we have a few drinks, appetizers, dinner.. it's all good and not too much more than I would spend at any other cafe around Vegas. \n\nTh atmosphere is relaxed with comfortable seating and they have good food and a full bar. For that I'm In! Check it out!"

            "review": "Located just past the Wynn Buffet, the Terrace Pointe Cafe offers up a modern take on classic American dishes. With entrees in the $10-25 range, it's a welcome alternative to higher priced dining options but still manages to keep some of the upscale charm that you'd expect from the Wynn brand.\n\nYou'll be given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating upon arrival. The outdoor seating overlooks the beautifully laid out Wynn pools. There's a lengthier wait time for outdoor seating, but you'll enjoy the laid back vibe of the pool scene. You'll take advantage of the shade of the patio umbrellas -- so as to not toast yourself under the bright Vegas sun -- while sipping on a mid-day pitcher of sangria.\n\nThe, usually immediate, indoor seating isn't a total wash, you'll still be able to most likely enjoy the pool scene through the floor to ceiling windows; that is, if you're able to successfully fight off the rest of your party to grab the pool-facing seats.\n\nAs you'd expect, the service is top-notch. When a nearby diner asked their server if they knew if there was going to be a UFC fight that particular weekend, she quickly excused herself and informed the hostess of the inquiry. The hostess walked over to their table two minutes later and was able to confirm the details of the match up that weekend, which she gathered from a quick call to the concierge desk.\n \nGood food, a great view, and service that is willing to go the extra mile for their guests -- always a five star experience in my book."

As a \"party of one\" the hostess suggested I might be most comfortable sitting at the bar, presumably because there was a wait for two-tops. I was in a hurry so I said ok. \n\nI wanted a Benedict but the only two on the menu were a lobster version and one with pulled pork, so I passed. I ended up ordering a bagel and cream cheese and a Greek yogurt with berries and granola. \n\nFirst there was some confusion among the bartenders about the bagel, which I wouldn't have known if they hadn't each asked me if the other was getting my bagel. Then when it came it was burned. It would have been crappy even if it weren't blackened - is this bagel seriously the best available in Las Vegas?  It has to be, right, because if there were a better bagel I would think Mr. Wynn would have found it, right?  The saving grace was the cream cheese, which was definitely not from a tub. \n\nThe yogurt with berries and granola was better but it was way too big, probably to justify the $14 price. Seriously, y'all?  For yogurt and a couple dozen berries?  It had blueberries, blackberries and strawberries over some bland yogurt - I asked for vanilla but I think I got plain.  The star of this dish was some seriously amazing granola, which I'm told they roast fresh every day. \n\nHigh prices but with some nice elements and a pretty setting.  I'd go back."

Our waitress Heather was terrible, and the guy who took our drink order was nice at first but then totally ignored us.  Not only did we have to ask multiple times for bread, but we didn't get drink refills, and it took a LONG time to place our order and get our food.  The food took so long to come out that everything was lukewarm.  We would have sent it back, but we were starving by the time it finally showed up.  The craptastic service was made even worse by the fact that she was giving excellent service to a table of old white people behind us.  Mmm, brunch with a side of racism.  My favorite.  The bf was steaming mad by the time we got our check, and we only ended up tipping $1, on a check that was over $30 (speaking of which, the entrees are really expensive for what they are -- my turkey burger was $15!).\n\nAs for the food, the bf had the breakfast plate which came with pancakes and eggs and sausage links.

The bleu cheese wasn't as pungent and salty as the kinds that go in my salads, so that was a good thing.

Since Steve Wynn (as rumor has it) is vegan, they know how to do vegan food well. We had the tempeh \"tuna\" melt sandwich, which looked and tasted very convincing; it was delicious. But, the best was the Wynn vegan burger which comes with fries and a vegan chocolate shake (made with coconut milk), all for only $11-best vegan meal deal in town! The burger was one of (if not THE) best vegan burgers I've ever tasted. It came with the usual pickles, mustard, ketchup, and American cheese (which is also vegan, I double checked since it's what I do).  It looks like a fast food happy meal but it's vegan and much healthier. Plus, we sat in their outdoor seating overlooking the awesome pool. The service was fantastic, as has been my experience in Vegas overall."

Let's just remember this place is considered \"cheap\" for Wynn standards.\n\nThe food is great.  Portions are large and the presentation often makes patrons forget they're eating at a diner.  I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with great experiences each time.  The service was stellar and was as classy as the food.\n\nThough the decor is a tad on the cheesy side, the awesome views of the pools near the windows make up for it during the day time.  I have not ever had a bill for less than $100 here, and that is dining with 3-4 people at a time.  It's more than likely during my next extended stay at the Wynn will result in another visit to this lovely cafe."

Not at all what I wanted or expected.  The pork belly Benedict was horrible.  I literally checked if there was blood in my mouth because it tasted so metallic and just like blood.  So gross.  The traditional Benedict was better but I can make it better myself at home.  The crab was the best one and it wasn't even that great.  The crabcake was soggy.  The hollandaise had no flavor.  The egg wasn't even poached correctly.  Just not great at all.  \n\nMy husband got the LEO which is lox, eggs scrambled and a bagel with dill cream cheese.  Think he was expecting the traditional locks with a bagel and capers and onions as it stated on the menu but this came like a sandwich with the egg and everything on the bagel.  He also ordered a blueberry muffin and he said that was the best part.  Just eh, not worth the money."

No good!!\n\nBut on the good side, the d\u00e9cor of this place is quite soothing with a view of their outside pool and if you prefer to eat outside you can.\n\nNow let's get to the food. If I can RECOMMEND anything, I would suggest the VEGAN CHICK'N and WAFFLES|$20. The added spiced maple syrup and scallions inside the waffle batter...sets them apart from any old chicken and waffle.\n\nWe also order the following...\n\nVEGAN PAIN DE MIE FRENCH TOAST|$15...Holy heck why can't all restaurants serve this. They dip the toast in a banana soy milk, top with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar. It's like breakfast dessert, yuumm!!! I want it now. If you prefer sweet or savory breakfast order this!!\n\nSide Order-Breakfast Potatoes|$4 and Gardein Breakfast Sausage|$4...I would suggest you pass on these sides. The potatoes were soggy rather than crispy. The sausage was good, nothing spectacular\n\nDessert-Organic Vegan Blackberry Tart|$8...was not a huge fan of this dessert, I'm not a huge fan of eating desserts that have seeds.\n\nThis was definitely the way to end our last morning in Vegas.

I was in Vegas for work, every moment of my down time was spent at the Wynn property and I cannot say enough great things about my overall experience at this hotel - the room was beautiful and the casino is very well organized and great.  With that being said, the experience I had at this cafe this morning will likely result in me never giving Wynn another dime.  I gambled all night on Tuesday 3/8/16 @ the Wynn and as a result the casino host comped me and my business partner our breakfast at the terrace point cafe.  As soon as I walked in I found myself waiting in line to be seated in a pretty much empty establishment, literally waited patiently for 5 minutes for whatever reason is unknown to me.  Upon seating, it took at least 10 minutes to get our beverages, my water was never topped off.  Numerous employees walked by my empty water several times.  At one point I got up out of my seat and walked over to the bar to get my water refilled myself, the bartender proceeded to key punch something in the computer and didn't even look up at me or greet me even though I was hovering and in obvious need of assistance.  When I finally interjected, he didn't even let me say what I needed and told me that he'll \"be right back\" with an annoyed tone.  The food was just mediocre, nothing special.  The steak I had with my eggs was extremely fatty for a strip and was very thin, the biscuits and gravy are an outright abomination. Given the fact that this eatery is located on the Wynn property, I figured it would be paired with a \"Wynn\" level of service, I was wrong.  It's a shame that this experience is going to lead to me having to find a new favorite casino/hotel when I venture to Vegas in the future, get it together!"

This is the kind of dessert that  could end relationships if someone takes more than their share; but fortunately, the BF knows his place.   \n\nService was a little slow, but otherwise a lovely experience.   The Wynn organization continues to impress me with their vegan options, and I will continue to pay way too much money for brunch when the food is this good."

My stack of blueberry pancakes arrived with the server smiling--the stack was about five inches thick. I passed about 1/3 of the stack to my companion who, fortunately, was hungry even after his own bacon-egg-hash brown-toast plate. I also had a plate of bacon - quality.\n\nRoom service prices at the Wynn are pretty insane so on another day of my stay, I had lunch at the Terrace Point Cafe solo. The quantity options were pretty overwhelming so I ended up over-ordering. For an appetizer, I had pork pot stickers which I greatly enjoyed. My main was tomato bisque with \"mini\" grilled cheese. There was nothing mini about it though--instead the chef had cut a tradiitional sandwich into quarters. Tasty if not groundbreaking."

For starters I strongly recommend the $20/glass bottomless mimosas that are refilled frequently.  This isn't a huge menu but it has all you need for a great lunch or brunch with variety for half sandwiches and soups or salads.  I had the tuna sandwich that was just the right size and a generous bowl of fresh fruit.  As an appetizer we shared the chips with guacamole and salsa along with the tuna poke all were more than satisfying.  One thing I love about all Wynn properties are the vegan options that my brunch mates enjoyed and I did as well for a vegan banana split.  \n\nI would recommend waiting for outdoor seating on a nice day and the service is great as expected without anyone trying to rush you off as you enjoy your food and the weather/view."

The indoor dining room requires that guys have sleeves, if you don't, they will just sit you outside under one of the giant umbrellas on the patio. \n\nThere were 5 of us and we ordered various delicious breakfast/ brunch things like the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, Omelet with truffle, pancakes and the favorite, Steak and Eggs. My portion of (original) Eggs Benedict was so large, I was able to take some back to my room to enjoy later. Our waitress was really friendly and made great suggestions if we were in between choices. Overall, our brunch was pretty quiet because we were so busy chomping on our delicious meal. Needless to say, we all left feeling pretty satisfied!

I thoroughly enjoyed my spaghetti bolognase at 11:00am on a Sunday morning, so I give them props for that.

With the Vegan brunch at Terrace Pointe, one only needs to try it once to know it's the most fabulous brunch you'll find in Vegas.\n\nWe wanted to splurge for a final meal in Vegas, and why wouldn't it be at Uncle Steve's Vegan-friendly paradise of The Wynn?\n\nSure $20 for Chicken and Waffles ain't no joke. Especially considering we have the best version of this back home in The East Bay Area at Hella Vegan Eats and Timeless Coffee, for much less. Thankfully they're not serving up tiny foo foo portions here. No, this is definite hangover food in size and taste. So much so that this was the only place in town that we needed a to go bag. The waffle was fantastic and I wish I knew how they got the coating so perfectly on the huge slab of Gardein. \n\nThe Strawberry French Toast was a bit cheaper, yet still pricey. This was my honey's order, yet I ended up eating more of it than she did. I'm usually more of a savory vs sweet breakfast eater, but if you are going the sweet route, you can't go wrong with this dish. The french toast was perfectly made in the \"I can't believe it's Vegan\" way. So light 'n fluffy, you would never know unless someone told you.\n\nThe reason my honey didn't have room for all of her French Toast was the Blackberry Tart. We ordered that since we knew we wouldn't be eating anywhere else that day. Not bad, as these Wynn folks know their pastries pretty well. \n\nThe homefries we got on the side were so so. They could've used more crisp to 'em. What I would not order is the side of Gardein sausage. Nothing special about it. In fact the two entrees were such good portions that this was overkill. Sure there are a few healthy Vegan entrees on the menu but you're not here for that. Just get the French Toast, Chicken, And Waffles, It's all you need to begin your day. \n\nThe carafe of coffee that the friendly waitress left at the table was a nice old school diner touch that I was not expecting from such a $$$ place. Their uniforms were also very old school and ill fitting. I'm not expecting cocktail waitress apparel, but c'mon Uncle Steve, help these ladies out here!\n\nSure, I could knock them on price. But you know what, it's Vegas. You don't come here because you're looking to save a few pennies. I would come here all over again, as it was probably my favorite meal in town. Especially ever since the closing of Pura Vida. Brunch is the most important meal of the day other than maybe beer. Then again, you need some food to soak up that booze and I can't think of anywhere else I would rather start my day, other than Terrace Pointe Cafe.\n\nThis HOT Stuff Spoiled me with a huge brunch spread: http://www.yelp.com/biz/terrace-pointe-cafe-las-vegas-7?hrid=3WpHWwLGGF17WZx9emijNA"

Still a bit expensive, like everything at the Wynn, but we enjoyed everything we ate, the portions were large, and it's open 24 hours. \n\nFood (4 stars):\n\nI was a bit leery of the Teriyaki chicken sandwich--I mean don't all those \"teriyaki\" sandwiches taste pretty much the same? But this one was good! The chicken was tender, the sauce wasn't sickly sweet or overpowering, and the bun was hearty. It was a good sandwich. I usually only eat half a sandwich when they are big, but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. And it came with onion rings. Yea!\n\nOther things we tried: \n\nSpaghetti bolognese with garlic bread was really heavy on the meat but tasty. Salad (mixed greens or something simple like that) came with a flavorful vinaigrette. Grilled veggie pita with couscous was really good. Manhattan clam chowder was pretty good but a little salty. A cup was just enough. And the coffee was good.\n\nService (1 star):\n\nI just have to say that the service we experienced in Las Vegas was pretty much across the board bad (or on the bad side of the spectrum). I thought Las Vegas was supposed to be a service-oriented town, but it's the worst service I've ever experienced. And I'm a pretty patient and undemanding person when it comes to service. \n\nThe times we went to the Terrace Pointe Cafe, service was slooow (even when not busy; slooooower when it was), the waiters would disappear after serving your food and you couldn't even spy one across the room to wave them down for a bit of ketchup or your bill. Personality-wise the waiters we got were courteous but either overworked/indifferent or somewhat snooty.\n\nMy advice: 1) Be prepared in advance for anything you might possibly need for your meal and ask for it all at once. 2) Keep an eye out for your waiter and when you are close to 3/4 done with your meal, flag him down for your check and any take-home boxes you might need even if you plan to stay a bit longer over dessert and coffee. \n\nLaugh now, thank me later..."

Hotels offer buffet to make loads of profits even if you think you have cleaned out that tray of whatever Alaskan or Antarctican crab legs. Fact is they bought it by the ton and it's dirt cheap for them to prepare. \n\n\n\nAs we moved by the pathetic line that crowd the buffet restaurant at Wynn, we laughed and 2 minutes later we stumbled upon Terrace Pointe Caf\u00e9. It was quite empty and the atmosphere was spot on. Plus no stupid family with kids running around with ice-cream cones. \n\nWe had a booth that was lined in red vinyl. A caf\u00e9 setting that sets itself apart from what we have been to before. It surpasses the rather old-tasteless bling bling Bellagio cafe with a darker and more sinister tone. But we like! It's a caf\u00e9 where couples have done sinful things and taking a break for a quick bite. It's a caf\u00e9 where I can imagine Trent Reznor or Marilyn Manson would dine.  It's a caf\u00e9 where if you have kids running and screaming, the servers might cage them and cook them into  sinister yet delicious soups. \n\nWhat seems like an overpriced $16 smoked burger and $16 clam pasta turned out to be very good. Service was a tad bit slow but both dishes were made with care. The prices are on par to Houstons.\n\nWe ate like champions for under $35."

But my visit with a friend a while back showed was filled with some good and great eats. The best of what I sampled was a brioche French toast retaining much of its batter to give it a cake-like texture and coated with Cap'n Crunch cereal to provide a crispy exterior. Topped off with a banana that was perfectly caramelized and bits of toffee and buttered pecans to counterbalance the soft bread, it all combined to make an excellent rendition of this breakfast staple.\n\nThe red velvet pancakes were another hit. Between each layer of the short stack of rich, cakey, and dense pancakes were layers of a vanilla cream glaze that make this the ultimate treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. If you want something more savory, try the Maine lobster benedict. I appreciated the light application of hollandaise -- just enough, with the perfect egg to butter ratio making it creamy and velvety. Bits of bacon dotted the interior of the light, crispy waffle and was topped with small chunks of lobster firm in texture. Another waffle dish -- the crispy fried chicken and waffles -- had similar crispy edged waffles and chicken with a crispy and crunchy exterior, if somewhat bland. It may not have been the best dish of the morning, but was good enough to satisfy.\n\nYou may be paying a premium because of the location, but the quality far exceeded my expectations. Wait times can be long during peak hours so its best to come before or after the rush. They also have patio seating overlooking their pool."

Upscale breakfast for those who disdain the buffet. I had the avocado, bacon and cheese omelet it was enough to sustain me for a few hours. My wife had waffles and fruit, light and tasty. They put a pot of coffee on your table and this being Vegas you probably need it all and don't have to wait for server refills. Also you can float a boat in the cup they give you."

The cheese was melted perfectly on top and was deliciously savory but did not make up for the pile of mush beneath it.\n\nThe eggs benedict was pretty good, but it certainly wasn't the best we had tasted.  They were trying to be creative by serving a mini waffle under the poached egg insted of an English muffin, but the mini waffle did not have a good bite to it like an English muffin would have thus there wasn't a great contrast of texture with the egg.  \n\nThe lobster was cut into small pieces and sprinkled around the plate.  There was also bacon cut into small pieces too and sprinkled around the plate.  The saltiness of the bacon and the lobster surprisingly went well together and did not clash.  I wonder if it would have been better without the bacon, as the lobster flavor would really sand out.  Perhaps, adding some sliced avocado in place of bacon might be a good flavor pairing although typical.  \n\nThe waffles were crispy and yum. We asked if we could have both the whip cream and butter on the side, but they brought it with the whip cream on top and the butter on the side...it's like...HELLO...what part of BOTH do you not get?\n\nAnyway, our waitress was attentive and the hostesses were very nice.  Although I might have preferred going to the buffet for breakfast for around the same price as my eggs benedict!!!  \n\nBut the line is 2-3x longer!!  In Vegas, if you're NOT a VIP, be prepared to wait in line!"

However I had won 8 dollars after most of the night battling slot machines and alcoholism all up and down the strip and felt like treating myself to a nice breakfast, instead of my usual casino floor free coffee and menthol cigarettes.  Although immediately after sitting down I felt underdressed, even though this is the casual restaurant on the property.  When I saw the size, material, and absolute whiteness of the napkin (serviette?) I realized just how out of place I was.  Oh well, \"Chicken and Waffles my good sir!\"\nI think I also ordered a smoothie that wasn't very good and way expensive.  The chicken and waffles were excellent even though not made in the gut bomb super greasy diner style that I am used to (They had some fancy sweet sauce type stuff for it).  Good portion size and presented in a very loving way that only corporate luxury can deliver.\nThe restaurant faces the pool and has outdoor seating (in the summer in LV, are you crazy?!?) so it has some good people watching opportunities.\nNot high on my list of places to return to, given that if I am in Wynn ever again it will be because I am actually a baller instead of what I was last time which was lost, drunk, and just a tad curious."

But, we decided to try it anyway and sit outside next to the pool (close to the pool) since it was a nice day out. First off, the line was ridiculous, I'd say over 15 minutes, when clearly there were empty tables all around the restaurant. Grand Lux- 0-1 minute wait. We sat outside and the patio was a nice setting. However, the umbrellas which provided the shade had a lot of bird poop and although we wouldn't have minded the cute small birds, there were these hideous pigeons that were also flying around. But the main thing was the smoking. Apparently there was this couple sitting at an adjacent table smoking next to us. We had three small children. We asked if we could move. The hostess informed us that the entire outdoor patio allowed for smoking and if we didn't want to be around smokers that they could find us a table indoors. I was disappointed to know that they didn't even have a smoking section and a non-smoking section for the outdoor patio, which apparently they need because some people in the world have no regard, respect, or consideration, even for kids. If you want to kill yourself, don't kill other people while doing it. Smoking is a sick disease and smokers are addicts and are just compelled to behave in such a destructive way, its pathetic. Why would someone want to smoke a cig for breakfast is beyond me. You'd figure people at a high class place like the Wynn would be different. Guess not. This one is on Wynn for making the rules. Apparently rules are made for those who just don't know better. Since there are no rules here, we won't be returning. The service was good and the food was ok. Its not that hard to mess up scrambled eggs and toast or even chicken and waffles. Not gonna jeopardize my health or my kids because of some idiots and especially because a top hotel doesn't have rules to control their patron's behavior. There are better places to eat, e.g. at the Palazzo or the food court at the Fashion Show, or Chinatown up the street."

While it may seem like a nice idea to actually have breakfast on the outdoor terrace in the nice weather and overlooking the Wynn pool, I would strongly recommend against it on account of a serious problem the outdoor portion of the restaurant has with birds, specifically the fairly aggressive--and hungry--great-tailed grackles.  The grackles will perch themselves on top of the umbrellas and then come down any opportunity they get to pick at leftovers or stacks of cleared plates.  It is pretty unappetizing to watch as five of these birds fly down to the table next to you and pick at whatever they can get.  After I requested to be moved inside, they turned on the mist machines, which seemed to help temporarily but, sure enough, the birds returned undeterred.  And if you must dine outside, by no means leave your table temporarily unattended.  Get one of the waitstaff to watch over your food if you have to, or else you may return to find your food having been picked at by these rats with wings.\n\nThat all said, once I moved indoors, breakfast was okay.  The Croissant was decent and very fluffy, though not particularly fresh.  These are the same croissants they serve for breakfast in packages throughout the hotel.  The Eggs Benedict Trio was decent: a standard Eggs Benedict, together with a lobster version served on a quarter Belgian waffle and a pork one on a pepper-jack biscuit with Jalapeno hollandaise.  The pork one was probably the best of the trio."

I also had an amazing soy latte. My sister ordered the regular french toast which was rolled in cereal and topped with candied pecans and a grilled banana. She said it tasted amazing! The waitress even asked if I had any food allergies. I explained that my vegan lifestyle was based on compassion vs allergies but was still so thrilled that she asked. My sister did not give the question much thought but when her food came with an unexpected slice of strawberry on the top (to which she is VERY allergic) they took the plate away immediately and made her a fresh batch strawberry free. We were just blown away by how helpful and accommodating they were to both of us. We also got to watch birds out by their pool/garden. It was peaceful and beautiful. We both asked for to-go containers and she brought me more vegan butter and syrup to take with me. Awesome! The next time I visit with my husband I plan to try more of their restaurants!

We stayed at the Wynn for the first time, and on both Saturday and Sunday, we visited this place to have a solid meal, the ability to watch the Olympics on TV, in air conditioning, and without having to wait in the extensive line for a table.  The terrace part of the restaurant looked nice, but to be honest, at 11am on a Vegas sunny day, this really didn't appeal to me.  We were given the bar option, since a table would mean we'd have to wait for about 20 minutes.  After sitting down, we both ordered the sangrias from Peggy the bartender, and put in orders for strawberry pancakes (Greg) and Bacon Avocado Omelette (me).  The drinks came up pretty quick, and when the food arrived it looked heavenly.  Bacon, avocado, and eggs are my favorite combo in an omelette, and when I cut into it, the whole thing was spilling out bacon bits (held off on the cheese that comes with it).  The whole thing was completely delicious and I had just enough room to sample some of Greg's pancakes.  As someone who typically avoids heavy breakfast, I would consider ordering this next time.  Those pancakes were outstanding and even baked in the strawberries rather than using it as a garnish.  The second day we came here, we had lunch since breakfast was over.  Greg had the BBQ Bacon Burger and I had the lunch combo with the Asian Chicken Salad, BLT, and a side of potato chips.  Out all of the items, I thought the salad was the best.  The BLT was the perfect combo size, and I really didn't need the chips but it was nice to have the option.  I opted for a mimosa and Greg had a mojito.  Again, another solid meal at Terrace Pointe.  Greg and I are expecting to try and come back and stay at the Wynn, and we'll definitely be stopping back in to Terrance Pointe!"

Our non-vegan waiter confided that this dish was his favorite. I was so excited about all the vegan brunch items but when I heard that, I just had to get it. No lie...it tasted like the real deal, maybe even better!\n\nI also got to have my fancy schmancy Jasmine tea so I was super happy when we were here. Breakfast was pretty pricey, especially considering my bf had the Maine lobster Benedict and unlimited mimosas but he quickly won back the money when we walked over to a roulette table afterwards. It was a fantastic start to our day. The Wynn is a winner!"

They were one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the Wynn, which may seem surprising considering the Wynn offers endless options in the way of 5-star dining. But I'm not a 5-star dining kinda girl. I loved Terrace Point's poolside deck, friendly service, and fresh, delicious food options.\n\nIf I could have had my way with Terrace Point's menu, I would have. But I was trying not to cheat on my low-carb diet TOO much, so I opted for the dungeness crab benedict. It tasted better than it sounds. Amaze! Their homemade English muffin was topped with finely shredded potato, giant chunks of crab and topped with swiss cheese and hollandaise. I was in heaven.\n\nI even cheated a little and got an apple walnut muffin, which was so gigantic I took it home on the plane with me.  My husband was so excited that they had fried chicken and waffles. They even have a spicy maple syrup for it, if you're feeling adventurous :) \n\nAnd our server was kind enough to speed up service so that we could catch our flight, although I was so sad to leave. If only I had time to spare, I would have sipped my iced tea on the poolside deck for hours. But sadly, I had a flight to catch. Next time, Terrace Pointe!"

My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast/brunch while in Vegas and were appalled at the terrible service, mediocre food, and relatively high prices.  \n\nThe place wasn't terribly busy, but it took forever to get menus, forever to place our order, forever to get our food, and then forever to get the check (we actually never did get the check - we ended up just leaving enough money on the table).    \n\nThe waitress was rude, and acted like our requests for bread were unreasonable.  I realize its not her fault that it took close to an hour for the food to come out, but its also not crazy of us for wanting multiple bread baskets while we wait.   We were by far the youngest people in the place (we're in our early 20s...actually I guess I should say \"mid-20s\"...yikes!), were dressed fairly casually, and ordered relatively cheap things, and she gave us the distinct impression that we were too poor for her classy, classy establishment.    We stiffed her - one of the few times in my life I've ever done that, but the service was beyond terrible.\n\nThe food was not terrible, but not particularly good either.  I had a Belgian waffle and my boyfriend had some kind of burger.  They were both edible but completely unmemorable.   Also, thanks to the atrocious service they were cold by the time they reached us.\n\nThere are so many other wonderful restaurants in Vegas -- go elsewhere!"

The service was impeccable and my good buddy who was celebrating his birthday had made it a annual bday brunch spot for the last couple of years. He highly recommended the lobster benedict saying it had blown his mind the first time. I don't take his recommendations lightly either, he has a refined taste pallet hah.\n\nWe literally had half our party order lobster benedict expecting the world because it sure as hell sounded great. Upon receiving my dish I was starved and surely thought anything that tasted semi decent would satisfy me. Boy was I wrong. The egg was COOKED through and the yoke did not break and ooze out as a proper benedict should. The piece of bacon served on top and I quote from a friend tasted like \"ASS\". This is bacon we are talking about, how hard is it to mess up bacon!? Instead of a typical english muffin or some sort of bread the benedict was served on hash browns and the textures did not blend well at all. I could go on and on about how the dish conceptually and flavor wise went wrong. Bottom line it was a big FAIL. \n\nWe asked if the chef changed recently and the waiter confirmed that there was a change in the chef. Bring back the talent please. \n\nThe ambiance and service was great, but if you can't get the food right you could have ambiance and service for days and it won't matter at all."

We had 8 people at our table but still, any other restaurant can bring our foods out faster especially when our food can easily be made. My latte was the only one that came out super late while everyone else got their coffee. Usually I like to drink my latte before I eat that way I can just chill, talk to my girlfriends, and drink my latte. Instead, my friend had to flag down the waitress and tell her I waited 25 minutes for my latte and she gave me a bullshit excuse saying there must be a line cause there's only one machine. Right.... No body is here girl. Also, the waiters got most of our orders mixed up and not the way we wanted our food to be cooked. For example, my friends wanted scrambled eggs instead they got over easy.

It really is a nice way to get your day started and a nice option if you aren't feeling like gorging yourself at a buffet.\n\nI had the Wynn Burger and it was good partially due to the fact I was craving a burger. Nothing too fancy but it also didn't disappoint. \n\nA quick tip in case you're coming wanting breakfast options but instead happen to stroll in well into brunch time is that you can ask your waiter to provide a breakfast menu and they're pretty good about making what you want. It was nice because I went in thinking \"pancakes\" but my stomach and the inner-dude in me said \"get the burger.\" Though I must say the pancakes did look tasty from watching the people sitting next to us enjoying various breakfast items.\n\nIn the end, this place gets the job done and is a good affordable (most items are in the $10-20 range)choice as a breakfast or lunch option where you can sit on the terrace overlooking the pool. As for later in the day, I'd opt for Zooza Crackers just because it's situated in the center of all the hustle and bustle and it's fun to people watch from their open booths. Also a great late night option for food."

The sandwich had big chunks of meat with a light mayo sauce mixture. The one thing I didn't like about the sandwich though was the extra third bread they added. (To much bread) I tried my friend's steak salad to which everything came fresh and the steak being tender and seared to a pink finish. I also tried the spaghetti bolognese. Thinking it would just taste like any bolognese, I was surprised to how different it was and it was pretty damn good as well. And they didn't overcook the pasta.

Terrace Pointe is Wynn's counterpart (table service, higher end) minus all that Iron Chef hype. What I like most is the outdoor dining patio overlooking the Wynn pool. The dining room is very spacious with high ceiling and a full bar. They do have a strict dress code IN THE DINING ROOM: no tank top for men (which I brazenly perpetrated on an 115F day) and no sheer cover-up for ladies. I care less because I come for the patio.\n\nWe made two visits this 4th of July weekend for breakfast; both service and food were distinctive. Like I mentioned in my review of Peppermill Lounge, prices are steep in Vegas unlike you do the food court plastic tray thing. Terrace Pointe is actually very reasonable consider you can very good service in a fine decor.\n\n*Oatmeal ($14): with sliced banana, raspberries, blackberries, walnuts, raisins all in separate mini cups. The perfect healthy option to begin the day. My companions also had mini morning buns.\n\n*Brioche French Toast ($16): I surrendered to my long craving. This is some of the best French toast I've had. Dipped in egg and cinnamon batter, with candied walnuts, caramerlized banana and toffee brittle. The toffee is too sweet and is not my thing. I peeled off the caramel off my banana. French toast itself is excellent. \n\n*Huevos Rancheros on Skillet ($17): fluffy scrambled egg on a bed of refried beans. I don't remember this item from last time. My companion said it was tasty.\n\n*Pancakes and Eggs ($17): their pancakes are too thick to my preference, but crispy and not chewy. Bacons crispy and scrambled eggs are far better than Peppermill and other breakfast joints around the strip. \n\n*Classic Breakfast ($17): three eggs any style, in my case scrambled, with bacon or sausage. Apple chicken sausage is better than Peppermill and Society Cafe. Potato are thinly sliced and roasted, almost like warm potato chips!\n\nI notice this time that they no longer offer the Double Down Breakfast which allows you to choose any two breakfast items for $18. Inflation?\n\nOverall verdict: The perfect breakfast spot if you want a relaxing, quiet, and beautiful environment with great service. That it's in the Wynn suggests the clientele is more polished. Sometimes I come in here and just read over coffee, which is served in a thermal, before I order food. They just leave me alone. It's my staple breakfast joint in Vegas.\n\nThey don't take reservation so get there early on holidays."

We couldn't get enough of it, and normally I'm done with French toast after a pitiful half-slice.

The Wynn does have some of the best visual stimulation around...the waterfalls, the pool, the decor, and the environment is just great.\n\nThe burger and sandwich quality was excellent. The burgers are HUGE and flavorful. I had a southwest Angus burger with avocado and my friend had their BLT. You'll have to be hungry to eat the whole burger or sandwich...honestly. The hamburger buns are fresh made in house...they tell you but you can also tell with your first bite.\n\nTheir fries...eh...ok...disapointing to be totally honest. The basic fries are just that. and their steak fries, which I had, were over-seasoned beyond what I could handle. Hopefully just a mistake but it's just fries...they were pretty bad.\n\nThe milkshakes are what make the Terrace Point worth a trip. They serve triple thick shakes and they are worth every penny at $7 each. With 6+ flavors to choose from, I had their Vanilla and it was anything but your run-of-the-mill shake. Whip cream was fresh made, cherries were some of the best ever, and the shake size was ideal.

I'm sure this would be nice for lunch or dinner, especially if you want to take your time. We, on the other hand were rushing, but still I liked it and would come back again."

The food was way below anything I would expect from the Wynn and the service was horrendous!  Our waitress screwed up my order of Blueberry Pancakes and eggs.  How is that possible?  I received a regular pancake and it took her 20 minutes to replace the pancake..at first she was just going to bring me some blueberries to put on top..which is not a blueberry pancake..needless to say...After 20 minutes of waiting I canceled it.  My eggs were delivered to me cold.  My husbands chicken and waffles were pretty bad too.  The chicken was flattened..breaded and fried..you could barely cut it.  What did the manager do?  took the pancake off my bill.  Off the list!"

The Terrace Pointe Cafe, with its fantastic sunlight views, extremely attentive service, and meticulously clean environments, made me instantly enamored with the restaurant. \n\nIf you're a fan of eggs benedict, you'll love this place.  They offer crab cake, pork belly, and classic eggs benedict, or a trio of all three with *no sides*, so it's all benedict, all the time.  My friends got the biscuits, which were similarly drowning in gravy (though she loved it), and my friend got the steak frites, which were pretty passable, though it cooked medium despite asking for medium rare (understandable on such a thin cut, though).  \n\nThe main issue, I think, was just how *heavy* everything was.  Their hollandaise, while still tasty, is a crazy heavy, especially when paired with thick, salty bacon and/or fried crab cake.  Their bloody mary, at $16, was garnished with just a lemon and an olive, and even after I squeezed the entire damn lemon in, was still pulpy with tomato and salt.  A dash more lemon juice in both food and drink would have gone a long way :P  \n\nThe service, and perhaps the unwillingness to wait in The Buffet line, are the main draws of this place.  Our servers were warm, attentive, and quickly brought us the check (as we were in a rush.)  Overall, I think there are better dining options, unless you want to be fawned over for an hour or two.  Then, I'd probably give this place another shot.\n\n---\n\nsweet: great service\nbitter: heavy on the palate, a bit pricey."

It's right by the Wynn's pool and I guess it could be kind of awkward watching people swim as you eat, but hey the view of the pool is pretty! The only bad thing is that there are these black birds flying over you and picking off the food leftover on the table. \n\nWhat we got:\nBenedict Trio ($24): it was your choice of either pulled pork, lobster, and traditional. You could pick one of each or pick whatever of the 3 you wanted. I ended up getting one of each just so I could try them all. Eggs were cooked perfectly for each of them, once you cut into them, the yolk started flowing out. For the pulled pork...pork was kind of hard and chewy which made it hard to cut. Lobster was pretty good, but left a bad aftertaste. The traditional was bland and didn't have much flavor to it. The hollandaise sauce on it tasted bland too and didn't do the dish any justice.\n\nFried Chicken and Waffle ($20): I would have rather gotten this dish than any of the Benedicts. It came with a spicy maple syrup so it gave the waffle a nice kick to it with it being sweet and spicy. The chicken was perfectly fried and crunchy. I would totally get this dish again if I ever came back.\n\nService:\nI forgot our servers name, but she was nice. She didn't come all that often and there were other people taking care of us and getting us things that we needed."

My friends and I had a few hours before our flight and came here in agreement of a semi quick bite, while still having the sit down and order ambiance that we wanted. Once we sat down we ordered an appetizer (hummus plate), soups, and our drinks. 15 minutes later a party gets seated at the next table. 10 minutes after that the same parties appetizers come out. Confused because we still hadn't received our appetizer (it was a cold dish, no cooking involved) or our soup, and with no check in from our waitress at all, I hunt her down and explain if she could check on our appetizers because we're on a slight time crunch. She never came back to update us or apologize but 5 minutes later our soups and appetizer come out. As I begin eating my soup a guy comes to refill our waters and knocks my soup over. He did not apologize, wiped the table and took the spilled soup bowl and rushes away, never returning to offer another bowl or apologize? I call the waitress to tell her (at this point she hasn't checked on us once and keeps avoiding us by checking on every other table but ours &I the party that came 20 minutes after us has finished and are leaving the restaurant) and she responds \"oh.... I'll bring you another one\" awkwardly. I am a very understanding person when it comes to service and am very appreciative towards staff even when they make a mistake (as we all do) but the way our specific waitress/ waiter treated us was horrible!! Food was blah too and did not make up for the service"

Whether you're there during the summer or the winter, Terrance Pointe's got somethin' for you. It's a special little tucked away treat that you can only get in Vegas. \n\nFirst off, the ambiance here is amazing. It's tucked in a less-traveled corner of the Wynn, so it's not your typical eatery. The couches... the couches. So good after you've been in heels for 4+ hours and slept about the same. You can kick off your flip-flops and just relax.\n\nThe service is also beyond expected. The staff knows their stuff, they engage with you and make you feel welcome. They also make amazing recommendations. \n\nThe food and drinks are why we keep coming back, though. Americano fan? GET ON IT. Plain ol' drip coffee connoisseur? Also an excellent choice. In the summer, opt for something lighter like the granola-yogurt-fruit plate. They won't serve you melon; they've got berries and mango for you. The French toast plate -- while not the leanest option -- is well worth it, with ham, cheese, hash browns and eggs to boot. We ordered the eggs over medium and they were served exactly over medium. In the winter, you absolutely must do the tomato soup with grilled cheese. MUST. It'll warm your soul and you'll learn the true meaning of that phrase. \n\nI look forward to visiting Terrance Pointe every time I go to Vegas, hungover or not.

Steve Wynn got the classy swank pimping down- even the air smells better at the Wynn!\n\nOk back to the review for Terrace Point Cafe...I gave it a 3 star but it's not really that bad it's like a 3.75 star worthy.   I just had reasons that I couldn't give it a 4 or 5...here's why:\n\nThe decor inside the cafe is like opulence on opium....like a dreamy tea party with bright colors and beautiful shapes.  The booths are like sitting on clouds and the view of the outdoor is soothing.\n\nThe waitress Nancy was \"super\" nice.  I quote \"super\" because she was extremely overly glare-in-your-face friendly which bit us in the ass (explain later).\n\nOrdered:  \n\nFrench Onion Soup (cheesy and yummy you can't go wrong with cheese, bread and onions).\n\nChicken Quesadillas with sour cream, salsa and guacamole...it was tasty and fulfilling (you get 5 large slices).  I asked for hot sauce and they brought me Tabasco when I really wanted Tapatio but of course the Wynn wouldn't carry such brand *BoOooo*\n\nThey have KILLER FRENCH FRIES here!  Crispy thin seasoned fries that is crunchy good!  Interesting that it was the FRIES that impressed me out of everything.\n\nStay Away From:  Prime Rib Cheesesteak Sandwich with mushrooms and onions...NASTY DRY BLAND disappointment!  The meat tasted like they washed away all the seasoning with water.  It was sad.  I was a sad sad girl.  How do you mess up such an easy dish!  \n\nThat's not the worst part.  Our waitress came to our table afterwards and asked if we wanted a to-go box which we politely declined.  She then asked innocently, \"Are you sure?  You have a 1/2 a sandwich left!  Didn't you enjoy your meal?\"  We told her that the sandwich was dry and bland and asked if they usually serve it with au ju sauce...Do you know what she said?!?!\n\n\"Oh yea...out of all the dishes we have that is like the worst dish to get.  I had it before and it was dry and not good.  I wouldn't recommend it.\"\n\nFirst reaction:  What the hell!?  Why didn't she tell us that when we ordered it!?!?  I think being nice is cool but be honest with your customer!  She basically rubbed it in our faces and at a classy place such as the Wynn Cafe it would've been great to have the sandwich either re-made or taken off the bill...that would've bought my review to a 4 star (lol).\n\nSecond reaction:  WOw...so this wasn't just a bad day for the Philly sandwich but it's ALWAYS this bland!  Even the staff recognized it as a BAD SANDWICH!  I expected more from the Wynn.  The chef should be alerted immediately and he/she should either pull it off the menu or season that bitch!\n\n*sigh*\n\nI'm sorry but I hate it when good restaurants serve bad food...\n\nIf you want a burger or appetizers go here for a leisurely meal but the total bill comes out to almost the same price for the Wynn Buffet so if you want to experience a good meal at the Wynn hit up the buffet instead!\n\nCheck my Wynn Buffet review."

It's topped with a fried egg which added a great richness. \n\nThe lettuce wraps were fairly standard, and tasted similarly to the ones at PF Changs. \n\nMy friend got the steak and eggs, and the steak was perfectly cooked and very tender. \n\nThe service was only so so, which isn't normal for somewhere in the Wynn. It took a really long time to get out food, and just as long to get a check when we were done. \n\nI'll still go back again and again for that waffle! \n\nBut seriously, it is WAY over air conditioned. Dress warm."

Although this place is opened space like deli shop, it still has elegant interior and ambience. You barely can go wrong with here. Breakfast can be a little too bland, other than that, all good. Try their Sea Bass or coconut shrimp. Panini is just ok."

Our server was really nice and not snobby to us at all even though we each only ordered a salad and water...we wanted a fresh start to our day.  my friend and i had the best salad in a long time.  it had the best mushrooms i ever had in my life...im not kidding.\nwe sat inside but we could tell there was a good view of the hotel pool below.  when we go back to Vegas we are for sure hitting this place up again before we head down to the slots for free drinks :)"

            "review": "The Terrace Point Cafe never disappoints. The prices can be a little intimidating, but it is always consistent, and always good. We eat here every time we come to Vegas, and it's usually one of our first stops. The menu changes every so often, but some of the items I like are the pulled pork Benedict, the garden pita, and the seasonal fruit platter. This time I also got to taste the sea bass, and it was delicious. If you order bacon extra crispy, it always come out perfect, and never burnt. To me, whatever you pay is worth it. You can go and get something from the cafe in the casino for a lesser price, but the portion won't be as good, and the quality certainly won't match. The servers never make you feel rushed, and they're very friendly. If you tell them you have a food allergy, someone from the kitchen comes out to address it and make sure everything will be okay. The worst part about this place is that they close at 3pm."

I guess to be in line with the raunchiness of some of my other reviews, I'll say that I had a semi-boner after eating. I've also found out that's called a broner. It'll catch on, kinda like the lemon law thing in How I Met Your Mother."

We found the Terrace point cafe! It was delicious, too bad they cut off breakfast already! SHOOTS!!!! \n\nWe ordered the Kobe Beef Sliders... Juicy, flavorful, and delicious! \nFried Risotto Sticks... i believe they were that.. haha it's been to long. Tasted just like Fried Cheese sticks, but a lot fanciers haha! Everything was great, the filet mignon, the shrimp scampi pasta, the salad! YUM YUM YUM! I WANT IT ALL! \n\nService was a bit slow, and the hostess didn't know what the special of the day was... well I'm pretty sure that's not her job to know, but i would think everyone should know what the special of the day is. =)"

We waited 35 minutes for our food, and of course they got our order wrong.  Did I mention that the place is like half full.  Good thing it wasn't busier, then we might wait an hour for the wrong order.\n\nThey of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  I get to way overpay for the wrong food.  I got lazy and didn't want to leave the resort.  Bad call there."

We ordered the organix mix salad, and beef sliders, truffle fries.\n The food was delicious. If you get the salad, there is no need to add meat, because honestly they dont give you that much for the extra price and the salad itself is savory. \n\nThe sliders were good, typical sliders nothing really special about them, I guess you're better off ordering a burger for the same price as the sliders.\n\nOMGOSH the truffle fries were SO GOOd!!! Definitely would order these again! There were freshly made a d had truffle sauce and cheese over it. So bad for you but ooooo so good.\n\nOver all the prices seemed a little steep, but it is vegas so what do you expect. The serve was good, they seemed really busy but they were attentive."

I ordered the cuban pressed sandwich and that was perfectly crusty on the outside and toasty warm on the inside with just enough mustard. SO ordered the oriental wrap and that was done superbly. I loved the house made chips that came along with my sandwich along with the fried plantains coated with sugar and cinnamon. My friend H ordered the pasta with shrimp. Sauce was a bit on the bland side and they were a little stingy with shrimp. A ordered a burger and it was a great burger. Overall, this was an awesome 24 hour cafe, the only set back is the high price tag. Great food and presentation. :)"

I think I wasn't so much disappointed by the food, but moreso the service.  We were seated right away, but still had so many long waits for our server.  And sometime in the middle of the meal, our server disappeared and someone else showed up.  I realize that these things happen sometimes - but a heads up would have been nice so we could look for the right server.  I had a cheeseburger which was quite tasty but WAAAAY too big.  Some people might think that's a plus, but I had to take off one side of the bun just to manage.  I also think that the food is a tad pricey - but hey, it's Vegas.  The ambiance is great - there are huge windows overlooking the pool area.\n\nIf only I was there for breakfast - I would have loved to try their eggs benedict!"

We asked a worker to change the water and it took about 20 minutes before his new water came out. The other drinks were served within a reasonable time but it took forever just to get water! We probably asked a different waitress/hostess/busboy/supervisor a few times because we didn't know which one was our waitress. It was just water and not in the food so we forgot about it but I just realized that we weren't even offered a discount for an unenjoyable experience. Yes, no biggie for water but it would have been nice for a higher end cafe to offer something more than an embarrassed apology. Unprofessional for the setting but ohh well. \n\nReview of the vegan chickn with scallion waffles:\nIt's pretty good! I ordered this just to try it. The chicken is like a big crispy chicken nugget... Maybe tofurkey? I'm a carnivore though so it wasn't the taste I was looking for that day. \n\nThe scallion waffles (scallions are actually added in the batter!) are served with maple syrup and vegan butter. You don't really taste the scallions and its a good combination. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're vegetarian or vegan, but if ya love your chicken, the cost is the same for real chicken and waffles PLUS eggs! I kinda wished I got the breakfast non-vegan option with eggs instead. \n\nIf you're a carnivore but want to taste a more affordable vegan dish, the veggie burger comes with fries and a chocolate shake for $9! I kinda wish I tried that instead.\n\nReview of the coffee:\nWorth it! The aroma, the strength, mmmm so worth it to wake you up."
