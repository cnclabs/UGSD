A friend from Florida wanted to go so we did. I had the Brooklyn Pastrami. It was a classic hot dog with a slice of swiss (I think, I can't remember; some white cheese), pastrami and mustard. It was good. The pastrami did not compare to Carnegie, but it was tender. The hot dog was better than what I make at home and definitely not the most expensive thing I've eaten on or off the strip. I'd totally go back!"

I first heard of them on the Food Network so have been wanting to try the LA place, but when I found out there was one in Vegas, I was like...gotta try it!\n\nCame here for lunch on our last day. I got the PH dog and my friends each got the Vegas Strip dog. What was given was an average tasting hot dog on a bun (which I would have preferred toasted) with toppings that didn't seem all that great. We ordered off the \"special dogs\" menu which I thought was their classic, but then realized they had a \"classic dogs\" menu as well.\n\nOverall, I didn't think it was anything special and for close to $10, that's an expensive dog!"

It's a small store with a seating area for ~20 people. The prices are fair for The Strip and the portions are big. I usually never crave hot dogs but it's been less than a week since I tried Pink's and I already want to try the Los Angeles location!"

I came here after a long walk on a hot day visiting places on the strip and I was utterly disgusted with my order. I had gotten the mushroom dog with swiss cheese, mushrooms and mayo. First of all, the hot dog wiener itself was ordinary, almost as if I bought the pack of ten from a grocery store along with grocery store hot dog buns. The mushrooms tasted like rubber canned mushrooms that should be stamped inedible. Not only that, but a large dollop of mayo on top of this mess made me want to gag. I immediately regretted my order as I saw it and was even more sad to see $7 go to waste. However, I did really enjoy the chili cheese fries, but only temporarily. The mixture of fake beef and nacho cheese did not bode well for any of my friends and I would not recommend coming here when there are plenty of other great places on the strip. Yelpers, BEWARE.. false franchising!!"

I spent 16 dollars on a plain hot dog and a bacon cheese hot dog with a soda  which I think is way too much for just 3 items , I tried them twice and both times I could have done with out . Maybe I went on bad days but what can I do I will stick to my cliff dogs and Nathans any day sorry pinks"

            "review": "Came here on a Friday morning, May 11, 2012.\n\n$6 for a hot dog is not bad when you see how much they really stack on the condiments (chili, onions, tomatoes)... and that it's Vegas.  I never had one at the original location in Hollywood, so I can't tell you how they compare, if they're any different at all.  The Pink's at Planet Hollywood, though, I'll say I'm a fan of.  The cole slaw was mediocre, but it did make me feel healthier for balancing out the grease I ingested.\n\nThe complaints about the firmness of the bun are spot-on -- you will need a fork to eat your chili dog.\n\nGlancing along the right side of the page reveals a lot of 2- and 3-star reviews and I think it's largely due to unmet expectations.  Let me enlighten you: come if you want something quick and greasy to fill up with, and don't want to stand in line at Earl's.\n\n(No, I did NOT mention stellar service, NOR did I mention cute decor).\n\nWorth making a trek to if you're on the opposite side of the strip?  (30-minute cab on summer weekends?)  No way!  Unless you're craving a decent chili dog.  If I'm in the area, this is another spot on my go-to list."

Vegas has wonderful food! I mean, everything I've tried eating in Vegas was supes yummy...but here... ukkk, seriously?...\n\nFirst of all there was way too much hype about this place and when I finally got here I was disappointed with the food and service. First all, the lady that took my order was alright, no smile, no HI, no \"how are you doing?\", just \"what would you like?\". mmmm negative. \n\nI get my burrito hot dog, and It tastes worst then weinersnitchel...great..\n\nI try the chili cheese fries one of my friends ordered and that tasted WAYYY better then the actual dish they SHOULD be known for. Let me tell you. The fries here are pretty good. I like skinny and crispy fries and Pink's fries were bomb.\n\nThe actual cleanliness of the place? It's foggy/steamy when you step in. The kitchen is pretty much connected on a small strip-like building and the cashier is taking orders from the kitchen...and the only walk way you get is the walkway out to the patio where you eat/dine... If you find that clean, then I applaud to you."

            "review": "So me and my girlfriend planned a Vegas birthday trip with a group of our friends for the weekend back in January. At this time, City Center had just barely opened and we were staying at Aria in the Sky Suites. The Sky Suites at Aria blew me away and they are AMAZING!!! But that's for another review... Anyway, that morning we arrived, we decided to leave our comfy suite at Aria and to take a stroll down the strip. Being that it's January and still winter, I was stupid and brought a thin-ass jacket to wear and of course it did nothing to keep me warm. \n\nAs we walk across the street from City Center into Planet Hollywood, we see some people walking into Pink's Hot Dogs. And since we were all freezing in the cold and hungry, we decided to rush to the door and order up some hot dogs!\n\nLet me make something clear: We're LA folk and we love heading down La Brea Ave in LA to have a Pink's hot dog late at night after leaving the clubs. So you can imagine my excitement as we stepped in through the door and out of the cold. I was gearing up to order myself a \"Martha Stewart\" dog but sadly, they don't offer it at this location. Ok, not a big deal. I'll order whatever is on the menu. I think I had the Holly Madison... Insert sad face. To make a long story short, this did not please me. \n\nI don't care what condiments and sides came with that damn hot dog, when I bit into that thing, I wanted to spit it right out. I know what a Pink's hot dog tastes like and that was not a Pink's hot dog. It was soft and mushy and didn't have that firm, juicy texture that I'm accustomed to at the Pink's in LA. I firmly believe that if you're going to call yourself Pink's Hot Dogs, you better serve it up like it's Pink's Hot Dogs! \n\nAm I being a bit overdramatic? Maybe. But think of it like this... What if you walked into a McDonald's and ordered a Big Mac but it ended up looking like and tasting like something that came from an elementary school cafeteria? Or out of the back of some fat guy's ass? What then? I would rather pass out in the bosom of an obese woman with three eyes, one large breast and one little breast, and a tentacle hanging from her double-chin than eat another of those things. \n\nIf not for beer and gambling, I would have done nothing that entire weekend in Vegas but complain that it's not the same. And since I'm not in Vegas and I'm sober, I'll say it anyway... \n\nIT'S NOT THE SAME!!"

But, I had gotten the Polish Sausage with pastrami, swiss, onions and mustard. and they charge 7.79$!!! Wow, thats a lot of money. Now with that being said, the dog itself was good. The Pastrami, wasn't juicy but it also wasn't dry. I usually like my pastrami, juicy, and a little bit of fat on the outside. The Polish itself was the highlight. The first bite, it's juices ran down my lip and onto my jaw. Great flavor and a great crunch. With that being said, I don't know if I am sold on it being an 8$ dog....plus tax of course."

I'm sure the hot dogs at the original are wonderful but this having been my first impression of Pink's, I think the one in L.A. should disown this one for the shame it's putting on it's name!\n\nI had the Mel B and my sister had some kind of mexican themed one.  Both came out to about $10 each - a little expensive but hey I'm from San Francisco and I pay $5 for really small but really good cupcakes sooo, I thought for $10 these babies must be good!\n\nBoy was I wrong.  I don't think my sister liked hers either but speaking for mine alone - all I could taste was topping and no hot dog.  Is that because the hot dog is that bad?  Because even these toppings weren't good enough to make up for that.  They were just one mess of toppings, none of which seemed to go well with each other and like everything else in Vegas - just way too excessive.  I think these toppings in moderation miiiight have been good.  I'll give this place a point for being such a cute concept, with cute decor, and cute serving ware.  But cute only gets you so far.

This sad rendition of Pinks let me down.\n\nA good dog is hard to find no matter where you look. Since I lucky enough to have the original maybe it is just a bias opinion, but when you say light mustard on a dog and it tastes like the dog is stuffed with mustard it just does not fly with me.   Maybe it has a lot to do with the fact that I waited in line for about the same amount of time I did in sunny California and I was expecting the same amazing culinary experience.... Can i call a hot dog a culinary experience?\n\nThis is turning into a rant of sorts, so I am calling this review... The food was not good, not worth the price, and not worth the experience, so in this case there is no saving grace for this pinks in my eye!! \n\nI guess if you have a craving for a dog and there is no Sams Club near by this might be an option..

I opted for the Chicago Polish which is nothing like a chicago style hot dog -  dressed in mustard, relish, tomatoes and lettuce? Weird. Anyway the polish sausage was pretty big and it had a nice snap to it when bitten, and the inside was nice and juicy and the flavor was pretty savory. Not bad."

A hot dog stand that's been free standing in the same location, with the same look since 1939. To my surprise I was super excited when I found out there's was going to be a Pinks inside Planet Hollywood.\n\nFood: I personally don't think this place is a \"real\" pinks location. The hot dog tastes WAY off than what I originally tasted in LA. The hotdogs were longer and thinner, more bread and also it tasted like rubber. \n\nService: The service is pretty slow, the place is kind of small and it reminds me of Subway. You start your order at one end and you walk to the other to pay. I have no idea why people couldn't concept that idea because it seemed like the place was crowded with confused people looking for a line. \n\nPrice: I believe in LA prices for Pinks are around $3.50-$5 bucks, reasonable. Nope not at Planet Hollywood it was about $8.95+ a hotdog. Honestly for the quality of food and the service combined it really wasn't worth it. \n\nAmbiance: outside seating, super hot it was pretty annoying. The place did feel vintage inside but it was very modernized. \n\nIf your looking for the whole Pink's Experience go to LA. You won't find it here at Planet Hollywood."

Go big or go home. If I get a dog, I want it to be mostly meat inside the bun and all the other toppings pouring out of the top of it. Thats a hot dog. A skinny hot dog covered in onions is as dissatisfying as, well a skinny hot dog covered in onions. The \"grilled\" onions had clearly only been acquainted with the grill top for a few seconds before hoping on to the long twig that was my hot dog, and didn't have any of that yummy caramelized taste that real grilled onions have. The pastrami was plain and dry. Call me picky but isn't pastrami supposed to taste like something other than newspaper? I've never had pastrami this disgusting. And I've had a lot of pastrami in my time. You can make yourself a better dog for a 5th of the price by going to the deli section at your local grocery store. This was like an imitation that reminds you of a real hot dog, if a real hot dog were a gross, tasteless and pathetic lump of turd.\n\nThe only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review was that they sell booze. And I was able to finish half of my friend's giant margarita and get enough of a brain freeze to forget how gross and skinny that hot dog was."

After having it there, I really thought this place was overrated. The hot dogs were just ok, and were definitely not worth the wait in line (at least 30 minutes).\n\nBecause of that, I really did not want to give this location a chance. However, we were leaving Las Vegas and wanted something were it would've be relatively quick. Hesitantly, I agreed to go to Pink's. And you know what, I'm really glad I did.\n\nFor those that do not know where Pink's is, it's outside on the strip. When we got here, I was honestly surprised that there was no line here. I had to initially do a double take to make sure I was at the right location. There were the familiar pictures of celebrities on the wall which helped me know that I was at the right place.\n\nDue to being hungry, I ordered the Spicy Mojave Dog and the Guadalajara Dog. The Guadalajara Dog was good, the mix of sour cream, tomatoes, and relish was a nice combination with the hot dog. I'm not the biggest fan of relish, but I liked it in this case. The Spicy Mojave Dog was pretty awesome. To warn you in advance, make sure you have napkins, a fork, and a knife. I rarely eat hot dogs with a knife and fork, but in this case, you must! The hot dogs have a nice pop when you take a bite, which I love in a hot dog.\n\nThere's no room to eat inside, but there are tables outside for you to sit and enjoy the strip on a nice warm day. Especially after a big night of partying, this is a nice way to recover. \n\nOverall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. The reason I rounded it down to a 3 was due to my experiences at the Hollywood location. Though I'll definitely would come back to this location whenever I'm in Vegas."

Unfortunately even being famished couldn't get me to eat that humongous, monstrous pile of heart attack called the Planet Hollywood Dog. I just couldn't bring myself to do it...I had some fries...but even those were tasteless. This was a complete waste of 20 bucks to be honest..and I wouldn't even care to complain if it was at least good. Do yourself a favor, save your $ & keep walking...it's not worth it."

And, of course, you have to get fries too. There's only outdoor seating, but they have heat lamps. And since it's right on the Strip, it's some good people-watching, which I always appreciate. So if you're at Planet Hollywood, or walking by, and find yourself hungry, don't miss this spot."

Both their classic hot dogs and specialty hot dogs are delicious and more than satisfying; if you're a fan of natural casing then you'll be in heaven.  The menu feels smaller than the legendary Hollywood location's, but they have all the classics and favorites, though sometimes under different names.\n\nI developed a fondness for Pink's while living in LA and I've missed it terribly since I left, part of that is because there isn't much of a Hot Dog scene where I live, so if you are visiting from a city with great Hot Dog joints, you may not be as impressed.\n\nI was dismayed when I didn't recognize the menu, I'd been harboring a mad craving for a Martha Stewart Dog and it wasn't to be found.  Fortunately the cashier helped me identify the Vegas equivalent of the Hollywood dogs and I found it, it is the Showgirl Dog and I highly recommend it.  If you're more in a sausage mood, the Planet Hollywood is a delicious option.  I missed Pink's so much I had both of these gigantic dogs."

There was NO line or wait when we went [on a Friday at around 6pm].. Not much seating, but as they weren't busy it was okay and there was plenty of room.

And you don't have to park your car in some sleazy alley. They don't have a lot of the customized celebrity dogs like they do in LA, but that's not a big deal.  You can put whatever topping you want on it and then name it yourself, if you really want a title to your creation so bad.  My personal favorite is the burrito stuffed with chili and a large 12 inch wiener (any one will do as long as it is large and at least 12 inches)..I call it the Kim Kardashian.\n\nTheir wieners are custom made for them by Hoffys and have a very pronounced snap to the casing when you bite into them.  Their chili tastes like the wonderful brick chili that is so cheap but is ever so satisfying.  I guarantee that whatever you get, you will get heartburn afterwards.  After all, it just wouldn't be Pink's without it."

The thing that bothered me the most besides an expensive, mediocre tasting hot dog was the condiments and cutlery section.  You can tell they purchase the absolute cheapest plastic cutlery (the forks and knives weren't even the same brand!) and ketchup.  Hey Pink's, since you are charging so much for a crappy hot dog do you think you can splurge on some Heinz ketchup packets for your fries and rings?  Thanks."

Yay!  I ordered one, dressed as a Chicago dog and my partner ordered a beef hot dog with minimal toppings. We skipped out on fries as we just wanted a light snack, but we did each get a drink (beer and cider in cans). \n\nWe sat outside in the awesome weather and dug in. My veggie dog was covered in amazing toppings and was delicious. I had to get a fork to clean up the bits that dropped out, I didn't want to leave anything behind.

Their reputation preceded them because I've heard about how famous Pink's is in Los Angeles and I was happy to see that there was one so close to the Bellagio.\n\nI went with a friend of mind around noon.  Pinks is right in front of Planet Hollywood adjacent to the street.  The wait when we got there was only a few minutes but since it was 105 degrees, it was a little uncomfortable.\n\nI ordered the bacon chili cheese dog, a drink, and the chili cheese fries.  The total came out to be just under $17 which is a little steep, but I guess it is to be expected in Las Vegas.  \n\nWhen the food came, I immediately thought, \"how am I supposed to fit this in my mouth.\" (insert that's what she said joke)   There was a normal sized hot dog underneath a mountain of bacon, tomatoes, onions, and chili.  I literally could not pick it up unless I risked having all the insides falling off of my plate.  I had to grab a knife and fork to tackle the foot long an inch at a time.  It tasted fantastic and i could feel my eyes getting heavier immediately from the food induced coma the meat from the chili was putting me in.\n\nAfter I finished my hot dog filled with 3 slices of bacon goodness, I was very stuffed.  I'm usually one with a decent size appetite but the high fatty food filled me up quick. ...and then there were the chili cheese fries to deal with.  It looked as though the workers used a bucket to pour on the chili since there was so much of it and I knew immediately that I had to take it to go and offer it as communal fries.  The few bites I could squeeze into my already full stomach were delicious.  The texture and the size of the fries were crispy and thinner than traditional fries but it worked.  \n\nIts definitely worth a try and I would totally go to Pink's again."

Of course we used it, and it barely made a dent into the final price.\n\nThe hot dog was okay, filled with overflowing toppings. The thing that caught me by surprise was how tough it was to bite through and chew through the outside casing. I mean, I've heard of hot dogs having a good \"snap,\" but this is getting a little ridiculous. I might have chipped a tooth eating their hot dog. That would be a first.\n\nOverall, not really worth a wait of any kind. If you really want to try a Pink's hot dog, by all means go ahead. But if you're itching for a snack to tie you over until the next buffet gorge-fest, I suggest heading over to Earl of Sandwich inside the casino.

But if I was a surfer dude from Redondo Beach out with my buds for a Vegas weekend, this would certainly be my dining destination of choice. Since I'm not, I guess I can be a little more discriminating. But dude, it's Pink's. Well not quite Pink's. Just a reasonable facsimile in an apt setting, Planet Hollywood. \n\nJamie W. and I really wanted some dogs after strolling through the sterile City Center complex which has none of the kitsch that really is Vegas. Luckily, Pink's has kitsch to spare in its patio setting outside the hotel entrance. The menu looked familiar. We decided to each get a $4.75 Giant 12-inch Jalapeno Dog with nacho cheese and chili, and share a $6.50 \"Planet Hollywood\" Dog, which consisted of a Polish sausage, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon and cheese (see photos). Oh did I mention the fries, too? Nice and tasty they were. \n\nIndigestion thy name is Pink's. The Jalapeno Dog has that snap to the wiener that I don't care for much. I prefer a meatier dog to the tooth, and the mustard was way overwhelming, but chili, cheese and diced onions are bulletproof on a dog as far as I'm concerned. The \"Planet Hollywood\" Dog has quite a pile of toppings to maneuver in your mouth starting with the bacon strips lording over the sausage already drowning in melted cheese. The mushrooms seemed almost incidental to the creation, but they were good. Hell, it was all good in a bad, bad way. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars....quite an abundance of toppings on those dogs but not quite the Pink's I remember in LA \nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...hell, it's just a patio...in pink \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...just keep moving the line and the dogs will eventually be there \nTOTAL - 3 stars...a middling experience based on a distant memory of the Pink's in LA"

I really do enjoy a good hot dog when they can be found and the last couple I have had were very average. Also seeing this on food network a few time made for some big expectations. \n\nI was excited to try pink's and the line was moving fast. I normally just go with a normal dog with ketchup when trying new places but the bacon burrito dog was sounding good and it sounded big! \n\nWe got our order pretty fast and the serve pepsi bleh, so went with sierra mist when in this situation. \n\nThen I went for the ketchup and then ooooo no cisco ketchup, blehhh, how could you pink's? I don't think I've had to have cisco ketchup since I was at the last country fair. That would be my only complaint here. Ketshup is one of the only condiments I enjoy and if I'm eating a top quality hot dog and fries, I need the good stuff! \n\nAlas, my giant burrito filled with bacon, chili, cheese and 2 hot dogs was really to be devoured and it was. It was great, filling, and had some hearty chili which is something you either like or don't, but I did. \n\nI was pretty full after that and I would have this again for sure. \n\nIf I had coke, some heinz, and a cooled indoor seat, you could have had that 1 extra star!"

There is something magical about standing in line for 45 minutes to get one of a huge number of various hotdogs.  Some more unique than others.  It would take me 45 minutes just to decide which i wanted.\n\nThe Pink's in Las Vegas is, unfortunately, not the destination that the original is.  The menu is smaller.  Much smaller.  There are a handful of the unique dogs and a few standards too.  What I really wanted they don't have (The Mulholland Drive and the Lord of The Rings).  They do have a Planet Hollywood Dog (fitting as that is the casino in which Pink's LV is located).  The Planet Hollywood dog is similar to the Mulholland Drive.  The same toppings of nacho cheese, grilled mushrooms and bacon but has a hotdog rather than a sausage.  Close but no cigar.  Instead I opted for a Pastrami Reuben Dog topped with pastrami, sauer kraut and mustard.  It was fine but nothing spectacular.  I did appreciate the snap of the natural casing.  That is the signature of a Pink's dog.  But there was no wait at all.  I walked right up to the register and ordered.  A couple of minutes later I had my food.  There was no anticipation of what I was about to receive. There were no celebrity photos to gawk at.  At least none that I can remember seeing.  I wasn't in there long enough to notice such things.\n\nIn the end, my hot dog was fine but this location just lacks that certain something that makes the original so special.  Next time I have a Pink's craving, I think I'll just live with it until I can get to LA for the real deal."

I'm a guac/avocado type guy so I had the Kim Kardashian and I thought it was pretty good.  It's basically a BLT+guac hotdog.We sat on the patio and it was a very relaxing meal. The food wasn't too heavy and it felt like the perfect amount at the time.\n\n I didn't think the food was overpriced or overhyped at all (very different than most of my other reviews)  Sure you are paying almost $10 for a hotdog and Earl's is right there but its all relative. You could compare the hotdog to the 24 hour cafes in the area and the price is very reasonable.\n\nAs long as there are no lines or just short lines, I'd go back and try it again. Besides crossing my fingers and hoping it would be free, there's nothing I'd really change about the hot dog I had or the experience,  just like the  singer Pink says, \"you are perrrrfect to me\" (not really my favorite song but it's my poor attempt to be clever with names)"

After eating there, I checked the reviews and was amazed to find some positive statements.  The hot dogs were thin footlong dogs, just boiled to heat them up.  What little flavor it had was quite bad.  The fries didn't have a bad taste, they had no flavor at all-  neither offensive or enjoyable.  Prices were typical Vegas, which is to say high, the food quality was poor.  I have been struggling to get the flavor, such that it was, out of my mouth for the last 20 mins.

Can you believe?? all those toppings and it still didn't seem all that great!\n\nSO WHATS THE BIG DEAL??\nI guess it's a tourist attraction, obviously.. Some people like it, some people don't. best way to know try it out for yourself! it's not like its disgusting. just like theme park food.\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n- Seating area is a lovely place to cool down! that's for sure!"

The dogs seemed precooked, the buns were plain, and the mushrooms looked canned. The Planet Hollywood dog was damn near $8 alone. I had to ask for a side of nacho cheese, because the PH dog here only comes with a slice of what looked like kraft cheese. The prices were at least $2 more than the LA location, but I guess its understandable since its Las Vegas. The fries weren't freshly prepared like the LA location either. AND to top it off, they didn't have grape Crush soda or Yoo-Hoo like the LA location. \n\nService: The cashier chicks were nice. The dogs and sides were served up/made in assembly line unlike the personal attention you get from one person at the LA location. \n\nOverall, it was just MEH. I'd rather drive 4 hours, then wait in line for another hour to have an authentic Pink's hotdog. I probably won't come back here unless they somehow manage to replicate everything that the LA location offers. This place seemed like the \"McDonalds\" version of Pink's. The only good thing is that they accept credit cards, while the LA location is only accepts cash."

We started our night grabbing some Fat Tuesdays at the Mirage and doing the usual Vegas Strip exploring. We were walking for some blocks now, and realized that we were smelling some delicious meat from somewhere nearby, funny because we had been having some cravings for Hot Dogs lately. We walk across the street to Planet Hollywood and are trying to figure out where the smell is coming from. Can you tell how buzzed we were at this point?? Lol. Anyways, BEHOLD-- PINKS HOT DOGS right in front of us. YES! We didn't hesitate to order. We both ordered the classic Hot Dog, no toppings, except Ketchup for me, and Mayo for him, and a side order of some fries. We received our food fairly quickly, and the employees were very nice. First thing we noticed was how HUGE these hot dogs were, WITHOUT any extra toppings. We dig in, and DAMN these were SOOOOOO Good!!!! Crunchy sausage, warm bun, SO perfect. The fries were also delicious. That is literally all we wanted to eat the rest of the weekend, and we even swore we'd go back before we flew back home. Sure enough, after a great night at XS, we couldn't wait to go back to PINKS, in fact we went back, ordered the same thing, TWICE, that's right we got seconds, after our seconds. It's fast, a very reasonable price for what you are getting, and the perfect drunk food. i definitely recommend it when you're in town. I'm so sad there is none in Northern California/Bay Area, hopefully we see one soon."

We tried the hot dog with bacon, chili and cheese. It was huge yet absolutely glorious. Since we weren't eating it as a meal but as a mid-day snack, it was large enough to split for 2 people. I kept scooping up the chili and onions that fell onto the plate. I think I enjoyed that the most.\n\nIf not for the awesome dogs, nothing else would stand out to me about this spot. The location itself was okay. Not much room to eat when it's absolutely cold outside like it was the week we were there. We ended up just hanging out inside the small location. It wasn't necessarily an enjoyable experience being that it was so cramped but the delectable nature of the food made up for it.\n\nI thought the fries were over-priced and since I'm not a fry lover anyway, I didn't feel it was worth the money. I hoped to make it back to Pink's one more time before leaving since they have such an extensive menu, but I never got a chance.\n\nJudging by other reviews comparing this one to the original in Los Angeles, It's a shame I never tried the original location when I was out in LA a year ago. Just another excuse to travel though and I'm always looking for that.\n\nSo, will I be back? Um, YEAH. Of course.

The first bite I took was all tortilla, which never happens in the one in Hollywood. The bacon wasn't as crisp and the cheese was all at the end of my burrito. I was disappointed with the onion rings and it made me want to walk to Canter's in Treasure Island because they're onion rings are really good. Usually, a bacon burrito dog is greasy and it drips down your arm as you're eating it, well...here, it didn't. I did miss seeing the line of people making my hot dog like in Hollywood but I guess Vegas had to be different. Needless to say, this place isn't as great as the original.

The only seating was on a patio which was ok with the misting fans but those darn Pigeons . It made it very uncomfortable to enjoy my meal for fear of being pecked at my feet. So let's get to the pros location was right across the street from my hotel which had a pedestrian bridge. I ordered the Planet Hollywood(located at the Miracle Mile Shops at PH) it was a polish sausage with grilled onions/mushrooms nacho cheese and bacon got an order of fries as well. The dog itself wasn't salty like typical sausages which I appreciated but not much flavor. Although I liked the size considering the price it made it difficult to get all the toppings in every bite so they could have a party . The price came to $14 that was w/o a drink which is the cheapest thing I got out. I did notice on the menu they had a souvenir cup for $20 which was refillable for $10 which for LV I think is a great deal. The fries were good basic nothing special and the cashier was nice. I would try again bc like I said I'm from SC so I won't(actually can't lol) make my final judgement until I've had their chili dog. Until we cross paths again"

The first eatery that caught her eye was Pink's Hot Dogs located outside Planet Hollywood but still around the premises because she was thinking of Top Dog in Berkeley. You really couldn't miss it with it's big pink sign. \n\nThere was a super extensive menu of dogs, burgers, burritos, soda and alcoholic beverages, sides, and desserts. We chose only one hot dog to share, a Naked Polish, since we weren't looking for all the fix-ins. Can you really justify a $6 Polish dog? And that's before tax too. Maybe it was possibly for the polish dog size and since we were in a tourist attraction city, but I wouldn't want to pay this price on a daily basis. If it included a drink as a meal, then maybe that's a deal. Yes, the Polish was spicy, juicy, and hot. But there wasn't anything special about the bun. \n\nAfter consuming this expensive snack, I thought to myself I can't wait to get back to the Bay Area so I can really be spoiled and eat a good hot dog from Top Dog for $3.25 each. \n\nFamily owned since 1939, it's always worth a try for something new with a little flair!"

It was a good hot dog, but definitely not worth the hype. We ordered the Vegas Strip dog which came with 2 hot dogs, guacamole, jalapenos, chili cheese, mustard and onions. We also got the Planet Hollywood dog which was a polish dog that came with grilled onions, mushroom, bacon and cheese. Both tasted decent. The chili cheese fries were mediocre.

As a fellow Chicago-ian, I'd say I've had my fair share of Chicago dogs and you know a good hot dog isn't good unless you have the right condiments/toppings to go with your dog. \n\n I thought the Vegas version of Pink's was much more weak than the original location mainly because it feels absolutely cramped inside and you'll probably feel guilty for blocking the entrance trying to decide which hot dog you want. Once my bf finished holding up the line trying to find the RIGHT combination for his hot dog, we placed our order and got it within 5 minutes.  The hot dogs were pretty average and they loaded it up with tons of toppings which is nice, but my hot dog was missing out on a ton of ingredients that defines a Chi-town dog. What happened to the onions, tomatoes, and mustard on my hot dog, Pink's!? Instead I got lettuce, relish and a pickle. I'm hoping this was some sort of mistake, nonetheless we ate our food and and went on our way."

It's a small restaurant with outdoor seating and fans and when we went, it wasn't packed at all. We each ordered different types of hot dogs and ordered jello shots. I ordered the Show Girl Dog and it was not bad. They poured a lot of tomatoes, onions, and relish which was cool but the hot dog itself is thin and could even barely taste it with all the toppings I had. But I really think I should have picked a better choice. And for the jello shots, terrible. Do not get them. It may look green and blue and delicious but it sucks. You might as well take a straight shot of vodka instead. That's how bad it was. But they did give us a free set of fries for ordering the shots."

Thus I was really excited when I saw that Pink's had opened a storefront right on the strip in Vegas.  \n\nAfter a long night of debauchery, I walked halfway across the strip just so I could eat at Pink's.  I have to give them credit, they sure know how to jazz up a hot dog.  I ordered a spicy Mojave Dog, which is a polish sausage with nacho cheese, guacamole and jalape\u00f1o peppers on it.  I ordered relish on it as well.  \n\nThe combination works well in theory as well as in practice.  But in practice all of that stuff on a hot dog makes it damn near impossible to eat as you would normally.  Picking it up makes all the toppings fall off, and a sloppy mess gets all over your hands.  So I had to resort to eating the dog with a fork and knife.  I felt pretty stupid, but it was the only way to do it and plenty of people around me were doing the same.  \n\nBut eating like that made the bun soggy, which is not good.  I appreciate the effort they put into dressing up a hot dog, but I only give it three stars because I've had amazing \"gourmet\" hot dogs in Chicago before, with toppings piled high, but with which I could still eat as hot dogs are intended to be eaten - with your hands."

Since I like to keep track of various beverages to keep me satisfied as I make my way from one of Las Vegas Boulevard to the other - I was happy to stumble upon this little pink frozen delight.  Next time I pass by Planet Hollywood, I will stop to fill my hands with Pink's Lemonade Slushie (avec booze)... in hopes that it will last until I can refuel with a mango margarita on the rocks at Margaritaville.

I'm from LA and have been to the original Pinks, so my initial feelings were a bit mixed, but I decided to give a go.    \n\nWe had about an hour before our movie started so we figured we had plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  A nice bonus of this location was that we were able to sit around the edge of the restaurant and watch college football in the sports betting area.  I was hoping that my Rival College team would lose, but I guess that is what I get for wishing ill on a team...even my rivals.\n\nIf there were half stars I would have given Pink's 3.5, but I rounded down for a couple reasons.  One of reasons was that the speed of service left a bit to be desired.  It was a pretty busy Saturday night and they only had two people working (one in the kitchen and one at the register) so service was slow.  There was a part of me that thought the menu items were a little over priced...but I rounded down more for the slow service\n\nNow to the important part, the food:\n\nThe Las Vegas hot dog - Came with cheese, chili, jalapenos, guacamole and two hot dogs.  This was definitely the better of the two dogs we tried.  It was a little less than $7.  Really though how can you not like chill and cheese on a hot dog...everything else was just a bonus.\n\nThe Spicy Mojave (with sauerkraut) - The extra sauerkraut definitely saved this hot dog.  It just didn't seem like much without it, especially for almost $7.  \n\nChili Cheese Fries - I think this was the highlight of the meal.  There was a great portion of chili and cheese.  And the fries were perfect.  They were a little thicker on than a pencil, crispy outside soft inside.\n\nIf you are looking for some comfort fast food while watching a game...or many games at once...this could be a fun spot for you to hit."

It needs a bigger area, some indoor seating, and a better looking patio -- it feels like they built it as an afterthought because they had some extra space left in a wall. It really should be built better.\n\nHowever, I found the hotdogs to be fantastic! That's why it gets all four stars. They're a bit spendy for hot dogs, but when you've got bacon, sour cream, onions, relish, ketchup, and kraut on it -- it's not exactly going to be cheap. The dogs themselves weren't exactly top-notch, but the toppings all over and the ginormous size really made the dog great.  Next time I'm back in Vegas I will definitely stop here again. It's perfect for a quick dog fix over lunch, with some incredible topping combos that you won't see anywhere else.\n\nIf you're in Vegas, stop at Pinks!"

And the hot dogs weren't the big beefy jumbo hot dogs, so it did not seem special or elevated enough to warrant the price. These were standard sized hot dogs, longer than the bun. \n\nBut I still give it 4 stars because as Alice L. said, the wait in LA is at minimum 1 hour (if you're lucky), versus getting served here within 5 minutes or less. Not sure if it's the timing -- around Xmas holiday on a weekday, but service was fast, and the cashier almost looked a little bored. Kind of a young girl who answered your questions, but had zero energy or friendliness. Looked like she did not want to be there at all, and you were inconveniencing her by being there. Ah well, I had a Check-in offer for a free hot dog with purchase of two other hot dogs. May as well make the most of it! \n\nWe got onion rings -- crispy and thickly battered. \n\nCheese fries -- liquid cheese was good, but the fries alone seemed extremely over salted. Like to the point it tasted bad. \n\nNacho chili cheese dog -- gooey cheese and chili (no beans, which is great for my husband!) and onions. We opted to not have mustard on it because it's a strong flavor and IMO didn't mix in well. \n\nBrooklyn/pastrami dog -- My husband had it, and they were surprisingly plentiful with the pastrami. \n\nBBQ/cole slaw dog -- my favorite, just because I love cole slaw. But since hot dogs are salty, I feel like the cole slaw adds a little sweetness and texture. A bit light on the bbq sauce, but still good overall. \n\nI don't think there's any indoor seating, only outdoor. I think most people were opting for takeout orders. FYI: we couldn't finish everything in one sitting and the hot dogs held over very well a few hours later. \n\nGreat spot, convenient to everything on the strip.

            "review": "Pink's is entering its 73rd year in business. Admittedly, when comparing prices with the original Los Angeles venue, the Vegas spot appears much more expensive. Predictable.\n\nNot really seeing a deathly spicy option (not saying that I was gonna find one), I got whatever could be interpreted as spicy to some people. The Spicy Mojave Dog ($8.49) was my choice. Yeah, you read that right. It was gonna basically be $9 with tax for a damn hot dog. Polish sausage, nacho cheese, pickled jalapenos, grilled onions, guacamole, and tomatoes.\n\nIt looked and tasted like your basic hot dog bun here. With the larger Polish sausage and an abundance of toppings, it really needed one of those large gourmet buns to even give me a shot to pick it up. Fork and knife would have to do.\n\nFlavor-wise, it did the job. It's basically as good as I could have expected this to be. Great snap from the Polish dog. Nacho cheese felt like it came from a container. The veggies and the guacamole tasted fresh. My issue is simply the price. There's no way this poor panda would even want to pay around $9 for a hot dog, even if edible gold was attached to this sucker. Besides, I'd take the edible gold and try to extract monetary value from it anyway.\n\nI look at the Yelp reviews for the Los Angeles Pink's, and it's around a three-star average, same as the Vegas spot. Any complaints are likely directed at the price or the hot dog not living up to the hype. The line's also longer in L.A., so that probably also affects the reviewer's rating. Still, it makes me wonder if the Los Angeles spot is better.\n\nPink's was good for the experience. I can't complain much about the food other than not being able to pick it up. But I also don't want my wallet to have a reason to riot again."

It was so bomb!\n\nPlace has no inside seating, but have strong cooler fans.

Having one of these artery clogging bad boys after a night of debauchery just hits the spot.\n\nWe ordered the chili cheese dog and the Planet Hollywood dogs.  There was a lot of food on the dog (mushrooms/bacon/cheese), and while it was extremely messy it was very good..  Finished it all, and I would do it again.  Since we stayed at Planet Hollywood we actually repeated the same meal after our second night of debauchery.\n\nAre they overpriced?  Yes, but a lot of things in Vegas are.  Should a buffet really be $30 or a burger be $16-18 without fries?  I think not, so when you drop $6-8 on a dog, it's not really that bad."

            "review": "Ok so I ordered two chili dogs, and although they weren't the most amazing hotdogs I have ever eaten, they were reasonably good. The skin on the hotdogs was a tad bit tough but not overwhelming. The chili had a peculiar but subtle taste (Not nasty or anything, just something I've never had and I'm not sure if it was for the better or worse....meh).\n\nI will say that the size of the hotdogs and the amount of fries are reasonable, and can satisfy any sensible eater. I agree with some of the other posters that the hotdogs can get a bit greasy, and also they only have outdoor seating so be aware if you decide to grab something to eat from here. But aside from that, I do think that Pink's Hot Dogs is in a excellent location on the Vegas strip. And with the restaurants outdoor seating makes eating at Pink's that much better. Especially during the more cooler evening hours when the night life of Vegas really comes to life.\n\nIn the end I don't think that this Pink's Hot Dogs sells the kind of hotdogs that will convert you to an absolute hotdog lover but they are decent and decently satisfying. I feel that one of the main reasons I would go back to Pink's Hot Dogs is because of it's location. With their outside seating who can pass up the chance to sit outside while eating a relatively decent hotdog and enjoying the Vegas strip action."

It comes wrapped in a flour tortilla and although nothing really special to mention there it at least didn't have a heavy taste feel to it which was nice. The hot dogs themselves had an odd taste to them that I couldn't really place to, but I did admire that it had the snap to it in each bite (that saved things for me). My highlight had to be the chili as it did feel like a tummy filler, but was seasoned well so it was a pleasant gulp down the hatch. The only drawback was that the run off from the chili did seep through the tortilla and leave it to be an orange oiled down mess at the final few bites.\n\n So I guess all in all you can't go wrong and for me if the LA location is out of reach so to speak having the LV experience works just the same. The price is there for sure and although the taste is hit or miss, it still is worth taking in when it's all said and done. It was the perfect precursor to a drunken evening, but that stayed in Vegas!"

I roll up to Pink's Hot Dogs expecting a great hot dog experience and a meal to quiet that growling in my belly...  It wasn't.\nIt was actually very disgusting.  And some how...2 chili dogs, 1 order of fries, and 2 Gatorades cost me $23!  If I went to Sonic, it would have been about half that price and taste 5x better.\nI got the hot dog about 4 minutes after my order was completed.  The hot dogs didn't even taste like they were cooked completely, and the chili...well that was the most disgusting part...  The chili tasted like it was just squeezed out of whatever bag it came from and put directly on my hot dogs.  It was pasty and gritty, and was barely warmed up.  And the taste of the chili....well it tasted DISGUSTING!\nThe fries were okay.  At least they were cooked.  They server those skinny, little, shoe-string fries BTW like at Steak & Shake.\nAlso, no person who worked for the casino had any idea where this place was.  We literally had to just wander around until we found it on our own.\nI will never ever go back and try that place again."

It was ok except for the fact that my bun completely fell apart, thus defeating the purpose of eating a hot dog. My friend had the bacon chili cheese dog, which I had a bite of and really enjoyed. The bacon added just the right amount of salty goodness. The fries here were really tasty, and although we didn't order onion rings, almost every other table around us had them so I'm guessing they're popular. \n\nWhat is nice about this place is its location on the strip and the outdoor seating. A great place to people-watch and enjoy the weather. As a sun-starved Seattleite, it was nice to be able to get some vitamin D and UV rays in since most of our Vegas cavorting usually happens at night.\n\nIf you want yummy hot dogs and fries, or just some hangover food that hits the spot, i'd recommend. If you're a tourist in Vegas and are trying to experience Pink's in the city of sin, this surely isn't it. Too clean, too friendly, too flashy. The down and dirtiness, and hour-long wait in line that you'll find at the original Pink's in LA is what makes it special, for better or for worse."

While I have been to Hollywood a few times, I have not had the pleasure of dining at the original Pink's, therefore, I don't have a reference for that comparison. This particular location was A-Okay. I ordered a veggie burger and it was divine. It was so great that I went twice during our  trip to Vegas. My husband ordered a chili cheese dog and did not like it at all. Ironically, he likes the chili dog at Sonic drive-thru much better than the one served here. This was quite concerning since hot dogs are their specialty.

Heading into the first bite, I definitely did have high expectations, mainly because I was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent Groupon deal. However, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. It's not fair to compare this to Costco hot dogs on price.\n\nWhen I tried my friend's chili cheese dog, my eyes, taste buds, and probably everything else just lit up. Yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and grilled onions - was really delicious and made me wish that I had chosen it. Instead, I had gone with the Planet Hollywood dog, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. I also loved the polish sausage, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the nacho cheese went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nWe also shared some deluxe chili cheese fries, which had a crapload of toppings on them. In hindsight, if I had known how loaded the hot dogs would be, I would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. Oh well, live and learn.\n\nAnyway, I've seen the other reviews, and I'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original Pink's - which I still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. Not considering the price, the only problem I have is that I'd rather go to Earl of Sandwich, which is right next door and which I love to death, so I might not really see this place much at all in the future. Oh well, it was yummy knowing you."

We ordered the dog without onions, but it came out standard, so he brought it back to have it re-made. The cook was nice about it, probably because there was hardly a line at 4 pm, and served up a new one within 3 minutes, spit-free! It was interesting... glad we tried, but wouldn't order it again. It is also best eaten with the wrapper, because the burrito drips chili grease... yum!\n\nWith our $15 Groupon, we had to fork out a whopping $0.52. Overall, $7.52...

I've experienced better... exactly what I was thinking!\n\nAfter all the hype I've heard about the famous Pink's Hot Dogs in LA, I SERIOUSLY thought I would have been blown away by the experience... Maybe its because of the hype that shot my expectations through the roof, but wouldn't you think with all the hype, it should at least make me want to come back for more? \n\nBut I'm the kind of girl that always gives a place the benefit of the doubt, perhaps I ordered something not-so-amazing on the menu -- The Pastrami Reuben Dog, I honestly thought this was a pretty good choice!! Equipped with hot dog, pastrami, mustard, swiss cheese & sauerkraut... I mean its not the fattiest of the bunch, but lets be honest the scorching hot weather was taking a negative toll on my appetite. Regardless of my choice, I had the chance to have a bite of a few others -- The Planet Hollywood, The Vegas Strip Dog, Chili Cheese Fries... Nothing really sang to me ya know? In other words, I was hoping for more, something more memorable and amazing rather than just a meal to fill me up. I think I'll give the LA Pink's a chance, but if that doesn't change my mind, who knows what will."

Two hot dogs, served with chili, mustard, guacamole and jalapenos. Very tasty, but a bit on the heavy side. Especially in 100+ degree weather since there's only outdoor seating. Sis had the Bacon Chili Cheese Dog, which was pretty good too. Gotta love chili! Had a bite of the Pastrami Burrito. Now that was just weird. Hot dog, pastrimi, chili, cheese and onions. Odd combo and taste. Pass. Lastly, their fries were very good. Seasoned and crispy, just the way I like it. \n\nAfter combo-ing my hot dog, it came out to like $12! Wow.

The cashier was nice.\n\nI actually really enjoyed the hot dog, which was of an ample size overspilling with toppings. However, at the end of the day, this is still a hot dog and I felt not quite worth the price. Nevertheless, the hot dog was made of good quality meat with none of the processed texture and artificial flavoring as expected from supermarket hot dogs. In addition, the chili that Pink's use for their hot dog taste like legitimate chili of slow-cooked ground beef simmered over low fire in a soup base of onions and other spices. The raw tomatoes threw me off in terms of texture and flavoring, but at the end of the meal, I was glad for it because the bacon, chili, and cheese on the hot dog was actually very heavy for a standalone meal. The turnaround was relatively quick where I never felt like I was just standing around doing nothing, but I would have been more impressed if they actually finished my order before I even walked out the restaurant to find a table. There is no waiter service so I cannot say much about the service, but the lady at the cashier was patient in letting us take our time mulling over what to order."

Overpriced, mediocre hotdogs (where's the beef?) made worse by forgettable service (people who work there look like they want to be anywhere BUT there). Anyway, I would save my $7 and go somewhere else, the small hotdog stand outside Home Depot on Rainbow & Charleston serves up way better hotdogs at 1/4 the price. Ironic since this is how Pink's started. I'm disappointed that Pink's would even lend their brand to this poseur, it lacks the awesome HOT-dogs, charm, nostalgia, location vantage and obviously the patrons swarming the original dinky shack."

I had some money left over on my groupon so I bought some cookies, which i gave away. I was very disappointed by the hot dog, the bun was dry and the meat was hard, almost crunchy. It was very long but very thin and didn't taste good at all. The fries were okay, but they were very thin. Overall, I was disappointed by the hot dog, it was definitely more hype than substance."

That's that famous hot dog spot in LA where all the celebrities go and people line up for 2 hours to get a hot dog!\" Situated right in front of Planet Hollywood, I knew I just to get one of those wonderful meats encased in tube form, as Anthony Bourdain would say...lol. The place itself is really small, you order, slide down to the left to pick up your food, and there's an outdor patio where you can eat. There's a quite extensive menu including not only hotdogs but burgers as well and a myriad of toppings...the most familiar being chili and cheese to the exotic of avocado and sour cream. I went with the planet hollywood dog. A polish sausage with grilled mushrooms, onions, cheese, and bacon. It was hearty and delicious. A lil pricey at around $8 but I think it was worth it....will definitely be checking out other menu offerings the next time I'm in Vegas!"

            "review": "First off, this is nothing like the Pinks in LA. I've been living in San Diego for a year now, after having lived in LA and I miss Pinks. So when I was in Vegas and saw Pinks on the strip I got really excited. As soon as I walked in, I should have known. This place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. This caught me off guard considering the real Pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. Next was the menu. I didn't recognize a single 'special hot dog'. The original Pinks special hot dogs either have a LA themed name or are named after a celebrity. The Pinks in Las Vegas has special dogs named with a Las Vegas theme. So I had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the Martha Stewart dog. She had a list behind the counter that listed which special hot dogs were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. Uhhhh... ok. So basically this Pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name Pinks slapped on.\n\nNow for the food. I ordered a Chili Cheese Dog (with a Polish sausage subbed for the hot dog) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. I waited a few minutes and my order number was called. I went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as I saw the French fries which are nothing like the LA Pinks French fries. I made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original Pinks, and a woman, also from LA, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nSo was the food good? Yeah, it was decent. But not worth the 13 bucks I spent on it. The shoe-string fries were nothing like the Cajun fries (that the LA Pinks serves) I was expecting but the were good nonetheless. Worth the $5.99 I paid for them? No. But that's what you get for eating on the strip. The Polish sausage was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. But overall I'm glad I tried it.\n\nThe verdict: if you're on the strip near Planet Hollywood and craving hot dogs, this is probably the best you'll find. However, if you're a lover of the original Pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. You'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in."

The only problem is, the prices are more than twice of what I used to pay in Los Angeles.\n  \n$6 or 7 bucks for a chili dog, and $6.00 for a plain hot dog with kraut and mustard.

Although not the best hot dogs I've ever had, I do have to say that they were probably the most FILLED hot dogs I've ever had. There was almost a bowl full of chili on the chili-cheese dog, and a pot full of kraut on the other dog. So if you're hungry, I would definitely go here. I had to eat both of my hot dogs (didn't finish them..lol..) with a fork and knife - there is THAT much stuff on them. If you aren't starving, do yourself a favor and order ONE hot dog. Also, if you want to have fries - you can split an order amongst 3 people - they're HUGE. But, size doesn't always equate to quality, and the quality of the dogs is just a little lacking (not much though)."

I agree with other reviews that this joint offers crappy toppings for you to put on, which implies to me that they are not always using top ingredients for these top dollar dogs.\n\nThis is a place for me to say I ate at, but not something I would go to more than once or twice a year max.  The hot dogs come with basic long dogs or a polish dog.  The polish dog is nice and big and tastes pretty good.  I would suggest skipping the \"Chicago Dog\" as it lacks from what a I would call a true Chicago style hot dog.  The Vegas dog was pretty good as was the Majove dog.\n\nOverall an A-OK place to eat a fancy hot dog, but not something you want to eat at often or more than once a year.  Be prepared for a pricey experience with somewhat questionable topping quality."

Pretty much, you walk in and the menu is on the wall one foot ahead of you.  Then one foot to the left, are the cash registers.  Order your food, grab your drink, and find a seat outside on the patio.  \n\nNow, this wouldn't sound too bad in any other city.  But this is Vegas.  If there is any line at all, this means you are waiting outside to order (waiting outside in the 115 degree heat).  Then, when you get your food, you're eating in the 115 degree heat because there isn't any indoor seating.  \n\nI ordered a regular hot dog with sauerkraut added.  It was very mediocre.  My boyfriend and sister ordered the specialty hot dogs.  They said there were just mediocre as well.  At the premium price tag, I was just expecting more.  But there was no difference between these dogs and the hot dogs from Costco.\n\nAdvice: just walk a few more steps and grab a sandwich from Earl of Sandwich instead."

What made the wait seem 10x longer was the fact that the actual place is so small that once about 5 people are inside, the rest of the line is waiting outside in the scorching heat. In a way I was glad that there was a line so that my party and I would have time to browse the menu. I also noticed their had a few special celebrity hot dogs, which certain celebrities conned, obviously. There were hot dogs by Holly Madison and Kim Kardashian, and a few others too. After a few minutes, I decided on the swiss mushroom hot dog, which was a hot dog with swiss cheese, mayo, and of course, mushrooms. My mom got the chili cheese and bacon dog while my dad played it safer with just the chili cheese dog. I must say that I was definitely not impressed with any of the hot dogs we ordered. I am a fan of mayo but the amount of mayo on my hot dog was just way too much for my liking. The mushrooms were almost flavorless and the cheese was not even melted; it was as if it was just placed on top of the hot dog for decoration. Although my parents' chili cheese hot dogs were pretty similar, besides the bacon on my mom's, they were nothing special at all. I think I would have enjoyed a hot dog from Top Dog in Berkeley or even a chili cheese dog from Wienerschnitzel.. would have saved us a few dollars, too. I don't know about ya'll but $7-8 for a hot dog topped with basic kitchen ingredients just doesn't seem right. Maybe the LA location is better? But will I ever know? Nope, because I doubt I'll go outta my way to try another one of their hot dogs."

So when my friends suggested we go there for lunch, I was down!\n\nLuckily we got here right before the huge lunch rush. You can imagine the line getting very long during a busy hour on the LV Strip.\n\n--- Our Order ---\n** Pinks Lemonade (no alcohol) -- It was delicious, GET IT!\n\n** Chili Dog & Chili Cheese Dog -- PASS, the chili is definitely the East Coast style that is mostly just greasy meat/beef. The cheese didn't taste real, must have been some \"Sysco\" cheese matter. This stuff stuck to my ribs and made me want to \"yack\" later that night. My tummy was hurting. The dog was good, I ended up just eating it alone. \n\n** Chili Cheese Fries -- I ate these before the dog and they were mostly good because I was so hungry. Again the chili is just greasy meat, not really the ranch style chili (if that's what you like).\n\nMy biggest complaint about Pink's is that they ONLY have Sysco Ketchup which is very DISGUSTING. It doesn't even taste like tomatoes or ketchup, it just looks like it. On top of that, it's more of a thick paste then a sauce. I seriously wish I could have gotten some Heinz!\n\nThis place got a 1 star bump for my friend's polish with pastrami that I tasted. Although, it was kind of dry and in need of mustard, the flavors were there and it was juicy and hot.\n\nI won't be back here any time soon, but I hope to try the original in Hollywood!"

However, taking a bite of this hot dog, I can honestly say it is one of the best hot dogs I've ever eaten. The flavor of the nacho cheese compliments the dog already, but the mushrooms and bacon bits really elevate the hot dog. For 13 dollars along with a drink, you really can't beat this price for lunch especially in Vegas. There is no line, you get to eat amazing hot dogs, and the price is good. Definitely a must try and a place to stop if you are in Vegas! Plus it is next to the indoor mall!"

Although my first experience here at Pink's wasn't a bad one, I don't think I will be returning.

Practically every time I go to Costco, on my way out I have to buy a hot dog.  I've even purchased their refrigerated hot dogs to make at home - not the same as the ones they make there - I think because of the buns.  But I digress...\n\nI was in Vegas and having heard of Pinks being a southern California favorite, I realized these hot dogs needed to be sampled.  First of all, my challenge was finding the place.  I knew it was inside Planet Hollywood.  Upon walking in, I explored the mall, the food area, and even saw a big sign with an arrow pointing towards the casino/mall exit.  But Pinks was nowhere to be found.  Well, turns out (after asking someone), it is in the front of the casino.  Ahhh.  It was one of those things - most Vegas places on the strip, you never really walk out in front of the casinos.  They are always designed to suck you in and never let you leave.  \n\nAnyway, after finding Pinks I ordered a Chicago dog and their standard footlong dog.  I should note that Pinks has a ton of hot dogs - their menu is quite extensive.  The Chicago dog was much thicker compared to the long and skinny footlong.  Both were ok.  They had been steamed.  Toppings were pretty basic.  No sport peppers on the Chicago dog, which I guess I can't complain about too much because we aren't in Chicago.  Buns were soft and tasted fresh.  \n\nOverall not an amazing hot dog like I had hoped for (still like that Costco hot dogs better), but certainty a very decent dog for Vegas.  Maybe if I make it down to LA someday, I'll try the original."

I had their Polish sausage which came with chili, finely chopped Vidalia onions, and liberal use of American style mustard.  The bun was not particularly substantial, so there was no way to eat the hot dog in the traditional way.  Resorting to using a plastic knife and fork, I took my first bite.  Really?  The Polish sausage was just okay.  The chili was a touch deplorable, and while I enjoyed the sweetness from the onions, I thought the mustard a little too heavy handed.  For similar reasons, my order of chili fries were less than remarkable.  But there was one saving grace.  I tried Natasha's hot dog and thought it was pretty tasty.  Apparently I just failed to order what they are famous for.  The ambience is good though being centrally located on the Strip with plentiful outdoor seating."

While on vacation there were a few places my friends and I had heard about quite often and wanted to check out - Pink's was one of them. Located right in our hotel, we figured it'd be one of the better places to eat during our trip, but ... not so much.\n\nMaybe it's because I've been spoiled by all the good food here in San Francisco, but Pink's didn't strike me as anything special. Most of the items seemed to be pretty similar, mostly consisting of chili, bacon, onions, cheese, and other meats; not a ton of variety overall. Though I have to say, the portions-to-price ratio was pretty good - you get a gigantic, filling meal for about $10 or so, and unless you have a monstrous appetite you won't need a second hot dog.\n\nAs for the food itself? Average. Even though most of my friends and I were feeling ravenous I think only one out of nine of us managed to finish, and it wasn't really because of how filling the hot dogs were. Sure, they're packed to the brim with condiments and other things, but it's mostly standard fare. I actually felt kind of sick and bloated for a few hours afterward, and I certainly didn't feel like finishing the leftovers after looking at it later than day.\n\nUnfortunately for people thinking they'll get to sit indoors and have a hot dog in an AC-dominated environment, the only seating is outdoors in the hot, hot Vegas sun, with only a few tables sitting underneath a bit of shade. It's a pretty small location, so if it's crowded you might just want to bring everything back to your room instead. It'll be less messy that way anyway.\n\nOverall I don't think Pink's met the hype at all. Perhaps because the original is in Los Angeles and not in Vegas, and in addition I've had better hot dogs at local joints (sorry!). It's probably worth a stop if you're in Vegas, but don't go there expecting the best hot dog you've ever had. You'll only set yourself up for disappointment in the end."

Umm it's just hot dogs, put the dog into the bun and add the condiments. Not that hard and not too much to ask for. I will not be going to this establishment ever again. What a pity."

The chili was definitely delicious, so if you're really stuck on going here, grab the chili cheese fries and please save yourself the money and skip the dog. I've never been so adamant on telling someone to skip something as I am about this! The bun was stale, the dog itself was bad- it had that POP when you take your first bite, and though I know that is the goal of some places that serve dogs, I know that's not the goal for pinks and I'm pretty sure it poped because it was way overly old and over cooked. I'm sad to have to give a place with such a great reputation in LA such a bad review, but clearly they sold themselves out when coming to Vegas and just got dollar signs in their eyes without making sure the quality followed with them. I seriously have had MUCH BETTER hot dogs at the movie theater. I couldn't even finish my over-priced hot dog because it was THAT BAD. I know I sound like a snob, but I'm not, i promise. I was hungry after having a long day of walking and beers and all I wanted was a delicious juicy hot dog and this was very disappointing. I keep going on but it was that bad. Good luck to you if you ignore this and still get a dog, I pray I just caught them on a really really off and bad day, but from what I understand, I'm not too far off from what others were saying.Sorry friends!"

It's there people's, but it's located on the outside corner of Planet Hollywood\n\nPros: \n-Pinks's was Vegas out,,,,Super bright pink signs\n-Didn't even have to wait in line\n-Quick food for Vegas\n- Yummy bacon\n-Order of fries is automatically seasoned, yumo!\n\nCons:\n-It's too hot to eat outside in Vegas during summer, we took our food into the Planet Hollywood Mall and ate at the tables near Fat Tuesday's\n-Canned mushrooms\n-Didn't like the taste of the polish dog here \n-Scaled down menu from the original\n\n***So I still haven't found the right DOG for me at Pink's LA or LV, but I'd definitely give it a another shot**\n\nBUT HONESTLY....I STILL LOVE MY SF MISSION BACON WRAPPED HOTDOGS (with grilled onions from the carts)  AND COSTCO HOTDOGS (super duper cheap) WAY BETTER."

            "review": "For lunch I wanted to try Pink's--finally.  I heard that their hot dogs were very good and decided to try for myself.  There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Pink's--size and cost. I'll explain in a minute.\n\nJust to let everyone know, Pink's it outside of Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile Shops facing the boulevard.  I walked around for awhile till I found the sign in the building and realized it was outside.  Anyway, there wasn't a line and their seating is all outside, so I went in to take a look at their menu.\n\nThe menu is simple with pre-made options for you and even burgers if you aren't into their dogs. At almost 10 dollars a dog it was pretty pricey, but I expected that from a famous hot dog eaterie.  They even have their special dogs from celebrities on a flyer at the entrance and near the menu, so check those out, too.\n\nI went for a guadalajara dog--sour cream, tomatoes, onions and relish--and my husband ate their classic chili dog with onions.  We grabbed a water and fountain drink for a total of 25 dollars and moved on down to the pick up area. When I saw our hot dogs I freaked out.  I love toppings, but really?  REALLY?  This was definitely a fork and knife dog.\n\nI love eating my hot dogs by hand.  It's just the way that it should be, but at Pink's it's difficult to do so.  Too many toppings on the dog cause the flavor of the dog to be lost, so I scraped EVERYTHING off on one half to get down to what matters--that fried dog.  The hot dog is good with a slight snap to it, but it's not an amazing.  I ate the rest with my utensils, feeling as if I violated some ethical hot dog code by not eating with my hands.\n\nIf you want to try the dog, buy a plain one and ask for toppings on the side if you need them, that way you can really taste what a Pink's dog is all about.  If you want something really good, their chili dog was decent.\n\nOverall the dog was decent and I can at least say that I've tried it once. Would I fight my way down there through traffic again for it?  Nope.  But it's something you have to try once so you can say that you have."

I have to admit, Pink's wasn't one of my first choices, but after seeing how long the line was at Earl's, I knew Pink's was the next best option. The menu is extensive and it will probably take you a while to decide. but it helps that the employees are friendly, knowledgeable, and patient which is always a plus! We ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 1 Mushroom Swiss Dog, and 1 Showgirl Dog plus a side of fries and a drink. Our total was around $40.\n\nThe Showgirl Dog (relish, onions, bacon, chopped tomato, sauerkraut, and sour cream) - Amazing! If you love bacon, I promise you that this is the hotdog for you because it is loaded with strips of crispy, yummy bacon! The only thing I would change about the hotdog is the bun - it wasn't very good and tasted like a hotdog bun from Safeway. Other than that, I would TOTALLY recommend this to anyone.\n\nFrench Fries - Possibly the best french fries I've had and that is a big statement! Pink's Fries tasted like they were dipped in batter right before they were fried and the insides were so perfectly piping hot, which made for a crispy, yet soft fry. Very good!\n\nI didn't get to try the cheeseburgers or the Mushroom Swiss Dog, but my family said that they enjoyed their meals. If I'm ever in the area, I will definitely stop by Pink's.. but with a Fat Tuesday next time!"

He enjoyed it \nI ordered the polish dog which had chili and grilled onions. It was good but nothing too special, I guess I should have ordered one of their specialties.\nWe also ordered the onion rings which were yummmy! Greasy and big! =P\nNot bad, but not great. I guess I'll give it another try, but at the LA location instead. I wouldn't go back to the Las Vegas location though, because of where it's located and the fact that the price is higher than the LA location."

At a moderate price, they are great for lunch, and there is no selection of toppings (all a bit expensive add ons, but tasty none the less).

Probably not, considering it's just a hotdog. It's basically like paying $2 for the hotdog and $4 for the famous name. And if it's not even the original Hollywood stand, what's the point? Definition of a tourist trap. \n\nI suppose I would recommend everyone to try it once, and don't try to be healthy. Lather on the sour cream, cheese, chili, ect because if you're going to wait an obscene amount of time for a $6-$8 hot dog, you might as well go all out. It might help if you were a little tipsy as well to cushion the realization of the resources you are exhausting for minimal nutritional value. Hey, it's Vegas. Luckily for myself, I barely beat the lunch rush, was able to walk up and order, and got my dog in just a few minutes. But the line a few minutes later was crazy! Unfortunately for me though, it was also December and freezing outside. None of your $6 goes toward any indoor seating. \n\nI've always believed Las Vegas embodies the best and worst things about America, all in one place. Such as greasy, overpriced \"famous\" food.

The wait was not long at all such a plus especially when we are acting and feeling like we haven't eaten for days. We grabbed a seat on their patio outside, great view. The Bellagio and Cosmo are across the street so the view was beautiful. If you're lucky you can see the water show. Took my first bite and the dog was skinny.. I was expecting something meatier I guess? Tasted like a typical chili cheese dog with jalape\u00f1os. No wow just a hotdog with accessories. I was fairly disappointed but i definitely still ate it, it's still a hotdog! Haha We looked at each other after we finished and laughed saying \"I could definitely eat another one\" the man who said one would be enough wasn't! We didn't get another because it was mediocre and it was almost $8 a hotdog. Overall my experience was good but the quality, taste and price.. Very disappointing."

The hog dog itself was alright, and it did have a bit of the \"snap\" that other reviewers mention, but the hot dog bun was definitely a letdown. It was cold and basically tastes like something you get out of a bag from the grocery store that's been sitting around maybe a few days too long--it's edible but just doesn't add anything at all to the hot dog. My friend had a few too many drinks, and even he knew better than to eat the bun, instead eating his hog dog and toppings with a fork and knife. \n\nOverall, it's a decent meal if you want to spend three times as much on a hot dog as you should, but IMO, Pink's is nothing to get excited about. I'd just as soon pick up a hot dog at Ikea and probably give it the same star rating. In Vegas, though, you're better off popping inside and paying the same amount (or less, in some cases) for an awesome sandwich from Earl's."

We fell asleep & Next thing I know I wake up at 3am puking my brains out. Then the runs kicked in, then the body aches. This lasted for close to 24 hours causing us to extend our stay. Obviously, she lucked out and I got food poisoning. Apparently Pinks is known for this because a fellow guest at planet Hollywood said the same thing happened to his buddy the night before and someone else told him that place is bad news afterwards.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! Not worth getting sick over. It's brutal."

It's just like the Tommy's chili, which is totally tasty. None of this fancy beans with veggies crap. Just pure slop looking chili, just the way it should be when atop a stack of fries of hot dog and cheese.\n\nGrilled onions and mushrooms are done just right for all the combinations. The Las Vegas dog is now my new favorite. Be WARE they load the hot dogs. This is no cheesy Weinerschnitzel or Sonics dog. One dog and sharing fries, will make you plenty full.\n\nMUST TRY: Chili Cheese fries"

I can't even remember which dogs we ordered but it was all just ok not as great as I thought it would be. My dog consisted of two dogs with guacamole, nacho cheese, and onions. My fiance's was jalapenos, nacho cheese, guac, and tomato,  threw in some chili cheese fries too. I also ordered an alcoholic drink lemonade slushy but it was just filling and not strong at all. So the reason I will never forget this place is because we stopped here before we made our way back home to Riverside. As soon as we hit the road my tummy started growling and hurting alot. We reached a rest stop on the 15 fwy and I ran as fast as I could and then all hell broke loose! I'd never experienced anything like it. I felt so weak after and we had such a long way to go, do you know how scary it was to drive for hours and not know when the next restroom stop would come. We bought lots of pepto bismol and thankfully no accidents occurred lol. I know this story is really embarrassing but I just want to warn others , stock up on some pepto and if you do eat here don't do it before a 4 hour drive home hahaha."

By all appearances, it was just an unremarkable Thursday night.  \n\nSo off to Planet Hollywood we went.  But when we pulled up to Valet Parking behind three stretch limos, and no valet was in sight, something seemed off.  Then I saw that we were about six blocks from the valet stand, again with no valet in view.  So, off to self-parking we went, with uniformed police everywhere, to find a parking spot.  At length we found one--the only one.  Something unusual was definitely going on.\n\nSo, Diane and I walked from the parking garage into the Miracle Mile shops, and walked and walked.  As we finally reached the entrance to Planet Hollywood on the other side of the shopping promenade, 9 uniformed sheriff's deputies were assembled together, and fashionably suited males and well-dressed females were everywhere.  About then I realized that we had left the Groupon in the car.  Oh, well (sigh).  I decided that I wasn't going to walk all the way back and return again just to save a mere $5!  So, we continued on and out the main doors until we finally saw Pink's facing Las Vegas Boulevard, and examined the vast menu on the wall before making our selections.\n\nThis story does end well.  I really enjoyed my Brooklyn Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog with pickles, onions, mustard, and sauerkraut added, on a soft Old Country bun.  It included a generous amount of tender pastrami, and although the hot dog was thin, it was long and had a very nice snap to it when one bit into the casing.  Beer-battered Onion Rings and nicely salted Shoestring Fries were both good and tasty.  And I liked the mild Nacho Cheese Sauce for dipping my Fries, while Diane enjoyed Mini Corn Dogs.  To my surprise, one single hot dog sufficed to quell my appetite.  And, there were free refills of lemonade and all other available soft drinks.  \n\nThe place is nothing fancy, seating is all outside, and there is only counter service.  But staff members were friendly and helpful.  We had a nice view of the Strip before us, but it was a mite cold and windy at 10:47 p.m.  Heat lamps were present, but not in service.  Hard driving music overhead added to the casual ambiance.  So, we finished our food, walked all the way back to the car, and left the parking lot as we were directed out by at least 6 police officers.  Just as we were turning onto Tropicana Avenue, Diane asked the last officer if she knew what was going on at Planet Hollywood, and was told, \"Soul Train Awards!\"\n\nNow I'm sort of glad that I still have my Groupon for Pink's, which, as luck would have it, does not really expire for another month.  For, it means that I can return again soon to enjoy another tasty classic dog!"

The menu seems to be a lot bigger. I thought I got a pretty good hot dog topped with so much fatty goodness, and my friends seemed to have tasty ones too.

I ordered the Planet Hollywood dog which is a polish sausage in a bun with grilled onions, grilled mushroom, bacon, and nacho cheese.  The onions and mushrooms were scarce and barely grilled. The nacho cheese was just the normal nacho cheese you get anywhere else.  There were about 5 strips of crispy bacon, but that didn't seem to justify the price of $8.99.  The sausage wasn't even particularly amazing either.  \n\nI also didn't like how cramped the doorway and overall space was.  Only two parties can stand in line before people must wait outside in the 100+ degree weather.  While the seating area did have fans, they were so powerful that they were more bothersome than pleasant - my napkins kept flying away and my hair flew in my face!\n\nI'm glad I checked it off of my places to try, but I wouldn't go back again.

I don't know about what others think, but I thought the guac didn't have enough avocado in it for me to taste.

I settled on a regular traditional dog with cheese, bacon, chili, tomato, onion, mustard and ketchup. I also had them add guacamole for an extra charge.\n\nIt was so large, I had to use a fork to eat it, in fear of getting it all over my face (therefore messing up my makeup job. We can't have that). The Corona I ordered was expensive ($5), but complimented my dog perfectly and was well-worth it.\n\nOne of the guys I was with ordered Bacon Burrito Dog..... Let me start off with a warning. This thing has around five or six hot dogs in it. You might want to abstain from eating for at least two days prior when planning to tackle this thing.\n\nOverall, the joint is really pricy. My total bill with the dog and beer came to around $15. Not an amount I would be willing to pay normally, but it was my first time so I decided to throw caution (and my wallet) to the wind.

This time around, I ordered a couple to split with friends-\n\n-Nacho Cheese Chili Dog (Nacho Cheese, Chili, Mustard & Onions $7.29): The nacho cheese and onions were good, but there was too much chili and it overwhelmed the taste of the hot dog. However, it did have that nice snap that Pink's is known for.\n-The Spicy Mojave Dog (Polish Sausage, Nacho Cheese, Jalape\u00f1os, Grilled Onions, Guacamole & Tomatoes $8.49): I didn't like the polish sausage from here very much since I thought it was too salty.

I've only been here twice and I can't seem to recall what I ordered on my first visit but I can say that the hot dogs are really good and they definitely put a lot of thought into the different combinations. \n\n& as a fan of chili cheese fries, how could I pass on the deluxe chili cheese fries for a good portion of my wallet (costs the same if not more than a hot dog).

They not only have regular dogs, but they have specialty dogs as well with everything imaginable on top.\n\nFirst...the entrance to Pinks is from the sidewalk on the strip.  I was parked in the back parking garage, so coming from the backside of the Miracle Mile, I was lost.  I thought Pinks was inside or would have an entrance from the inside.  They do not.  I walked around for about 20 min. trying to find it before I realized it was outside.\n\nLooking over the menu I just didn't want to have an old fashioned hot dog, I wanted to try one of their special dogs.  I ordered up a Planet Hollywood dog, which is a polish sausage with cheese sauce, mushrooms, grilled onions and bacon.  They have a list of other dogs as well for anything you are craving.  My order arrived and I was ready to eat.  \n\nWell...it was an experience that's for sure!  Trying to eat this huge dog with all the toppings gave a new meaning to messy!

There has to have been SOME saving grace, right?\n\nUnless there's major shenanigans that have to be called out (such as with www.yelp.com/biz/ted-wiens-tire-and-auto-centers-las-vegas-3#hrid:Ng0bUo3nQ2adWG5GHmy3MA/query:ted%20wiens ) It's been all roses and chocolate-covered corpses. \n\nThen there's this wanna-be Pink's. \nFirst off, putting Pink's in a swank hotel-casino is strike one. Pink's should be nasty, grimy, eat outside on the picnic tables and feed the obese birds. Pink's is park across the street several blocks down because you risk instant cardiac arrest if you don't walk it off. Pink's is People. \n\nSecondly, what's with the pseudo-exclusivity? Like the other reviewers on here have said, there's a waiting list and they're not consistent. I mean, if I wanted to wait in line I'd go to a club, aight? All I want is diabetes, goddamnit. Make it snappy. Do I need proper security clearances to stuff my face?\n\nHaving practically been raised (i.e. \"Dude, first PINK's then Necromance!\") on the \"chorizo-double-burger-chilli-ham-sausage-kielbasa-plane-crash-survivor MEGA HELLA FKN MEAAAAT!\" standards of the ORIGINAL Pink's on Melrose, this is beyond weak. \n\nThis is Freddie Prinze Jr. doing Macbeth.

Quite possibly the only time those two will ever be #1 and #2 on the same list.  For anything.  Ever.\n\nUnlike Earl of Sandwich, which had its usual, ridiculous line going on, nary a person could be found at the at counter at Pink's.  Perfect for us since we just wanted a quick lunch before our flight...and because we probably took 10 minutes to figure out what to get from their giant menu board (it took me so long, I swear they all started to sound the same...).  Although it wasn't one of the sexier options, I ordered the POLISH PASTRAMI SWISS CHEESE DOG ($8.49), and tried some for the CHILI CHEESE FRIES ($6.79) that my friend had ordered for our group to share.  \n\nTopped with Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, and Mustard (forgot to add on the Sour Kraut), the polish wasn't bad but hardly exciting (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#2Cd3mM114U75Fre4_Z9ong).  While the Polish sausage itself was fine (who knew it went so well with Swiss cheese?), the shreds of pastrami were really dry and a bit salty.  The Chili Cheese Fries were guiltfully tasty though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#ZCy7uTuIMph17rZSk5TtgA).  Not so much for the cheese sauce (because it's, you know, cheese sauce), but because their chili is surprisingly decent!  Plus...who doesn't love some good chili fries?\n\nAll in all, I'd come back if I needed something relatively quick and simple, as well as to try some of the more unique and \"exotic\" combinations (stomach ache on a plane?  Ummm...no).  Pink's is probably one of the better bets around based on convenience alone, but at about $8 a pop, they do an even better job of making me appreciate Costco's $1.50 Polish and a drink that much more."

The dogs are filling, they're good, and since I have never been to LA I cant compare them to the original.  Its a fun thing to splurge on when your in vegas."

We ate the Planet Hollywood Dog, which had the potential to be a super guilty, but worth-it experience, but it was just that - standard ingredients of a polish sausage with grilled onions, mushrooms, and bacon with nacho cheese. You can probably just load it up like that at home and make it just as good, or better. Maybe I was just expecting more with the hype."

I was at Pink's this weekend in Vegas and decided to eat here with some friends. I knew how great the hot dogs are, so I tried it. I got the mushroom swiss. The hot dog was long but skinny. To my surprise the hot dog tasted OK, but it was made in less than a minute after I ordered it. In conclusion, the hot dog was NOT made to order as it was already pre-made. The hot dog was not hot but warm. Also, they charge $2.95 for a fountain drink which is not listed on the menu. What a great way to rip people off... all in all I spent over $10 on a hot dog and a fountain drink. Way overpriced! I know they need to pay for their rent but this is ridiculous! I will never come back to Pink's in Las Vegas. I will try Pink's in LA when I visit... hopefully it's a lot better than the LV location."

When we jumped in line, there were only 10 other people in front of us but it took nearly 30 minutes just to get up to the counter to order. This place is freakin' slow! While we were waiting in line for 30 minutes the line grew to epic proportions... easily like 50+ people behind us in line. I hate to think what they had to wait at the end just to order.\n\nI ended up ordering a chili cheese dog with a side of fries (it only took me 45 seconds from pulling up to the counter to order to leaving the line and not the average of 3 minutes to order per person. It isn't that hard.). The chili cheese dog was good... slightly above average for a hot dog. \n\nThe problem with Pink's is the wait time to order to taste ratio. Its good to try once but it definitely isn't worth the wait. The second thing is the seating area outside is very very small. If you come at a busy time, you might have to hover until you find a place to sit. It didn't happen with me, but I can see it happening."

From service, to the final product, I was beyond disappointed, especially when compared to their other, much more busy LA location. I was the hungry, and the only one in line, and ordered 5 hotdogs and 1 fry, one chile, and 4 \"Chicago style\". I paid, and stood to wait for my for my dogs to be prepared, 4 or 5 people beyond the line chit chatting, laughing, totally ignoring me and my food. About 10 minutes later, one of the 5 workers starting half hazardously started throwing the extremely expensive hot dogs together in a painfully slow fashion all the while still chitchatting with his other co-workers, not giving another care in the world, let alone me, the customer. \nNow to the consumption of the dogs. I've eaten probably a 1000 dogs in my lifetime, all over the world, many I would say were pretty bad- these I would say were horrible. The bun to dog ratio were way off, which would not be bad, if the bun were steamed and not cool and on the border of being stale. I ate the chile dog first, which made the bun bearable. The second dog, which was there interpretation of the \"Chicago style\", who's toppings were way beyond ice cold- unbearably cold. So cold, the actual hotdog was cold why the time I got to it (above room temp), and extremely inedible, especially combined with the large stale bun. I wasn't the only one who felt this way, either. Since I paid, the other two in my party just politely didn't finished their food (just a single hotdog) without a peep, both starving before we got there.  \nPinks, don't go opening restaurants in hopes they become tourist traps, because I moved to Las Vegas last month, and my second day here, I was trapped by this restaurant thinking it was the same quality as the one in LA. I'm a local who could have been repeat business for you. My husband works right there, and the disgusting service (that I only scratched the surface on) and food you proved is enough for him to steer everyone clear.

My other friend (a newyorker) and I thought it was good but agreed it wasn't awesome.

I have a feeling the dog had better snap to it before it got doused in the chili.   \n\nThat being said, I did enjoy my experience there.  It was exactly what I was looking for at that moment.  We were buzzed and looking to eat something extremely unhealthy but tasty - and that's exactly what we got.\n\nI'd definitely try it again because for some reason, I think it was just an off night.  And we had some strange concoction of drinks before going there so all of this might be completely in my head."

The patio seating is cool a place to eat your dog and people watch on LV Blvd."

            "review": "Finally got to try this place.\n\nVerdict: hot dogs were as plain as you can get, tasted just like a plain ol' Nathan's hot dog. I got the Vegas strip dog which had two hot dogs in one bun + mustard + ketchup + chili + cheese + guacamole + jalape\u00f1os. Basically they serve a plain hot dogs with various junk you can add on top. \n\nThe fries were really good though. Perfect level of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.\n\nOne other downside is that this place only has an outdoor patio for seating."

            "review": "Never been to the original one in L.A., so this is my first time ever. I forgot the name of the hotdog that I ordered but it had onions, tomato, bacon, and mustard. The hot dog was pretty good. Toppings were great. The onions and tomatoes were fresh. The bacon was crispy but not burnt. The hotdog was also cooked well. Love how it snapped with each bite. BUT, the hotdog by itself is ok. In my opinion, if the hotdog can stand alone without the toppings, then I'd be wow'd. However, since I've only tried one hotdog on the menu, I'll be sure to be back. Hopefully, the next time I eat a pink's hotdog, it'll be at the original one in L.A."

The bun was like the cheap kind you can buy at any grocery store- the kind that always seems to be just at the tipping point of turning stale. The actual hot dog wasn't anything special.  But the worse part was the copious amounts of lukewarm chili piled atop the hot dog.  My sister and I ended up eating just half and throwing the rest away. Overall, a pretty sad experience :("
