One of the entrees was cold when served. Servers were slow and didn't even know basic serving etiquette. Far better choices in Vegas."

The service was prompt and the waiter was more than patient as my 2 guys friends and I chatted it up like old New Jersey girlfriends. We got the chicken wrapped in Prosciutto, the Fillet and the Osso Bucco and we were pleased with everything. Perhaps the greatest part of Sinatra though is the bathroom, which has toothbrushes and toothpaste. So if you find yourself alone and destitute in Vegas, as so many of us do, drag your behind to the Sinatra bathroom, it's my favorite bathroom in Vegas."

The bone-in veal is one of the best bites of beat I've ever had. I do wish the crusted had been crispy. \n\nAlso kudos for having lower-priced, non-alcoholic versions of their cocktails. More bars need to recognize. \n\nDid I mention the Wynn Hotel and Encore are both gorgeous?"

            "review": "Definitely 5 stars. My review here is of the vegan menu at Sinatra. However, I should note that many dishes on the vegan menu are also found on the regular menu with slight alterations so I'm assuming taste and quality wise, we're all on the same page. \n\nWhen Chef Theo Schoenegger was given the task of creating a vegan menu, he didn't choose to treat that as a chore and create a menu chock full of salads and dishes a 2 year old could whip up. He obviously rose to the challenge and created a passionate menu with hearty vegan dishes. \n\nAs a vegetarian, I avoid vegan entrees at Italian restaurants as I'm not a fan of vegan cheese and cream-less soups/pastas. Sinatra really wowed me with what they created within these boundaries. \n\nThe vegan menu here is astonishing. There are 3 starters (a Caesar salad, a beet salad and a butternut squash soup). 2 pasta dishes and 3 main courses and 3 desserts. Some dishes use Gardein protein.\n\n We ordered the soup to share. A smooth, creamy (?) soup with a kick in it. Marinating in the soup were vegan ricotta cheese dumplings. Neither me nor my husband are fans of butternut squash but this soup hit the ball out of the park. \n\nFor our second course (yes we did the Italian thing and had pasta and a main), we each ordered a pasta dish. My husband ordered the vegan ricotta cheese dumplings in an asparagus cream sauce. Divine. I didn't even realize the cheese was vegan. The asparagus cream sauce was light yet robust in flavors and when scooped up with the dumpling, it was the perfect explosion in my mouth. I ordered the Pennette. This is also on the regular menu. Tomato sauce and penne mixed with sweet peppers onions and Gardien Sausage. Yes....talk about comfort in a bowl. The generous helping was delicious and was definitely what I expected (if not better!). \n\nFor our main, we shared a \"Chicken\" Marsala. A Gardein chicken breast that was baked and spiced was the main attraction on the plate. On top of it was a creamy, woody, mushroom (oyster) sauce that covered the chicken. Surrounding the \"chicken\" were billowy gnocchi that were smooth, simple and complemented the bold flavors of the sauce and chicken. Considering I've never had the opportunity to have a Marsala sauce since it's usually served with chicken, I take this first taste as being an exquisite experience. \n\nFor the finale to the meal, we shared a Campari and citrus sorbet. Presented beautifully, it was a light ending to a perfect meal.\n\nI don't really have to elaborate much about the ambiance and the service. This is the Encore and there was perfection executed all over. My favorite Italian experience thus far, has been at Aranciata Blu in Rome. Sinatra came so close to that experience that it was scary. I never thought I could enjoy such an ethereal experience just 20 minutes away from home.  \n\nVegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore or whatever palate you have, Sinatra is a well worth-it experience. Oh, and the wine list here is also very impressive. \n\nSinatra...keep yourself Just The Way You Are...."

            "review": "Elegant restaurant, classy and beautifully dressed. Delicious cuisine and excellent service. \n\nStarters\nProsciutto with melon: Perfect starter. \nBeets, citrus segments, fried goat cheese, pistachios - beets were super fresh and an excellent spring starter.\nTuna carpaccio was fresh and flavorful, well-paired with pickled vegetables, pine nuts, raisins, in a balsamic reduction.\n\nMains\nBranzino - phenomenal. Potentially best branzino I've ever had. Came highly recommended from our server, justified.\nCioppino - hearty seafood stew of lobster, clams, scallops, shrimp, couscous in tomato lobster broth. Friend enjoyed this dish.\n\nService was good after initial hiccups. We requested to be reseated from a long table to a round table to allow for better conversation, which was accommodated but took awhile to reseat us. Fortunately, our server Dinah got our party of 8 ladies out in time for 7pm La Reve. Would recommend for special occasions - prefer Sinatra to Circo at Bellagio."

            "review": "Since I'm Yelping everything else I went to in Vegas, why not include Sinatra? \nWe went last night. They had a nice table for us for two right by the window. Nice. Waiter was friendly and answered any and all questions. \nThe starter salads were amazing. I had a hearts of romaine salad with gorgonzola, walnuts and grapes. The dressing of olive oil and vinegar was perfect, not too strong and not too light. One of the better salads I've had.\nSince I've been eating a lot of cow in Vegas I decided on something different here. I had the Lobster Risotto. It was very very good. Normally risotto is topped off with a few bits of lobster (if it's Lobster Risotto obviously). Not here. I had a full half of a lobster with both claws on the risotto. Mixed into the lemony, creamy, peppery risotto with peas it was divine. Add in a nice white wine (a chardonnay if you must know) and it was a stellar meal.\nI was a bit surprised, honestly, because based on the other reviews I thought it might just be another overpriced Vegas restaurant. From my experience though, and I have had more than a few world class meals, this is an excellent dining experience that should satisfy the pickiest of diners. \nApparently Steve Wynn was buddies with Old Blue Eyes, hence the name of the place. That's a nice tribute and it makes your dining that much more enjoyable if you're a Frank fan (which frankly I'm not but can appreciate the tunes). Enjoy. Oh, one last thing - take out that second mortgage before coming here, it will come in handy. That is also true for most other restaurants in popular places in Vegas though, so no direct criticism here - it would be nice if restaurants lowered prices somewhat to meet the bleakness of the economy but most must still be getting the prices they're asking for, so pony up or go to In-N-Out instead."

            "review": "I reserved the Sinatra for a work dinner about a month before CES, and if I were paying for the meal out of my own pocket it would have been pretty disappointing. I had one of two vegetarian options: a butternut squash pasta pocket (there's a better Italian word for this) in a brown butter and sage sauce. The sauce was completely flavorless, unfortunately. Butter + sage should make me want to lick the plate, especially at $30 a plate; this made me bored and still hungry. The wine selections, breads, and the \"skinny\" panna cotta were pretty good, though. Classy service redeemed the food a bit -- turns out I like my chair being pulled out for me -- and the ambiance is charming, with Sinatra films playing in the bar."

            "review": "Like one of the reviewers we went to Sinatra's for a special event, our wedding anniversary. I had researched restaurants and Sinatra's came highly to us.  My mom came with us to celebrate her birthday.\n\nWe were greeted and given a handwritten card wishing us Happy Anniversary.  Everyone is right when they say the surroundings are elegant and Frank's music serenades you.  My mom and I had decided to split the butternut squash ravioli.  We had been out at several restaurants where the servings had been large so we thought it would be a great way to try a dish and save room for dessert.  \n\nOur waiter was not personable and fairly aloof. He didn't make suggestions on food or wine and just shortly answered our questions.  Like a previous reviewer, we felt overlooked.  The restaurant was not busy for a Monday night and we observed three managers moving among the tables.  Not one came over to greet us or ask how we were.  I ordered a glass of wine and Pasta Fagoli soup which I would describe as watery broth with beans, tomatoes and pasta. Just not much taste to it.\n\nWe received our main entrees and I looked down to see that our split meal consisted of about 4-5 small ravioli for myself and my mom. I mean they were small.  My husband's lobster risotto tasted great and he shared with us. The ravioli was average and nothing to write home about.\n\nNot once did our waiter return to ask how our meal was or if I wanted another glass of wine.  I'm not one to complain but I know when people take a genuine interest in you being in there restaurant.\n\nOur dirty dishes sat in front of us for over 20 minutes as various staff walked by. We finally stopped someone to remove our plates.  Our waiter showed more interest in the large table nearby and finally came over to ask about dessert.\n\nI wasn't asking for a free dessert for our anniversary but like another reviewer said, we had eaten at Botero (another Encore restaurant) and had received better service plus a cute dessert for our anniversary.\n\nOur tiramisu at Sinatra's was good and standard.  Nothing extraordinary.  Our waiter never came over again to inquire if we wanted anything else.  I was mostly sad as I had wanted a special night for us.  A little warmth and personality goes a long way towards good customer services.  With being laid off recently, I could have spent more, but $200 for a mediocre evening was not what I had envisioned."

Therefore you may want to couple good food with atmosphere and Sinatra has great atmosphere and amenities.  From the generous leather backed chairs to the decorator tableclothes and polished cotton napkins the place makes you feel comfortable.  \n\nThe sommelier was polite and helpful and the wait staff very attentive.  The highlights of the meal included fabulous Osso Busco, carparccio, and Branzino.  \n\nCould write more - but no need - as this place is no brainer - especially for those staying at the Encore or Wynn.\n\nTrust me you will be happy."

The look and feel, the music, the people, the food--the memories.\n\nAfter a couple of drinks amongst the group and appetizers of carpaccio and then a great house made truffle noodle dish that was OUTSTANDING, we enjoyed a great meal.  Plates included lamb chops, Oso Buco, Agnolotti--home made herb infused pasta, filet with asparagus, salmon, and the pork chop special.\n\nDuring dinner, we reminisced about Sinatra and Sinatra Jr--and their friends and family.  You can just feel the presence, frankly.\n\nThe wait staff and entire team are marvelous as usual--as this is likely out 10th visit to the restaurant. When in Vegas, don't miss Sinatra, particularly if you are a fan of a great vibe and incredible food."

The music was nice, the place is elegant, classic, and intimate. \n\n     We had our team dinner here, 12 of us, everyone was hungry and we ordered just about everything on the menu.\n\n- Caprese mozzarella di bufala, heirloom tomatoes, red onion, basil - classic and good.\n\n- Prosciutto - Parma prosciutto, caramelized Bartlett pears, Parmigiana Reggiano - nice presentation.\n\n- Polpettine housemade meatballs, polenta fries - this was good.\n\n- Insalatina dell' Imperatore n\"Caesar Salad\" anchovy, Parmesan crisp - such a smal portion, and I don't even like big portion, but this was meh.\n\n- Lasagna Bolognese - fresh pasta layered with veal, pork and beef rag\u00fa - this was tasty.\n\n- Risotto with lobster - this was quite nice and perfectly creamy. \n\n- Veal Parmigiana thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce - this was an impressive side, gigantic, but it wasn't that tasty as I was hoping for. \n\n- The Rib Eye - we ordered medium rare, it was medium. The second order came out was over cooked again, disappointed. \n\n      The wine list was dominantly Italian, very reasonable, good selection of Chianti, Barolo, Barbaresco, and Super Tuscan. Our sommelier did an amazing job to get us our wines the Nebbiolo and Barbaresco. \n\n       Our server was so busy with other table that we had to flag him down a few times. I understand that it was CES 2014, but still as a caliber of this restaurant, we expect a higher par."

Note to self - don't listen to her again!\n\nEasiest way to put it, it wasn't bad Italian, but I've had exponentially better. I was disappointed by the lack of flavor in the dishes for such a high end restaurant, and prices that match said style.\n\nWe'd been looking at Yelp all day during the tradeshow, in excitement of our upcoming dinner here. I absolutely loved the memorabilia used as decor. I think I was born in the wrong decade ;)\n\nWe had to wait to be seated until all of us arrived, then we were whisked into the dining area -- where for high end, they stack people on top of people. It was very dim lit, so much the table behind us was using their iPhone flashlights s to look at the menu and they had to be in their 40s, not even that old!\n\nWe were all hungry, since we made an 8PM reservation. Luckily they set down two large portions of different breads, bread sticks, and some crispy cheese things for us all to share. Oh and duh, they offered butter to spread, as well as hummus too. We devoured both bowls of options!\n\nFor starters, we knew we wanted to share lasagna as an appetizer and also try something else to share with our large group. However, after ordering our server came back and told us they only had one left -- 3 had been ordered in our group. It ended up going to one of my co-workers and I was left to re-order (rude)!\n\nInstead, she brought out a Pennette -- Italian sausage rag\u00f9, bell peppers,\nonions, tomato, fresh basil. to share. We also ordered 2 orders of the Polpettine -- housemade meatballs, polenta fries. The sausage in the Pennette had lots of flavor, the sauce and the other stuff was nothing to even write about, bland for the most part. Some raved about the meatballs, but again I didn't think they were that great and didn't have any robust flavor to them.\n\nWe did order a bottle of Chianti and the Somm came over and assisted in doing so. She was polite and served the table the first bottle. She also came back shortly after and brought us a second bottle. I'm not a huge Chianti fan, but after it aerated it tasted better. Again, I'm a simpleton when it comes to wine, not fancy or boughie at all.\n\nSince I had to change my order, I went with the Veal Parmigiana* -- thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce. I also asked for a side of Spaghetti, which was easily accommodated, but they don't put it on the menu. It was good, but I'm still not sure how I feel about eating 'veal'. I'd prefer chicken, bu they don't offer that. They did have a special that night with truffles, but I thought I better not order a $115 appetizer or $195 entree on the company tab. My veal was HUGE and it tasted good, but nothing amazing. Again, the pomodoro sauce left something to be desired.\n\nI know others enjoyed their food, but I don't think anyone was raving about their entrees. \n\nOur server was great, as you'd expect from a higher end restaurant. She was attentive and also detail oriented. She felt bad about the lasagna and tried her best to make it work for our group.\n\nWe didn't order dessert because everyone was pretty stuffed at this point and nothing seemed to peek our interest.\n\nOverall, it was a lackluster dinner for Vegas. The namesake draws you in, but the execution is lacking severely. If you've had good Italian food, then you'd know they are not on par here.\n\nGo some where else in Vegas, ANY WHERE else!"

I ordered the blue crab salad over tomato, cucumber and croutons. The amount of blue crab that they placed on the salad was amazing! The crab was light and sweet but not overpowered by the dressing. I also had a veal, beef and pork meatball with fried pancetta. Meatball was so moist and and cooked to perfection. A basket of various bread was also brought to our table.

Once (also in a good way) when I saw the bathrooms (haha, they've got some nice bathrooms in there).  And the third time (in a bad, but appreciative way) when we got the check.\n\nWas it expensive? HELL YES\nWas it worth every penny? HELL YES\nWill I go back? Certainly, after I gather a few more paychecks.\n\nI had the Polpettine appetizer (meatballs with polenta fries).  It was 4 tiny meatballs that were ok.  Save your money and don't order this one!\n\nOrdered the Ossobuco \"My Way\" which is the house specialty.  It is a braised veal served with risotto.  This was AMAZING!!!\n\nOrdered something for dessert.  Don't remember what it was.  It was pretty good, from what I remember.\n\nBut the Ossobuco totally stole the show and overshadowed everything else about the meal.\n\nThe bill for 6 of us was well over $600, so it ain't cheap.\n\nService was exceptional.\n\nReservations are recommended.  There is a dress code.  The place is a very classy, so please don't throw on your Ed Hardy dragon t-shirt and your way too tight True Religion jeans and think you'll be ok.  You will definitely stick out like a sore douche.  Slacks and a button down collared shirt is good enough."

It wasn't as good as the first, mostly because of the mediocre service.\n\nThe food was classic Italian, meaning the chicken parm was really really good, light crispy batter, perfectly cooked chicken, really nice sauce. My steak was above average. However, my side of eggplant was swimming in grease and tasteless. They fussed over us until we ordered, and then we were ignored. No one ever came to the table to ask if we were satisfied, and no one noticed that I only took a bite or two of it. That felt less than 4 star.\n\nBottom line, it's a Vegas upscale hotel restaurant. They don't have a famous chef, so they better deliver on service. It didn't happen."

We opted to sit outside as it was a beautiful evening and pretty much had the whole patio to ourselves for almost our whole meal. There are just 6 tables outside in the garden area and there are heaters and a firepit/fireplace that help to keep the chill off. \n\nFor starters we had the Polpettini ..(the housemade meatballs with polenta fries) and the Panzanella con Granchio ... (jumbo lump blue crab, brioche croutons, tomato, \ncucumber, tomato fonduta) .. both appetizers were presented beautifully and were quite tasty. There were nice sized morsels of the crab which complemented the Panzanella very well. The only thing I really didn't care for were the polenta fries which I found to be a bit on the bland side.\n\nThen came the main course .. my dinner partner ordered the Lasagna Bolognese (fresh pasta layered with veal, pork and beef rag\u00fa) which he said was almost as good as his mom's. :) I chose the Veal Parmigiana (thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce) .. which ended up being gigantic. It was perfectly seasoned and prepared, just the right amount of breading, sauce and cheese. DELICIOUS! It was every bit as delicious for lunch the next day as well. \n\nEven though we were both stuffed after the entrees, we definitely wanted to try dessert and boy were we glad. The Tiramisu was spectacular and we both quickly forgot how full we were :) .. \n\nThe service was fast and the server knowledgeable and professional. She and her team did a great job efficiently without being overbearing. Kudos to Sinatra for a great all around dining experience and we will certainly be back soon!"

Called for reservations noting an anniversary and asking for a special table near the window toward the read of the restaurant.  Told 'No Problem.'  We arrive at the restaurant which is nicely appointed I might add.  Orange table cloths and wonderful pictures of Sinatra in all his glory.  Being a huge \"Frank\" fan I'm loving it..  Lots of Sinatra music and a few \"Rat Pack\" sessions so I am thinking all is good.  Drinks were outstanding..  Time to be seated..  Well, let's just say the 'No Problem' request went out the door..  Ended up at a table near the entrance.  Seems the table in the area we wanted was given to someone else.. I asked about the \"no problem table' but after a few minutes of that \"I don't care/can't do anything for you/just take a seat\" stare from the hostess I figured there was no sense in pursuing the issue..  Not the way to kick off an anniversary celebration..  Moving on..  Waiter appears; runs down specials; hands dinner and drink menu along with wine list; advises who our waiter will be and promptly vanishes.  We sit.. We wait..  We sit..  We wait..  Approximately 20 minutes later our waiter appears.  Jovial guy..  He does the specials again..  We order another drink..  Waiter disappears..  We sit..  We wait..  We sit.. We wait..  Another 20 minutes and drinks appear.!  Order appetizers which were actually quite good.  Bread Salad with Crab was very nice as were the meatballs.  The polenta sticks were not my favorite..  Rather dull..  Main course of Chicken Parmesan which was mediocre at best and didn't stand out..  Eggplant Parmesan as a side was good..  Side of pasta with marinara was strange..  Pasta was nice; hand made and had the nice \"al dente\" of fresh but the sauce was odd..  More like a tomato cream sauce than a true marinara. \"Chef's Liberty\" I guess but not a good one.  Dessert was Ricotta Lollipops where were interesting but not overly tasty.  Wine list is long and expensive so be forewarned.  All in all Sinatra was not what I'd hoped for a special day like an anniversary.  Service was lacking; food middle-of-the-road and severely over priced; and, well, that \"No Problem Table\" is going to stick in my mind for a long time.  Restaurants are build on many things.  Service, food quality, presentation and, I think, promises.!  Frank would not have been pleased.!!!"

There is a small garden with pomegranate trees, which were light up at night and it was magical. The tables are big so you can fit in big parties. \n\nFOOD: For starters we ordered the Caprese salad, which was very small (i.e. three slices of tomato and mozzarella) and the Panzanella con Ganchio. For dinner we ordered Branzino and Tagliata. Note that when you ask for your meat to be prepared medium well, they bring it as if you asked for a well done. The meat is a bit dry and loses its taste.\n\nDESERT: The deserts are good; they put \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate, which was touching and cute.\n\nDRINKS: We ordered red wine (nothing special), after that I ordered the Sinatra Smash.\n\nSERVICE: The waiter was taking forever to bring us the food, the restaurant was not even full! A big NO NO for me was when the waiter took the fork from my starters' plate and left it for the main course without even changing it."

Our reservations were \nfor 6:30. We arrived promptly and were seated immediately. There weren't \nmany other people dining at that time. However, by the time we left \nevery table was occupied and there was a line out the door waiting. \nI knew it was gong to be a good night when they were able to offer some \nbetter vodkas for my martini. I had Ciroq. Last month when I ate at \nCarnevino they were excited to offer Grey Goose. (please, no thank you) \nI do not drink wine, but our friends did. They were pleased with the \nlist and found a red that they both enjoyed. \nFor appetizers, I had the scallop with celery and kumquats. Fabulous! \nIt simply melted in my mouth. The combination of flavors was \nexceptional. Get this! My husband had the romaine salad with lemon \nvinaigrette dressing. We both thought it was fabulous. I loved the \nanchovy croutons, he was not really a fan of them. \nThree different breads were served. All of them were great. My favorite \nwas the cheese. The olive was interesting and worth a taste. Be \ncareful not to fill up on these. It is very easy to do. They were \nyummy. \nFor dinner, I ordered the John Dory fillet. I read other reviews here \nand it seemed to be consistently great. It held true for me. It was by \nfar the best of our 4 meals. It was cooked to perfection. Again the \ncombination of flavors was perfect. I loved the truffle sauce and \nasparagus. \nMy husband ordered the shrimp rigatoni. It was OK. Of the four meals it \nwas our least favorite. There was nothing special about it. The red \nsauce was average. \nOur friends ordered the New York steak and the evenings pork special. \nBoth were great. The steak was served black and blue. I am not really a \nfan of steak and this won my heart. The pork special was also very \ntasty. We ordered side dishes of mushroom saute and vegetable \nratatouille. When I placed the order I asked the server if there would \nbe enough for the table since we wanted to share the mushrooms. He said \nabsolutely and they would be served family style. Well, this was not \nthe case. The portions were only enough for one person. We immediately \nasked him to bring more when he served them. I am accustomed to fine dining portions but \nwas surprised how small of a portion the side dished were. The mushrooms \nwere wonderful. Actually I could have had 2 scallops and a side of \nmushrooms as a meal. Maybe they should put that on the menu. \nWe decided to order dessert as well. We ordered the bomboloni and \ncappello. I liked the bomboloni better, but both were delightful. I \nwould definitely suggest you save room for both of these. \nService was wonderful through out the entire evening. I pick this over \nCarnevino. Given the choice between Envy and Sinatra, I would be hard \npressed to choose. Both were well worth every penny!"

This time it was different in that Steve Wynn was having dinner out on the patio and the staff was trying to keep the disturbance down to minimal. They succeeded. Even with the Big Boss on site, the service was extraordinary. Always attentive, and quick to offer suggestions. This time we split the Black Truffle Fettucini for an appetizer. If they have this when you dine here, ORDER IT!! Earthy and buttery and oh-so delicious. The wife had the Chicken Marsala while I had the Special, which was a perfectly cooked hunk of filet mignon with a wine-reduction sauce. The gelato dessert was ordered again, and enjoyed again. Then they brought out a pistachio panna cotta with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it in chocolate. The waiter suggested a dessert wine to accompany, and poured it gratis. After Steve left the manager came by the table to congratulate us, and when he found out that we had had our anniversary dinner at Sinatra every year since it has been open, gifted us with a signed picture of Steve and Frank and a private issue CD of the songs Steve selected for the restaurant. Then he was waiting for us as we left to congratulate us again and thank us for dining there. Total high-roller treatment for a couple of ordinary folk. This place is a winner and will always be on our list of faves. Thanks, Steve!"

Seeing Frank's coveted award memorabilia at the front was a great touch as we waited to be seated. The ambiance in general was immaculate (as it tends to be in Steve Wynn's newer hotels). Everything else was pretty forgettable.\n\nWe started out with the tuna tartare appetizer. I enjoyed it (the fish quality was great) but the portion was super tiny. My aunt and I opted to split the massive 20 oz. ribeye for our main course - it was pretty good, but I've had better. Overall, the food was solid. The real glaring flaw was the service. It was dismally slow, and we felt pretty neglected for most of the meal. It took quite a while for our meals to come out - I want to say about 35 minutes. That's fine, I get that making meals from scratch takes time, but no one checked up on us even once during that time, and we proceeded to get full off the bread basket (sigh). \n\nOverall, if you poke around, there are much better fine dining options in the hotel, on The Strip, and beyond. I can't wholeheartedly recommend this one."

When I came into the entrance of Sinatra, of course i checked out his Grammy, his Emmy and his Oscar in the glass cases and all of the old time pictures of him and Mr. Wynn and the Rat Pack. When I first checked in for my table, it was ready and the hostess showed me the way. Now, for a guy like me, from a small town no one has ever heard of in the Mid-West, this next moment impressed me so much and re-assured me that this was going to be an exceptional dinner. My waiter for the evening, came up to me at my table, and said, \"Good Evening Mr. Bedtka. how are you doing tonight?\" That blew my mind, first that he pronounced my name correctly, but that that kind of service exists that they take the time to greet you like that. After my drink order, I looked over the menu, and found the meatballs and polenta fries. Absolutely the best meatballs i have had and the fries were light, warm and airy. For my entree, i selected the Ossobuco \"My Way\". Love the title for this dish, probably my favorite Sinatra song lol. It was so tender that put my knife back down and only used my fork for the whole dish. The risotto was cooked perfectly, so creamy and flavorful. The decor, created by Roger Thomas, is so beautiful and full of Sinatra portraits. It's my new Italian restaurant that I will frequent with my trips to Vegas."

We were in a group of 12 or so, and maybe that added to our time while waiting for food but it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out.  My other issue was its very hard not to leave hungry.  I got the chicken parmigiana which was pretty good. (Seriously, why the hell do I order an entree I can get at Chili's for 10 bucks when they have better things on the menu? I have no idea.) But Sinatra's portion was very small.  We had to go eat less than 2 hours later because we were still hungry. If you have the time and aren't terribly hungry, Sinatra is probably worth a try."

THEY HAD ZERO TASTE WHAT SO EVER...\ni had the chicken parm for my entree it came out in a medal pan actually did not look that bad.. then i cut into it the chicken was very very thick and the cheese and sauce had no taste. after eating it i realized these dishes are 100% pre made. the side of spaghetti that was not included with the entree was so tiny and so mushy it could have passed as mashed potatoes. \nall 8 of us hated our food including the pasta with shrimp and lobster sauce and the lasagna. \nI'm not going to complain about the prices because we saw them before we went and i never mind paying money for a good meal.. BUT THIS PLACE IS NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO A GOD MEAL.. STAY AWAY unless your from the Midwest and u do not know good Italian food this place is a no go. from the casino host himself i guarantee this place will be done within 6 months"

The decor is beautiful and our table was against the large windows with a view of the outside garden area. The menus are cute too, each has a picture inside of Steven Wynn and Frank himself.\n\nThe service was impeccable beginning at the entrance of the restaurant. When I arrived the hostess handed me a handwritten birthday card, and throughout the entire dinner all the staff went out of their way to wish me a happy birthday.\n\nThe food was so delicious. Our party ordered nearly everything on the menu, including several bottles of chianti. One of the specials for the night was a black truffle pasta which was heavy but delicious. I had little bites of everything. The entree item I ordered was the pennette. Italian sausage ragu over pasta, amazing.\n\nDesserts (panna cotta and tiramisu) came out with candles on them and \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. I will post a pic here on Yelp. It was a fantastic ending to a wonderful meal.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to my next experience at Sinatra."

The day we went it was raining (surprisingly) so they were able without me asking to put the two of us next to the window looking out at the gardens.  Waiter addressed both of us as Mr and Ms. which was very nice, wine and beer prices were normal; 8$ premium draft beer, $7 wine.  Ordered a appetizer, didn't wait long for that.  My date ordered Pollo Chicken and I ordered the Chicken Parm.  Both were fantastic, portion was just right.  Bill at the end came to $125, which I was okay with, I was treated with class in an upscale place, with great food, music, and aroma.  Would go there again for sure."

Food took a long time to come out (we ordered pasta specifically because we were in a bit of a rush to watch a show)- but I don't think that reflects on the server, who was otherwise pretty good. Apparently you can't get out of paying for water here, because I'm pretty sure I ordered \"still\" (I think the other choices were bottled and spring), and I still found a charge on the bill. Oh well, that's Vegas. Bread was OK (Rosemary focaccia very good, Italian and bread sticks run-of-the-mill. All cold. Whatever happened to restaurants serving warm bread?). Ordered the pappardelle and spaghetti with clams. No complaints  about the taste. Way overpriced though. Apparently the pappardelle was fresh made, but for  nearly 30-40$/ pasta entree, ALL the pasta should be made in house (not dry and from a box) and taste like it. This didn't , so that was disappointing. We passed on dessert, and yet with one drink, salad, and a teeny bowl of veggies (not good), the total bill with T/T was  still more than150$. A decent meal, but definitely not in my top 20 Italian eateries. Probably wouldn't go back, unless someone else was footing the bill."

The room is smallish and the decor was somewhat subdued.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The menu is not extensive, with only a few entrees.  The lasagna entree was good, but the Osso Bucco, was outstanding and worth making a return visit for (the meat fell off the bone and was infused with wonderful flavor).

People weren't particularly hungry, so we did not over do it by ordering starters and sides.  \n\nI started with an excellent caesar's salad.  There wasn't anything unusual about this dish, but that's the way it should be when you order a caesar's salad.  For my main, I went with their Osso bucco.  Again, it seemed like a pretty standard preparation of this dish, but it was expertly done.  \n\nAll in all, my experience was very good here.

As usual we ordered many appetizers, including octopus affogato, meatballs, and lasagna, which were all pretty good.  \nWe also had mini-raviolis with truffles, which were unbelievable.   I savored every mini one-by-one, slooowly.  The lobster risotto was the best i have ever had.  In fact we ordered another one when we finished the first one.  Make sure the waiter sprinkles the truffles on top.  I had the ossobuco for the main course.  The sauce was not too strong, but the meat was very tender.\n\nGreat service, so we left a 20% tip.  Dinner for 2 came to $1070.00 (wine was a bit over-priced at $380).  Oh and they are pretty strict about the the dress code which is business casual(Wynn is about the only casino with a dress code)."

The restaurant is large but intimate and very classy. With the large picture of Frank and his music playing softly in the backround you know your in his restaurant. \n\nAfter being seated it did take quite a while for anyone to acknowledge us. No menus, no drink orders and no water service. Eventually someone in a suit (Sommellier?) came by to take our drink and wine orders. The menus and water service followed shortly after. The menu is classic italian; Antipasto, caprese, pastas, osso bucco, veal parm, etc. Our waiter was pretty quiet. The service was fine but nothing extraordinary or over the top which I would expect here. \n\nThe veal parm came highly recommended so I went with that. We also ordered a antipasto for the table and the panzanella con Granchio (lump blue crab, tomato and cucumber). Both appetizers were very good. The prosciutto and fresh buffalo mozzarella in the antipasto were excellent. The entrees arrived and the veal parm took up the entire plate, it was huge. It was covered in cheese and had the perfect amount of sauce. They also leave it on the bone which is a nice presentation. The veal was so tender and just melted in your mouth. \n\nFor dessert we had the gelato and the tiramisu. If you order gelato you get to choose 3 different flavors. We had Coconut, Hazelnut and Chocolate.The tiramisu was definately a better choice. The gelato was ok but served almost melted. \n\nOverall an excellent dinner and dining experience."

I begged him not to, but he insisted. Well, you know the place is good if they were able to prepare well-done lamb and still make it moist and juicy. I was quite impressed.\n\nAt the end of the meal, they mistakenly delivered us a birthday dessert with a candle in it and walked away too quickly for me to argue with them. Without thinking I blew out the candle, but then I guess the waiter realized his mistake and came back to retrieve the dessert. He apologized and walked away with it. I would think they would just leave it with us, since they certainly couldn't serve a cake that I'd already breathed on to someone else... Oh well, lol.\n\nDefinitely worth a trip.

While I can't think of anything I have eaten at Wynn or Encore that is anything worse than \"excellent\", that is a mighty noble feat. \n\nFrom the moment you enter through the sit down through the overall service, you cannot help but think that this is the way 'Ole Blue Eyes would have wanted to be treated. Never mind that there isn't really a bad seat in the place. Either you get a first hand view of the spectacular interior or the large portrait of the namesake that adorns the middle of the dining room. Choose to eat outside and get views of lush shrubbery and water. \n\nMy group ordered all over the menu and it was like a tasting party - but one where you can't go wrong. Frank's Spaghetti and Clams.....Osso Bucco \"My Way\" (SO soft and braised by the gods. Even if Osso Bucco is not your thing, ignore. This is in a class by itself)....Branzino.....the prepped-to-virtual-perfection Veal Parmigiana. My own dish was actually the Lasagna \"bolognese\" which is actually served in a little pot which you must do everything to avoid wanting to lick down after you consume the contents. \n\nPricewise, you can make it as expensive as you want to be but you can also spend in line with a \"nice\" meal and still be well fed. As as commonplace at Wynn/Encore, there is also a Vegan Menu. \n\nBy the way, highly recommended is an opening cocktail. Well known is the Sinatra Smash (which can have with or without whiskey) but, especially if you like being a toastmaster, give the \"Dream\" a shot - a delightful mix of Grand Brut champagne and St-Germain elderflower liqueur. \n\nVegas is now a treasure trove of dining but Sinatra is easily a place worth repeat visiting. By the way, there's a business casual dress code. You want to dress night anyway. Otherwise, Frank would smack you with his fedora... :)"

            "review": "We haven't been back to Sinatra's for over 5 years and it was worth the wait!  I've read that some feel it is over priced.  My opinion is that the price reflects the outstandingly superb experience one receives here. You are treated like royalty from the moment you step inside, to the moment you leave. Beautiful hostesses greet you and seat you. Our waiter, Thomas, was quick, charming, and offered to get the sommelier for my wine-related questions. He explained all specials and dishes, made recommendations when my husband asked, and was on point to refill wine glasses. The other waitstaff were unobtrusive in timely water refills and other activities. After each meal Thomas cleaned our table of crumbs. NOW LETS GET TO THE FOOD . We ordered appetizers of polpettines (meatballs) with polenta fries.  Best. Meatballs. Ever. (And my Italian dad made the best.).  And we ordered the polipo octopus salad with a dash of capers. My husband kept oooo-ing and ahhh-ING over this.  I had the penne sausage ragu, and husband had double porkchop pan-seared and lived the hint of wasabi and superb mashed potatoes.  The final dishes, dessert, were Pana cotta and ricotta cheese cake. Mind. Blowing. \n\nSo... If you want cheap, non-personalized service, don't come here.  However, If you want a total experience of joy - make reservations and wear appropriate dress.  It's soooo worth it!"

Service is solid, portions are decent but up sells on small items, like a \"side\" of a 1/2 cup soggy spaghetti in meat sauce for $10 was silly, and mediocre at best. Like most places in Vegas these days they are not providing what you'd expect for the money. Passable, but not worth a special visit by any means. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the abundance of good, reasonably priced restaurants here in AZ. See my review of Aiellos in Phoenix - that was what I expected here - but did not get."

I had the Ossobuco veal and he had the New York, with a bottle of Stag's Leap cab. Everything was wonderful. From the ambiance to the music to our older gentleman server, everything was what you expected it to be. Definitely a Sinatra hang out if he were still around. The music and dim lighting set an old Hollywood vibe. It's almost like he was there! Pricey but soooo worth it!"

            "review": "Wow. I've been waiting on this post, because I really don't like trashing a place in a public forum. Just seems like a trollish thing to do, and generally I'd only go one star for a personal offense directed at me or somebody in my party.  Thus, I'll go two stars - and the second star is only because it's in the Encore, an otherwise absolutely excellent experience from service to gaming to design to the thoughtful Wynn touch (and XS). \n\nThis is notable: absolutely the worst food I've had at a 'nice' restaurant. I'm sorry, Steve Wynn, I personally am because I almost feel like I'm slighting you by short-starring your friend Ol' Blue Eyes. Maybe I should have known naming it after a dead celeb would be a dead giveaway of its shitiness. \n\nLet me stop for a second and say something positive: I really did enjoy the decor - a large portrait of Frank adorns two walls in a somehow not overbearing way; the use of color is prominent & sophisticated, and the patio + open-facing sidewall was very appealing, and lent an air of openness to the space. Fun setup, and competent staff, if not wholly memorable. And kudos for setting the bar tv on an endless reel of Frank movies. And of course the soundtrack (all Frank) is amazing. But the food. . . \n\nI had the lamb ossobucco as recommended by the server - \"my personal favorite.\"  The lamb literally was so rich, crossing my lips with an almost gamey flavor. The accompanying risotto was layered in salt.  Not just that it \"was salty,\" I'm telling you I needed water for about two hours straight after he meal. Had their shrimp appetizer which tasted like a shrimp cocktail, only deconstructed - boring, but at least not bad. Had their meatballs  - which were fine, in that  they tasted like costco meatballs, which I actually like (dark secret) but when you're paying $25 for an appetizer of four meatballs, please prepare something special. \n\nLastly, tried the lasagna - inedible. Kid you not. Wasn't even good enough to choke down. How do you mess up Lasagna at a place named after this legend. Again - the d\u00e9cor was great, the service was fun but what a horrible FOOD experience. Wow.\n\nFun stuff though and it was expensed so like I say - a bad experience makes a good story. And because of Steve Wynn & the milieu at the Encore, I refuse to give it the one star it truly deserves."

We talked to her, inquiring when the restaurant would open. It was very clear that we had intentions of dining there. She gave what appeared to be a very fake looking smile. In case, you are wondering, this is the smile where you purse your lips together and pinch your nose at the same time.  I thought it was my imagination-- at first.  \n\nMy friend and I both had reservations at Sinatra. We were there on time and looking at the menu. We noticed at the bottom of the really expensively priced menu that there was a note saying that business casual attire was needed.  Well, since the hostess didn't say anything to us we thought that what we were wearing would be ok.\n\nWhen the restaurant officially opened at 5:30pm, the hostess took down the red rope and let us in. There was a small crowd. There was some guy in a polo shirt with his wife, who happened to be in an evening gown. (I didn't know that qualifies as business casual? Unless his wife is a cocktail waitress...)   \n\nThe hostess let that pair in first. When it got to our turn, she told us to please step aside and into the lounge area. This was basically seats next next to the bar, on what were ornamental aka not weight bearing chairs. We sat in these uncomfortable show-pieces. The hostess indicated that she just needed to 'check on something with the computer'. (OK.) The bar guy offered us expensive drinks. (No.)  Then, she proceeded to congregate 4 managers. Yes, four managers at the podium.  They whispered freverently for like 5-10 minutes. The male one nodded his head while staring at us.  Then, they sent over a different female manager over to talk to us.\n\nI know the female manager was just trying to do her job, but seriously tact training is required. She came over to us and said that she was sorry but \"athletic apparel is not allowed in the restaurant.\"  But \"if you would like to stay, you can eat in the lounge area? We can serve you the regular food out here.\"  (UM. Yeah, right, $100 dollars to be fed pasta on a wobbly table made of glitter & paste. While being treated as second hand citizens-- when polo shirt boy got in?)\n\nI'm sorry but you could have just told us about the attire policy, when we asked about eating there. Instead of congregating 4 managers, making a show of things, and then treating us so condesendingly. \nShe then offered 'suggestions for other places we could eat' at the Wynn.  This was like the final blow! \n\nAfter that, my friend and I politely declined and left.  It soured our taste for spending money in such an uppity place.  After that, I vowed to come on Yelp and warn other foodies!  Seriously, there are much better places all around. Service is half the price you pay for."

My brother played sax with his songs I sang his songs in jazz choir back in college, and his music is so heavenly that a restaurant after him is so appropriate. \n   Good music and what else? Good food and even better to be in the Encore.\n   My partner works at the Wynn so we decided on a dinner after Valentines day to ease the congestion of the typical dinner on a Sunday. A Monday is good.\n   Appetizer: tuna was good half way though I realize it was missing something and I was staring at it; the spiced olive/pickle that was fanned out added the perfect punch to the relishy chopped mix. \n   Ossobuco: never had it before and Frank(partner)(yes how ironic the name), had it. What I expected; soft and tender.meaty great yummy sauce thicker than what I envisioned. The risotto a nice touch with it. Great dish but would be better with a more onion punch. I'm Asian born in Cali so I like strong flavor. \n   I had the Rombo ; read reviews about it . I had to try it for myself I loved it and savores every bite. A soft white fish with a buttersquash and the nuttyness of what I called truffle oil? I asked the waiter and he said yes it's in the dish. I loved it delicate, but exotic and just could not help, but the flavor kept making me smile. Try it I dare you guys can't help but smile when enjoying this dish.\n  We were full but our waiter nicely brought out tiramisu and said \"just a taste\" well it was good. Yummy a nice flavor not as soggy as other reviews say. Not too rich and not too light very good chocolate and cream was fantastic.\n   Yes I would cone back for a different appetizer, I would get my rombo again. And loved tiramisu but I like trying new things. Beautiful restaurant, nice furniture and view by the patio. We were once again the youngest ones there so don't  be fooled by age. We gave our waiter a 28% tip."

Sinatra is tucked into the last little corner of Encore. In fact on our last Vegas trip we simply happened upon it while walking through the casino.  \n\nAs you enter the restaurant classic photos line the wall to greet you and a case holding some of his most prestigious awards mirrors the host's podium. We were seated at an elegant corner booth, serenaded by Mr. S.\n\nWe started with a cocktail, I had a light and sweet Bellini, Jacob his normal Knob Creek on the rocks. We began dinner with a caprese salad, the variety of tomatoes were sweet and flavorful especially for February.  The buffalo mozzarella was creamy and incredibly fresh, it was a perfect beginning. \n\nFor our entrees I had the lobster chanterelle mushroom risotto, so earthy, delicate, and creamy. The lobster was rich and succulent. Jacob had the classic Italian Lasagna Bolognese, with hand made pasta sheets and a veal, pork and beef Bolognese sauce. Everything tasted incredible and the quality was phenomenal. \n\nFinally for dessert we choose the Torta di Ricotta, a cannoli flavored cheesecake with a side of pistachio gelato, a perfect light ending to our elegant meal. I definitely have \"High Hopes\" for out next visit to Sinatra."

Nothing looked available on Opentable.  Thank goodness for the concierge at the Encore.  She recommended Sinatra (which I knew Nothing about) and called up and made us a reservation within 10 minutes.\n\nWhen it comes to restaurants in Vegas, my expectations are low.  I find places loud, crowded, gaudy, overpriced & overhyped.  \n\nAs we approached the restaurant, located in the Encore, we saw photos & awards of Frank.  (They need photos of Frank & Ava; they looked damn good together.)\n\nWe were immediately greeted and taken to a quiet intimate table.  There were people, but they were far away.  Privacy at a Vegas restaurant?  Spectacular.  The decor made one nostalgic for the Vegas Rat Pack days.  There are giant photos of Frank and they had his music playing (yes, I'm a fan and have his greatest hits on my iTunes).  Its simple, yet elegant.\n\nThen, I don't know if the host was the manager, but he stayed and chit chatted with us for about 10 minutes.  Between the decor, music & personable host, we were relaxed and in quite the amorous mood.  \n\nA bottle of Chianti-Very Good\nCaprese-thought this was standard but was really craving it\nInsalatina Dell Imperatore-they do Caesar salad right w/anchovy \nOssobuco My Way-Very Good (but a big portion and couldn't even come close to finishing)\n\nWas it pricey?  Of course, its Vegas.  BUT, it was worth every penny (a rare statement by me in Vegas).  Hands down my favorite dinner (and my husband agrees) in Vegas."

Our waiter recommended we order a side of pasta because the chicken doesn't come with it.  The sauce on the pasta was flavorful, but there was so much chicken we really didn't need extra food to go with it.  My friend said the lasagna was the best she ever had.  After dinner they brought a free birthday dessert.  It was very pretty, but tasted absolutely horrible because there was coffee-flavored cake layered throughout and it was bitter and we couldn't eat it.

Awesome that they have so many options but my vegan dish and my husband's non-vegan dish were both very bland and very over-priced!!  I had to ask for salt just to give the food some flavor.  Could have made more tasty food ourselves.  Very underwhelmed, definitely would not go again and would not recommend.  Also, they were running behind so we weren't seated until over 15 minutes after our reservation.  That would have been fine if the food was good but it was definitely not worth the wait."

The wine list was above average for an Italian restaurant. If this were in NYC it would possibly disappear in the glitz. A fine escape from the upscale modern cuisine, this is a great deviation from the normal mono-theistic gravy-over-pasta joint like Cafe Lamberti. There are just so many other choices it makes a 5th star difficult to attain. Overall a great experience."

Just not good at at. No offer of grated parm.  Wish I had my $100 plus back. I would just go here for a cocktail. Nice ambience but lots of older people yelling. We thought this would be best experience of trip. They offered free coffee or dessert but we passed when we complained to waiter he had brought over the manager. It was just edible but ragu or prego a billion times better. We enjoyed joes steak at forum shops & Giada brunch Saturday at Cromwell. Well worth the prices there. We won't be back to sinatras unfortunately. Cocktails good. Free bread basket."

Reservation was made for 7pm, yet despite arriving two minutes early, we were made to wait ten minutes. Another party, arriving after us, was seated first. The mocktail I had in the meantime - Sinatra splash(?) was way too sweet and not good at all.  Eventually, though, we did receive one of the three best tables in the house, so this wait could be forgiven.   \n\nOur server was cold and pushed the sale of alcohol.  We are avid wine drinkers, but since I'm pregnant, we decided to skip libations that evening.  He still asked my husband three times if he wanted something from the bar and even went on to slowly explain that they offer wine by the glass. Despite hearing three times 'no', he insisted on leaving wine menu on our table \"just in case.\"  That level of sales push is unacceptable in a fine dining establishment. \n\nOnto the food. We shared a vegetable salad, which was tasty. I had the lamb, and while perfectly proper, I didn't find it overly exciting. I felt the presentation was uninspired.  The plate was way too big and it seemed that the chef was trying to cater to the median palate and stomach size. The lamb was also quite fatty, but given the size, I could cut off the fatty parts and still was left very satisfied. My husband ordered the veal parmigiana, which was enormous, but he really enjoyed it.  Desserts were the highlight. Tiramisu, though not classic, was light and fluffy and very good. The panna cotta was easily among the best we've ever tried and my husband is a big panna cotta aficionado.  Sadly, cappuccinos were bad. Too much too hot water in the shot, too much milk and not enough foam - the foam not creamy. \n\nOnto the bad. At 3am I woke up with horrible nausea.  I spent three hours battling the symptoms of food poisoning. In the morning, my husband told me that he woke up earlier, closer to midnight, with a very bad heartburn and some nausea.  The next day was tainted by my stomach playing up. Yes, I am pregnant, but seven months of my pregnancy had passed with no gastric episodes whatsoever before I dined at Sinatra. I blame the veg salad that we shared. We also shared both desserts, but it's the thought of this salad that gives me the chills. \n\nSo, my rating is as follows - the food 4.5, half less star for the service and additional star for the medical aftershocks."

It's still fabulous. Servers and host staff are very accommodating to your every wish. The decor is absolutely beautiful with a lush garden venue available for those who would like to dine alfresco complete with fireplaces and heaters for cooler weather. Menu is somewhat limited but complete in meat, fish and pasta categories. We decided to share a filet ( as ten ounce is the smallest available ) with pasta and a mixed green salad which we also shared. Our server placed everything in center of the table even going as far a slicing the filet for us. It was a true dining experience while listening to Frank croon in the back ground. To top it off we shared an over the top pana cotta and a flight of vintage ports from ten to forty years of age. There are many great  choices for Italian food in Las Vegas but as Steve Wynn says in the menu forward; I think Frank would really like this place- and so will you!"

With the almighty Sinatra's awards displayed for all patrons to see, golden curtains draping across the windows to the beautifully lit outdoor patio, and a cozy, intimate feel in the dining room, there's no wonder Encore guests deem this to be one of the most alluring restaurants to dine at.\n\nSwoon to Frank's biggest hits as you sip on a glass of wine or one of their specialty cocktails. The bellini was peachy sweet and smooth. A bit heavy on the peach puree, but just the right amount of bubbly. Everything about this venue is classy, including the menus. A soft glossy binder with a very simple selection of pastas, meat, and seafood - I've never admired such immense detail in a restaurant.\n\nBeing forewarned by previous diners, I decided to split an order of the chicken parmigiana and a side of penne pasta with my gal pal. Originally, the side was supposed to be spaghetti, but I asked our waiter if we could substitute it to any other pasta and penne was on the list. \n\nThe chicken was superb! Moist and tender, but not overly drenched in tomato sauce. The mozzarella was baked to a browned ooey gooey perfection and just melted in my mouth. I tried a taste of my friend's chicken saltimbocca (prosciutto wrapped chicken breast w/ asiago & sage) which was rich in flavor, but the prosciutto was overcooked and didn't melt onto the chicken. The capesante (seared Maine diver scallops) was my favorite dish of the evening. 4 plump scallops crispy on the outside, firm and chewy on the inside. The chef did a wonderful job searing each piece perfectly. \n\nThe only factor that caused Sinatra to fall short of a 5-star review was that the prices were waaay overpriced for what you're getting. But I suppose it's true when they say you're paying for the ambiance. For Italian influenced cuisine, I don't believe 2 slices of chicken parmigiana should cost $30...no matter how delicious they were. \n\nRegardless, I'd come back. I'll just have to work extra hard at the tables before walking through the front door though."

To start, we were served a basket of bread (some different loaves, bread sticks, and cheese crackers), along with butter with buds of basil (they tasted like that, anyway). They were just okay. \n\nI ordered chicken with mushrooms and gnocchi. The chicken was the most tender chicken I've probably ever had, but it was fairly bland.\n\nI tried the scallops with cauliflower puree and blood orange. The scallops were AMAZING! Seared on the outside, buttery on the inside, and perfectly flavored. The cauliflower puree was a pleasant surprise. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but lighter with a gentle taste of cauliflower. \n\nMy dad, who ordered the lobster risotto, said it was the most delicious risotto he's ever had. It came with large chunks of lobster on top, as would be expected for a $41 dish. \n\nAll desserts are $12 and I tried the tiramisu as well as a pumpkin cake thing. The tiramisu -- which people seem to rave about -- was kind of watery. It was served in a big martini glass and the presentation was beautiful, but it tasted overly soggy. The pumpkin cake thing (I'm sure it has a fancy italian name I can't spell or pronounce) was average-tasting, but pretty to look at!\n\nThe service was great!

We enjoyed our dinner at Sinatra even more than the highly rated Picasso.\n\nYou feel the energy and vibe from the minute you walk in.  Great decor and music playing in the background.  We loved our table for two by the window.\n\nThe prosciutto and melon appetizer was great.  So much prosciutto I asked for a couple more slices of melon to finish it all.\n\nI had the lobster risotto and my friend had the osso buco.  Both were outstanding although I thought the osso buco could have been a little larger and meatier for the price.\n\nDessert was an awesome tiramisu.\n\nOur server, Lawrence, was amazing.\n\nI can't imagine coming back to Las Vegas and not dining at Sinatra again."

Not only did I not feel like second class or a hassle due to my diet but I felt that Sinatra went out of their way to make me feel super special. I got vegan bread with vegan butter and cannellini beans spread. I got a complimentary beet salad amuse bouche. I had the zuppa de fagiole, the butternut squash agniolati, and the desert was coconut ice creamy stuff with fresh fruit. I also got complimentary vegan chocolates. I've never been so happy with a restaurant. Must try for vegans and vegetarians."

Instead of the chicken parmigiana being the hearty, home-style Italian cooking it should have been, it was just one very large piece of greasy, fried I don't know what with a side of what might as well have been tomato paste. I'm pretty sure the Chef lied on his resume and that his previous experience was actually at Kentucky Fried Chicken or Disneyland. My dad had the lasagna and he might as well have stayed home and heated up the Lean Cuisine brand in the microwave. The server couldn't offer a smile once the entire time - and he made it clear he was there only to flip our table and move on. Actually, his personality matched the food perfectly - completely unenticing. The only positive thing I can offer is that the interior design is brilliant. An hour and $500 later for 3 PEOPLE, I think I've made my point that this place is god awful. I know Frank would agree, the best is YET to come ;)"

Wife's vegan and she and I wanted a date night during our Vegas trip, so decided to sample how the other side (i.e. those who have money) lives for once.  We had heard that Sinatra was really good to vegans so we snagged a reservation and checked them out.  \n\nFirst thing we noticed was when I told the server my wife was vegan, upon bringing out the bread they separated the bread that had cheese on it from everything else and also gave her Earth Balance to use instead of regular butter.  That's pretty cool.  And their drink menu is gigantic.  Lots of awesome options for those who favor the harder stuff over beer/wine, those of course being me.\n\nAfter we had pounded a couple cocktails we both got the chicken parmigiana (with hers being the \"chicken\", aka Gardein version).  Now, being that I don't eat at fancy restaurants like these all that often, I was curious what their entree portion size was like.  I have to admit I was a bit skeptical that we might end up in something out of American Psycho and get a $100 plate of elaborately-decorated thimble-sized food.  But such was not the case!  They bring my plate out and it's two huge cuts with the chicken absolutely dominated with cheese.    Same for the wife for her Gardein version with vegan cheese.  I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LET ME DOWN, FRANK! \n\nIt was delicious as all hell and though we really wanted to try the vegan chocolate bar dessert, we were entirely too full.  It is still a pricey affair - two drinks, two entrees and a side ran us $140 after tip - but it's a lovely atmosphere, we got plenty of food and the staff was extremely friendly and treated my wife like vegan royalty.  Gotta say, I'm impressed."

Resos recommended.\nThe dishes to me are perhaps pricier than they need to be for what you get... BUT.. if you order the clams and spaghetti like I did ($33), you will get a ton of clams heaped on and pasta that is not overcooked, phew! Too many places overcook their pasta and you feel ripped off, not here. Some may say the seasoning is a bit too much but for me it was fine. Especially as there is no salt and pepper on the table. The clams had been properly cleaned and were not gritty.\nI had to ask for black pepper for my pasta and it should have been offered for my appetizer salad but, small detail. \nThe Riesling white wine was very good but for $16 a glass it better be!\nMy friends each had the lasagna (also around $33) and enjoyed it. I found portions to be adequate.\nI do recommend the Caesar salad to start although I found it to be missing that bit of bacon to make it extra yummy. Perfectly cool and crisp lettuce, dressed perfectly, not overloaded with croutons.\nWe also shared a Caprese salad and while this was a less hearty option, staff split it on 2 plates without us even asking and the mozza was very fresh. \nWe skipped dessert as we were just too full but we left feeling like we had a nice meal and would recommend if staying at or near Wynn/Encore."

The ambiance is fantastic, with actual Sinatra memorabilia, up to par with the high cost, but the Veal Parmesan tasted like it was from late night diner, smothered in a bland tomato sauce. Our party of 7 received their meals all at different times, and way past an acceptable timeframe.\n The risotto was drowned in butter and cream, a cheap and easy way to make anything taste better. I could go on, every aspect, with the exception of a wonderful Somelier, was extremely substandard. When the over $1K bill came, (that's only 2 bottles of wine) and our dis-satisfaction was communicated with the manager, he offered to remove the automatic 18% tip. We were a party of 7, not 8, so this was an additional mistake. I simply said, \"How about a Scotch at the bar, on ol blue eyes\"\nThe manager obliged,  and proceeded to tell the bartender to poor neat, the cheapest whisky they had.\nOne last chance for redemption, I honestly hate bad reviews, and bam!

All weekend I looked forward to it and when I called to make reservations the operator was very patient and help me pick a good restaurant. Italian, mid-ranged prices, named after one of the best singer's ever. Yes, thank you, resrevation for two! While the decor was a bit more casual than I would expect for an Italian restaurant, I enjoyed the atmosphere and all the Sinatra memorabilia covering the walls. Now onto the food...\n\nWe got both the vegan version of the beet salad (ie sans cheese) and the  heirloom tomato salad. Tomato salad was ok, very delicious ingredients with lots of flavor but the simplicity of this dish was put to shame but the flavor explosion that was the beet salad. Good Lord! You MUST get the beet salad, absolutely delicious, it was so special with the pieces of citrus and what a beautiful presentation! \n\nThe bf is not vegan but he said his vegetarian ravioli with asparagus creme melted in his mouth. I imagine they must make it on-site. Now I had eaten some \"vegan rissotto\" at Sensi at the Bellagio just 2 days before and it was sadly one of the worst meals I have ever had. Severely undercooked and bland bland bland! The mushroom risotto at Sinatra however, was bursting with flavor, creamy, and chock full of exotic mushrooms in every single bite. I like to savor my food and save the best for last but it soon became clear that this risotto had plenty of yummy mushrooms to go around. Literally several per bite. I Seriously, they do not skimp! \n\nThey also had homemade fruit sorbets that were like a punch of tart, vibrant flavor in every bite. SOOO amazing! \n\nAlso, the service was impeccable and so attentive. When a (for lack of better term) busboy saw me stand up and turn towards the right (the entrance was to the left), he stopped what he was doing and walked over to the door that leads out to the hallway with the restrooms, and waited for me to walk over and opened the door for me. One of the best meals and best dining experiences I've ever had. I will definitely be back every time I'm in Vegas to explore more of Steve Wynn's delicious vegan options!"

I came away so impressed with everything about Sinatra - the service, the food, the decor.\n\nUpon arrival for our reservation, we were promptly seated at a table where a handwritten card greeted us and thanked us for celebrating our anniversary at Sinatra. We had three different people congratulate us as well - the hostess and 2 servers. \n\nWe are typically \"steak people\" instead of seafood/pasta but we just knew that anything coming out of Sinatra's kitchen would be delicious so we veered from our norms. We split the Caprese salad and I went with the Lobster Risotto and my wife ordered the Agnolotti, knowing we would probably trade plates halfway through. They also brought a variety of breads and butters/spreads - all delicious. The Caprese was a perfect example how simple ingredients can come together to be something outstanding. A variety of tomatoes and a great balsamic made this the best that I have had.\n\nThe lobster risotto came with large chunks of butter poached lobster and a light risotto in cream sauce. The Agnolotti were filled with cheese and soaked in an oil/basil sauce. We finished off the meal with the tiramisu recommended by our waiter which was exquisite.\n\nI have absolutely no complaints. If you want to get real picky - it was a bit on the noisy side, but I prefer that sometimes.\n\nThe service was top notch and I was able to enjoy this all while sitting directly beneath a 6 foot tall painting of Old Blue Eyes. It doesn't get any better."

The waiter brought my wine, and then disappeared. We literally did not see, speak to or hear from him again for the rest of our visit.\n\nThat meant that when my glass needed refilling, busboys had to be flagged down. When our dishes came and no parmesan cheese was offered, busboys had to be flagged down again. No one came by to ask us how our dishes were and if we needed anything else. When we wanted dessert and the check? A manager came and apologized to us, gave us our check (no comps offered, if you're wondering), then went on her merry way.\n\nYep - even after we complained about being totally and completely ignored, the waiter never returned to apologize or explain. \n\nGuess it's Spago for my next Vegas outing instead."

The beef carpaccio is perfectly seasoned with salt and olive oil with fresh arugula on top. The polpitine made fresh with great flavor. The aglonotti is out of this world with savory ricotta and a silky smooth asparagus sauce. The Franks clams is great combination of pasta and fresh manila clams that you will soak up the sauce and leave the dish clean. For entr\u00e9es you can't go wrong the halibut is a nice large pieces cooked to perfection and the lobster risotto is just savory and out of this world. Of course I am still a kid at heart so I usually go with the the chicken parm which has huge portions with a fresh sauce not too bulky and chicken itself is just as fresh as it gets. Few more then I'll be done. Osso buco just falls off the bone with another well cooked risotto. The pollo which is like their version of a chicken Marsala is rich and complimented well with gnocchi. Can't go wrong with any of the desserts and Sinatra Smash as a cocktail. Service is phenomenal and the atmosphere is the a amazing blend of upbeat and relaxed. To say the least it is the best."

I'm not used to having so many choices, especially in a fine dining restaurant! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sinatra to any vegans who find themselves in Las Vegas! A perfect place for a special occasion meal... and honestly, it wasn't even as expensive as we were prepared for it to be!\n\nMy husband isn't even vegan, but he found the vegan menu so compelling that he ordered the vegan chicken parmesan, and it was ridiculously good. I had the vegan Caesar salad and chicken marsala (which came with vegan gnocchi!) and they were both outstanding. Sadly, we got too stuffed to eat dessert!\n\nIn addition to the food, the service was perfect! They really paid attention to little details. When we arrived, they gave us a handwritten Thank You card for coming to spend our special day with them. At the end of the meal, they brought us some sorbet on a plate that had Happy Anniversary written on it in chocolate. Also, the busser originally told me they were out of vegan butter, which was no big deal for me..... we asked for olive oil instead, and it was the best olive oil I have ever eaten. Then, like 10 minutes later, he showed up with vegan butter, explaining they went and got some from a different restaurant for me! Talk about going the extra mile! \n\nThank you for making our anniversary so special! I'm already dreaming of returning for my birthday! :-)"

Unlike the Encore Hotel in which the restaurant resides, the decor is reminiscent of 1950s \"Hollywood\" class that reminds you of an upscale bar/lounge with plush seating.  The foyer houses two pedestal cases bearing homage to Old Blue Eyes, prominently displaying his Emmy and Oscar trophies.\n\nThe menu was fairly simple with some classic Italian favorites.  My colleague and I wanted to try everything but opted for some house recommendations: the Cappesante (seared maine diver scallop, with a light celery and kumquat salad); freshmade rigatoni and agnolotti; and tiramisu the Sinatra way.\n\nThe flavor contrast between courses, as recommended by our server, was much appreciated.  The Cappesante delivered a delicious, clean punch.  And our server, without even having been asked, split the flavorful rigatoni and agnolotti for us (so thoughtful and much more elegant than if we were to dig in each other's plates from across the table!).  The tiramisu is something not to be missed.  \n\nThis is a place that I would certainly want to make a return visit to on my next trip to Las Vegas."

Balsamic vinegar can be ordered to accompany the extra-virgin olive oil.  Try not to overindulge in bread since you don't want to ruin your appetite.  To wet our appetite, we ordered a round of Under the Tuscan Sun drinks: a cocktail with vodka and a mixture of juices.  It reminded me of a mix of a sunrise and a seabreeze.  We ordered: Caprese, Capponatina, Lasagna Bolognese, Tagliata (bone-in ribeye with eggplant parmasan), and Ossobuco.  This meal was one of the best that I've ever had in Las Vegas.  The dishes come out piping hot and are worth the wait.   The food was delicious and the meat was tender.  The tomatoes in the caprese were a mix of heirloom, cherry, & hothouse; some of them were not as ripe as they should have been, but overall it was good because of the soft Buffalo mozzarella.  The ossobuco and gremalata was so soft and juicy.  The ribeye was the perfect tender medium rare.  The lasagna would make you cry, it's so good.  \n\nThis place is swanky!  It's like stepping into another era.  The furnishings are impressive: reminiscent of 1950s old Hollywood, bright, stylish and bold.  There is a dress code, but nothing too restrictive.

When I contacted the restaurant to inform them they had a number of questions and wanted to investigate. They called back a few days later and said they were sure it wasn't their fault. I explained that this was the only place all week that my wife and I shared food and we were quite sure it was from their restaurant. They responded that I was wrong and would not offer a refund or even an apology."

            "review": "We came to Sinatra to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  From the very second we walked in the door of Sinatra, we were treated like royalty.  The two lovely ladies at the front check in welcomed us warmly and offered to hang my coat.  I opted to keep it as I get a little chilly, and it was tailor made for me and I rarely let it out of my sight. We were also welcomed with a card wishing us a happy anniversary. Beautifully handwritten and personalized.  I knew right then, this was going to be great.\n\nWe visited the bar first, as we were a few minutes early.  The bar tender was very busy, yet  very nice and the Pinot Gregio was probably the best I've ever tasted. So smooth and just a brilliant wine.  Hubby had a Bloody Mary and said it was nice.\n\nWhen we were seated for dinner, our table had a lovely view of the garden patio and fireplace.  Had it been a bit warmer, we may have enjoyed appetizers or dessert out there, but it was in the 40s.  The dining room had such a genuinely warm feel, it was almost as if 'Old Blue Eyes' were in the room.  I believe he was, at least in spirit.\n\nThe service at Sinatra is WORLD CLASS. Actually, I will say it is absolutely the best service we've ever had anywhere, ever.  We have been all over the world, dined at Michelin restaurants across the globe. Without question, Sinatra is better than any restaurant we have experienced.\n\nWhile I cannot remember our server's name, he was impeccable!  We never wanted for anything.  Our glasses were always filled, and he was so knowledgeable about each dish and was great in giving his ideas on each dish. \n\nWe started with a lovely Caesar salad that was just perfect. Not too much, not too little and perfectly plated.  To our great surprise, the chef sent out a most delightful butternut squash bisque with his compliments for our anniversary.  I LOVE butternut squash. and this bisque was just amazing.  Perfection!\n\nNext, our main course arrived. Hubby had 'Filetto' 10 oz beef tenderloin and I had 'Agnolotti' small pasta pockets filled with butternut squash and parmesan. My dish was sheer perfection and brilliantly presented. It was so wonderful and perfectly portioned, cooked to perfection and the taste was too incredible to put into words.  Then, there was my hubby's filet. Oh, my!  There are truly no words to describe this one either. It was by far, the very best tenderloin either of us have ever tasted!  It practically melted in our mouths. SO delicious! There are no words. Cooked to perfection and beautifully plated. Again, just the perfect amount to enjoy.  I could not eat all of my dinner, but hubby would have licked the plate clean if we were at home.  It was just that awesome.  We also shared a side Purea di Patate, mashed potatoes, which were excellent.\n\nWe lingered a bit longer enjoying and savoring our memory of an awesome dinner when the staff came and presented us with a personalized dessert for our anniversary!  It featured the famous 'Frank's Hat' and a lovely layer chocolate mousse.  What can I say? That was exceptional!  Tremendously delicious and the perfect ending to a world-class amazing meal.\n\nWe waited a while and hoped the check would come, but it never did.  Our server asked if we cared for anything more, and hubby asked for our check.  He walked away and returned and said that this meal was compliments of our adult children!  OMG! I started crying. I could not believe it.  The staff knew all along and kept it secret.\n\nIt was the meal of a lifetime, one we will always remember."

            "review": "Can't begging to tell u how overrated and disappointing this restaurant is. I ordered their signature dish, the 12 ounce veal chop parmigiana - it's huge and the meat Itself is good quality. Before you dig into it, it looks like it'll melt in your mouth. But, as several have commented it's bland and even worse, they have a most bitter tomato sauce. To boot, I ordered a side of spaghetti, cooked perfectly al Dente and then as you taste it, the same bitter almost inedible tomato sauce.  For just about $60 for a veal chop (which I'm thrilled to lay but it does come with expectations of quality and taste) it should've been 1000x better than this. I started with the Caesar salad which has a lemon zest kick and the crunchy lettuce was good and fresh too but again has a bitterness to it.  I never felt like I left a restaurant and needed something sweet to get the bitter horrible taste out of my mouth. What a bummer, I was excited for this restaurant and it's a major disappointment.  Frankly, maggianos little Italy has a sauce that blows this away, surely not the same quality meat, but at least it tastes good."

Whether it is with locals for a drink or a full blown dinner or friends, family or business visiting from out of town, I always point us towards Sinatra. The bar is a memorable event with great drinks and ambiance unless they have some lame college sporting event on the tv that plays no relevance in the sporting world... go back to old Sinatra flicks. The design of the bar from floor to ceiling is interesting and great talking points. The colors and fabrics are all cool! Then there is dinner... that hits it out of the park. It may not be traditional Italian fare, but I love it all the same. The flavors are \"close your month and see it\" good. Can't wait to go back next week. It never gets old."

The server, after hearing my husband ask me if it was on the menu (he didn't know what it was called), stated that he would ask the chef to prepare it. It was a delicious treat. \n\nI cannot remember exactly what it was called but I got the salad with lump crab meat and avocado. It was outstanding. I want to go back just to have it again. Additionally I tried the beet salad. It was perfectly dressed and fantastic. \n\nI ordered the New York Strip Medium and, while the steak was good, it was a little too charred for my taste. I ordered the polenta fries for my side. Sprinkled with parmesan, they were very tasty. \n\nDessert stole the show! We had the Ricotta Lollipops. They were so good. The Ricotta cheese on the inside was sweet and creamy. The crust on the outside was chocolate with little crunchy crispies. These were to die for. Additionally, we had the Tiramisu. I'm not the biggest fan of this dish but it was very good here. The cake was very moist and the coffee flavor was not too overbearing. \n\nThe ambiance in this place is elegant but  cool. It seems like a place that Mr. Sinatra would have hung out in with his friends. We came 5 days before Christmas and got to listen to Christmas carols, Sinatra style, so that was a treat. \n\nAll in all excellent food, great service, cool vibe. I can't wait to return!"

From the decor to the service and most importantly the food. At first just the theme of a restaurant dedicated to old blue eyes seemed like a novelty. However the nostalgia just adds to the flavor. Had the beef carpaccio with arugula which was fresh and amazing. The spaghetti and clams was fantastic, and for dessert pana cotta shaped in Franks derby. Definitely worth a try even if you aren't a Sinatra fan"

We split a delicious green salad with a variety of tomatoes and watermelon. Too bad they did not split it for us in the kitchen making our efforts awkward. Lasagna was served with a  spicey meat sauce in a cute little pan. Halibut on a bed of corn had potential if not for the overcooked fish. Gratis dessert of panna cotta was a nice touch along with a card in honor of our anniversary."

            "review": "Latest visit to Las Vegas had us staying at the Wynn Resort.  After a day on the casino floor, we thought that we would end the day on a high note with dinner at Sinatra.  We called from the casino floor at 6:00 and was told that we could get right in if we did not wait until later.  Although this was a bit earlier than we would have liked, we hiked over to Encore for a fine meal.  As it turned out, it was OK, but no more satisfying than our gambling luck.\n\nWe were surprised to see that Steak Sinatra was no longer on the menu.  Our waiter checked to see if it could still be ordered  and was told that it was now called Filetto.  Since this was a different cut of meat and a peppercorn sauce would make it Steak Au Poivre, I knew my wife was going to end up with a meal that she did not expect.  I went with the lasagna because I was sure I knew what I would end up with.  Although the place was only half full, the order took some time.  That was fine with me.  It gave us time to enjoy the beautiful room, the wine and tasty antipasto.  Finally the entrees arrived.  A plain filet on a plain plate was place in front of my wife, the pepper sauce came in a small plain holder placed on the table.  My wife commented that for  $56 they could have at least placed some sort of garnish on the plate - or given her the 10 oz portion that was listed on the menu.  This looked more like 8 oz.   \n\nThe food was OK, but certainly not one of the better meals that we have enjoyed in Las Vegas.   The steak was very tender, but lacked flavor.  The peppercorn sauce did not save it.  The Lasagna was unremarkable.  There are too many exceptional Italian restaurants in Las Vegas to settle for such an average entree.  \n\nEntrees, a side of veggies, a shared antipasto and a shared desert, a glass of wine and 2 martinis came out to $280 including the tip.  The cost was competitive with the other many high end Strip restaurants we have visited over the years, but the meal could not compete with most of them."

            "review": "What would Frank Sinatra's favorite place to eat look like?\n\nSinatra is located in the Encore resort, adjacent and connected to the Wynn. Billed as a homage to Frank Sinatra and the only restaurant licensed to use his name, you are greeted at the entry by several of his awards including an Oscar and an Emmy. \n\nI had made reservations over the phone that afternoon but they had been lost. Luckily it was slow for a Friday night and we were able to be seated right away. The d\u00e9cor is all designed to make the patron comfortable from the word go. The best description I can give is of a late 60s elegant living room. Not posh or fancy or casual, just comfortable elegance. Along one wall are floor to ceiling glass walls with a patio and outdoor fireplace just outside, all to evoke feeling of being in someone's home, perhaps at a dinner party with some celebrity friends dropping by. There are large portraits of Frank throughout, all beautifully lit. Not museum or gallery lighting, more homey than that.\n\nThe wine list is a bit pricey but offers a few sub-100 dollar bottles and the one we chose was very enjoyable. The menu is simple but there are 4-5 selections in each category of appetizers, pasta, fish, and meat. We each ordered appetizers including Prosciutto and Melon, Blue Crab Salad, and Butternut Squash Soup. All were good and the portion sizes were good to generous. There were two entr\u00e9e specials but we decided to stick to the menu. The entrees took a while but we weren't in a hurry so it was fine. To be fair, the waiter had asked if we had any time restrictions such as a show and we said no. \n\nThe Lobster Risotto was a bit bland so we asked for and promptly received some lemon wedges. The pasta with sausage and peppers was simple but good. The gnocchi stuffed with ricotta was also simple but good. The major exception was desert. We ordered a gelato selection that was very good and a Tiramisu that was truly excellent. No matter how many times you've had Tiramisu in other restaurants, this one gives new definition to the word 'smooth'. After your first bite, you'll know what I mean.\n\nThe service was attentive but not over the top. You'll never have to ask for your water to be refilled, your waiter will always be easily accessible, and any special dietary requests such as food allergies or special preparations will be quickly and graciously handled. You will not have your refolded napkin waiting for you when you return from the bathroom. Your wine glass won't automatically be refilled every time it reaches the half way mark. \n\nAnd there in lies the rub of the restaurant. I suspect that many come here with expectations of grandeur at every turn. This is not and will never be a haven for foodies the world over. You will not get a Michelin 3-Star like impression of the selection or the food. You will not be hovered over by staff anticipating your every move, attending to you like royalty. \n\nAt the end of the day, this restaurant was designed to pay homage to one man. As Steve Wynn says on the first page of the menu, \"I think this is the kind of place he would dig\".  So what do you envision Sinatra's favorite evening with food and drink to look like? \nFor me, Sinatra was a man's man; a guy who enjoyed good food, good drinks and above all, good company. He enjoyed being comfortable with a certain easy elegance. That is the key to this place. Come with a desire to relax and enjoy an evening with a few good friends. Sit down, relax, get comfortable, and let it all happen. It's all designed to be comfortable and let you and your guests get to know each other and enjoy a special \nevening. I'm sure Frank had many an evening like this and I'm sure Steve Wynn is right; Frank would have dug this place."

We attended on a Saturday night without a reservation. We only had to wait about 30 minutes so we gambled a little while waiting. The hostess was so friendly and called a little earlier than we expected to be seated. \n\nOnce inside we were greeted by our server Pedro who was very friendly. When we asked for suggestions on meals he went into great detail about the most popular items and made everything sound so good. We decided to order Penette and the Lasagna. Both were very delicious and creamy. \n\nBefore our food was served we were given bread with yummy spreads and we ordered a few rounds of drinks. We started with the Sinatra Smash. I'm not a huge lover of whiskey but this drink was actually one of my favorites. While sipping on our drinks we decided to order a few appetizers, the Mussels and another one that had meatballs and cheese bread(I forgot the name of it). Both were pretty good but I liked the mussels better. They were served with a tomato sauce over it that was really good. Once we were finished with our appetizers dinner was served. The portion sizes aren't big so I'm glad that we did order an appetizer to help fill us up :) Halfway through our dinner Pedro served us with a complimentary serving of the chefs soup of the night. I'm not sure if they do that every night but it was a kind gesture and the soup was really creamy and light, it was a tomato basil soup. \n\nI loved this place and it was so nice to have a romantic dinner for our first night in Vegas.

            "review": "Sinatra is an excellent restaurant in Steve Wynn's new luxury tower suites hotel at Encore. I have the Yelp community to help steer me towards Sinatra, so thank you Yelp! Quick story; I was in Las Vegas for my mom's 65th birthday and were looking for a restaurant to help celebrate. Originally my aunt made reservations at Switch, another restaurant at Encore. However, I researched Switch on Yelp and saw that it had a 2 star review at the time =X I suggested we try somewhere else and I came across Sinatra on Yelp. The 4 1/2 star review seemed appealing and thus suggested Sinatra. To say the least, I was now nervous because the burden now came onto me. However, at the end of the evening, Sinatra did NOT disappoint, and my mom was very happy with her meal and experience =)\n\nOnto the details.\n\nThe ambiance and atmosphere at Sinatra was of class. A modern decor with a hint of old-Italian, combined with high ceilings, chandeliers, a huge portrait of Ol Blue Eyes himself, and a view of the flower garden created a feeling of elegance. Even the chairs were impressive, as if it were a throne itself. However, the beautiful hostess and staff helped each patron to their seats, and hence our night began.\n\nThe service at Sinatra is what really blew me away. Our waiter, Michael, was very amiable and down-to-earth. His portly stature, combined with his friendly personality, almost made me call him Uncle Mikey! Although you might expect a bit of pretentiousness at such a classy restaurant, Michael certainly dispelled that notion. He welcomed us to Sinatra and provided us with a quick description about the restaurant, as well as award-winning Chef Theo Schoenegger. As Michael described, Sinatra is obviously an Italian restaurant. However, Chef Theo approached the menu by taking classic Italian dishes and utilized reverse-culinary engineering to deconstruct the ingredients. He then implements his influence to these dishes to create a modern feel to classic Italian selections. That said, he elegantly went over the menu, giving a brief description of the dishes he recommends. After hearing Michael's monologue, I must say, I was excited!\n\nWhile waiting for our food to arrive, my dad brought a bottle of wine for the table, a 2005 Caymus Special Selection. I believe the corkage fee was around $40? After Michael took our orders, the sommelier (or wine steward) quickly came to our table and asked if we'd like our wine to be placed in a decanter. After saying yes, we observed this wine master at work, delicately pouring the wine from its original bottle into the decanter, then taking the bottle close to a lighted candle, to observe if any sediments were left. After a few minutes of allowing the wine to aerate and breathe within the decanter, she sampled the wine to taste for any tannins. Deemed ready. she brought our wine to the table, and after witnessing all that, it made the wine even more enjoyable! We actually just came from Napa Valley and consumed much wine during that trip (as expected haha), so my dad and I were having a conversation with her. She was very charming and answered many of our wine-related questions, so that was nice.\n\nOkay, onto the food. Sorry for the wait! For appetizers we decided to share amongst the 5 of us. We ordered two orders of each: the Assaggini Di Mare ( a quartet of the sea), the Polpettine (meatballs with polenta and mushrooms), and the Cappesante (seared Maine scallops). I didn't have much of the sea quartet, but I can definitely vouch for the Polpettine and Cappesante! The meatballs were bursting with flavor, as well as the scallops. Together with celery and kumquat fruits, the diverse combination with the scallops produced a refreshing taste to my palate, as the kumquat complimented the scallops well, while the celery acted as the bridge to put the two tastes together.\n\nI ordered the ravioli (with butternut squash, vanilla, and amaretto) for my second choice. I was a bit disappointed in the taste, for it was a bit bland for my palate. Perhaps it was the butternut squash? The vanilla foam on top, however, was a nice touch to the ravioli. My dad recommended the Agnolotti (with ricotta and herbs, parmesan sauce and chives), so maybe next time.\n\nFor my main course I ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb, along with a side of mashed Yukon Gold potato. Yum! The lamb was so tender and flavorful! The meat tasted so delicate, it was literally hanging by a thread off of the meat. The potato puree was an excellent compliment to the lamb, which was suggested by Michael. I'm not sure how Chef Theo did it, but you have to try the meat and see for yourself!\n\nFor dessert, I had the bread pudding with gelato. The contrasting flavors and temperatures made the end of my dining experience even more enjoyable!\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed my experience at Sinatra and highly recommend! This is no themed restaurant in a casino, this is fine Italian dining at its best!\n\nP.S. Sorry for the long review =X lol"

I liked it so much I went two nights in a row and ate the same thing, which I never do. The bone-in veal parmesan is fantastic. It is a pounded veal chop (very thin), lightly breaded and topped with just the right amount of cheese and a light red sauce. The chop literally covers the entire plate and you will be hard pressed to finigh it, but worth the try.\nAlso tried some pasta and some other appetizers and everything was delicious. Also an extensive wine list with some reasonably priced choices. I recommend the Avongnesi Vino Nobile di Montepulciano.\nVery good bread basket as well...save room for the veal!"

            "review": "A very upscale italian restaurant riding off the coattails of Frank Sinatra's image, Sinatra at the Encore is a good example of Italian haute cuisine.\n\nThe dress code is business casual, with almost all the men wearing jackets and boots and women also dressing up as well. However I went in with a clean pair of tennis shoes, nice jeans, a collared shirt under a sweater and it was fine.\n\nI was with family and we ordered two appetizers to share and  5 different entrees.\n\nBread is served and you get your choice of individual baguettes, raisin and nut bread, or fennel bread. All three weren't very impressive, fresh, and in fact were dissapointing. The presentation of the butter however was excellent as it was already warmed for spreading.\n\nThe appetizers:\n\nWe ordered the Tonnato, slivers of tuna fish served raw and with roe and drizzled with oil. It came with a side of sauce that was I believe made from the fish and it was absolutely incredible. It's highly aerated, and looks like creamy but has this nutty, beautifully subtle umami flavor to it. I'm currently on a mission to find out how to make it myself... it'll probably require some machinery to be honest to aerate it that perfectly.\n\nThe other appetizer was the polpettine, meatballs and cubes of polenta. The meatballs were soft but didn't have any special flavor to them. They were nice and crumbly without being mealy and were savory. The polenta was excellent though And I liked it's multiple textures. It had a visible crust topside and bottom, a firm, much lighter crust on its sides, but it had a very soft crumbly center that melts in your mouth.\n\nThe entrees:\n\nWe ordered the rigatoni, risotto, a pasta dish called the chitarra, and I had a dry-aged New York steak.\n\nThe rigatoni is made with a tomato-cream sauce with a hint of cheese, fresh basil, and big huge fresh shrimp. This dish was good, and this is a nice fancy restaurant, but it was overpriced to death. 30 bucks for rigatoni pasta that doesn't taste any better than supermarket Barilla is a bit of a dissapointment.\n\nThe risotto came with baked Main lobster and it was absolutely delicious. The lobster was succulent and sweet, the risotto was reduced and flavored just right to compliment it.\n\nThe chitarra is a spaghetti dish with \"hand-rolled spaghetti\" that again tastes like it was out of a box. At least it was a perfect al-dente. It's made in a cream-based wild-mushroom saute and seasoned with chives. They screwed up this dish by making it a bit too salty and we had it taken back. When it came back, it came back suspiciously quick (especially when we were told it would be remade), and I tasted it and realized they just dumped more sauce into it to dilute it. Must've been premade.\n\nAnd finally, to my steak. I had a gorgeous 14oz New York strip cooked medium rare, and it was exactly that, cooked in a broiler, great crust all throughout. The dry-aged beef was delicious, the flavor was exquisite as it let out more as I kept chewing. I especially loved how the fattier edges contrasted with the leaner center. Just great. It came with a side of potatoes and some wild mushrooms, but those were just a speck in the meal. My steak was fantastic.\n\nThe service here is nothing short of exemplary for a true fine dining restaurant. I would definitely come here again, but then again this is a town where there are just too many fine-dining restaurants to try to stick to one place. That, and overall I wasn't impressed with some of the food despite the prestige that seems to hype up this restaurant. I was happy with my meal, but for the price you pay here (think 40 bucks a person, average. Safely 50) you expect nothing short of a home run."

I expected something a little more nostalgic about Sinatra. After all that's where we were. I must say the bathrooms were fabulous. The food was the biggest disappointment. The carpacio was lacking in flavor and needed salt. The absolute worst entrees are the Osso buccu, that was extremely fatty and had virtually zero sauce to accent it. The risotto was ok. The sea bass was also just as bad,, It all lacked flavor. Please avoid this restaurant, unless your up for bland food, mediocre service and generic entrees.

The polenta sticks were crispy outside and creamy inside, and the meat sauce accompanying them put food I've had in Italy to shame. The second pasta dish we chose was a special that evening of tagliatelle with brown butter and black truffles that were shaved over the dish in front of us. I swear, the poor dog or hog that had to sniff out this truffle would have been dejected had he seen how much we were given.\n\nAgain, the strip is over-saturated with chains and mediocrity as we all know, but Sinatra was a complete departure from either.

He masterfully measured and perfectly mixed nearly a hundred drinks in front of me, never dropping even a grain of salt from a rim. His workspace and technique were immaculate. \n\nI enjoyed 3 Smashes, a delicious concoction where the main players are Gentleman Jack and muddled black berries.

I did give one additional star for providing separate checks.  Sinatra also added on tip, when Andrea's didn't.  Inconsistent policies.  \n\nWould not go back, nor recommend."

We were defiantly the youngest people in the restaurant, but it wasn't hard to see why. It has an elegant atmosphere, and in a city that never sleeps, it is much appreciated. I ordered the New York strip steak with cipollini onions. It was perfection! Cooked just like I asked, and oozing with flavor. Sinatra was the perfect pre-show dining experience."

Each staff member greeted us with a smile. Our server Dina provided excellent service and was supported by several associates that filled the water glasses and removed the empty dishes. Since we arrived prior to the restaurant opening, our experience started in the bar with some cocktails that were later moved to our table by the hostess.\nWe had a very comfortable 4 person table next to the life like portrait of Frank Sinatra. \nDinner began with a nice selection of breads. Our favorite was the date raisin combination accompanied with a basil flower butter spread. \nThe choice of appetizer was Panzanella which consisted of jumbo lump blue crab (really big pieces), brioche croutons, tomato and cucumber. Just a fantastic starter.\n\nThe entree of Branzino - Mediterranean Sea Bass was served on top of haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, tomato, yellow pepper emulsion salsa verde. This preparation of Branzino was the best I have ever experienced. The flavors were delightful and the fish filet was cooked to perfection.\n\nOur  other entree a 10 oz beef tenderloin filet with cipollini onions and mushrooms in a red wine sauce. The steak was prepared as requested well done. However for a well done steak this one was as tender and juicy as one with pink inside. A superb piece of beef. \n\nDessert was Tiramisu served in a bowl with large chocolate slices on top. It was moist and full flavored. \n\nThe finale was 2 complementary Petit Four. A dark and a light chocolate.\n\nLove it all. Service, Food, Atmosphere and Music. Next time we will dine on the outdoor patio. The patio looked inviting with the garden foliage and fireplaces"

We were celebrating our anniversary and Sinatra's was a great choice for us.\n\nThe dining room is beautiful and if it had been a bit warmer, I would have loved to dine out on the patio.  It certainly looked romantic there with the twinkling lights and the fireplace. But, the main dining room is a lovely room and is lit perfectly and the decor is classy.\n\nOur server Dina was warm, hospital, friendly and helpful. She made recommendations, but since I'd already looked over the menu online, I knew what I was having.\n\nWe started with a great Antipasto plate and a good Caesar Salad.  The Buffalo Mozzarella was fresh and delicious, as were the peppers and the meat selection.  The Caesar was good, but not awesome.  Though, I did enjoy the anchovy.\n\nFor a main course I had the Spaghetti and Clams and my wife had the Branzino.  The spaghetti was tasty and though the clams were tiny they were sweet and tender and there were lots of them.  It was the Branzino that was our favorite though.  It had a light delicate flavor and was prepared just right.\n\nWe had not planned on dessert, but since I casually mentioned there was some grit in the clams (a big no-no, but not really a big deal to me, since I liked the authenticity of them and to me the sand showed they were fresh.  As a kid we used to dig clams and a bit of grit was just part of the experience), they comped us the dessert and we had the chocolate Frank's Fedora.  It was very good, but we were full, so it was a bit much.\n\nWe are big fans of the Wynn/Encore and have eaten at the Country Club, Lakeside, SW, Botero before it became Jardin along with Allegro and Zooza Crackers and the Buffet. I think our favorite overall is Lakeside, but the new Jardin has sort of bewitched us as a upscale casual dining experience. \n\nOverall, we'd be happy to return to Sinatra since we enjoyed the whole experience, service, food and atmosphere."

If you like Frankie's music, this is your kind of place. And if you like BOTH Italian food AND Sinatra's music, this is a not-to-be-missed stop while in Vegas. \n\nOur party of three loves both. So we were fascinated with the Sinatra and authentic Rat Pack items on display at the restaurant entrance (intimate correspondance between Frank and Sammy, Frank and Wynn, and others, along with some of his many awards). We were seated promptly and given a window table overlooking the terrasse and outdoor fireplaces. It was a beautiful table, and the whole restaurant is elegant and understated - except for the humongous portrait of The Chairman dominating the main wall! \n\nOur waiter was superb, catering to my very-particular parents. My father wanted a basic pasta dish not on the menu; he was told sure! No problem, the chef can whip that up. Al dente, perfectly cooked, just as my dad liked it (he is hard to please). The waiter overheard my mother and I saying how we weren't sure we could finish a whole dish and he said he could gladly order us half portions of anything we liked. Wow, that was fantastic! It totally fit the bill! I ordered Sinatra's pasta with clams, and it was light and flavorful and the perfect portion. I forget what my mother had, but she loved it.\n\nI opted for just some coffee after the meal, but my folks had the creme brullee and the various scoops of gelato, the latter which was plated beautifully. They also put a few chocolates on the table, which was a lovely touch. We talked well into the next day about how lovely our dinner was here. Truly, a wonderful meal."

This place definitely captures that mood. However, the food was decent. It's better to make your own entree rather than picking from their menu, which doesn't have that much of a selection. They are pretty accommodating to your taste though. Dessert was probably the best part. The restaurant is kind of loud because it's so small so you can't hear the music playing or anything. The one thing that was a bit annoying was that no table has just one waiter. We were served by 5 different people, which was a pain. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll probably try something else."

My wife and I ate here around 9 on Saturday night without a reservation, and only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated.  We decided to sit outside since it was such a nice night.  We were seated right next to the fireplace, and they even had heat lamps going as well in case it got a little chilly.  It was a very romantic atmosphere, as the greenery outside was very nice and well kept.  For our meal, we split a caesar salad, which was very good, except for the fact that it comes in whole romaine leaves, so you have to cut it up.  This was only a minor inconvenience, as the salad was very good.  For our meals, I ordered the chicken parm, while my wife ordered the lobster risotto.  We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes.  My chicken parm was excellent, and the mashed potatoes were very good as well.  The lobster risotto my wife ordered was out of this world.  I'm not a big lobster fan, but this risotto was the best I have ever tasted.  Everything was very flavorful and well presented.  They give you a bread basket as well which was good.  We saved room for dessert and ordered the lemon cheesecake.  I'm not a big lemon fan at all, but our waiter advised us that there wasn't a big lemon flavor to it.  He was right, it was excellent and just the right size.  Overall, we will definitely be back here.  It was around $150 for 2 people, but well worth it.  Especially when it ends up getting comped down the line by the casino. :)"

Fine Italian Vegan dining? Check! Beautiful ambiance? Check! Soft background mood music? Umm... Yes, if you dig Sinatra music.\n\nUpon being seated by our hostess, I displayed my redneck charm by assisting her while turning the table to seat us. I didn't realize what she was doing as it's customary in these \"fine dining\" establishments to turn the table a bit to allow the lady to sit down, then turn it back. I thought she knew we wanted to sit on the same side and was turning it to accommodate us. Once she realized that was my thought, she quickly offered to seat us in a booth, side by side. Very nice of her.\n\nThe service other than the hostess was a bit substandard. I could see the dollar signs dimming in the eyes of our waitress when we told her we would be declining the drink menu. Yes, I know this was my first trip to Vegas where I stayed near completely sober... When we requested the Vegan menu, she knew our bill wasn't going to reach the point where her take would be $20 or more. From that point on, she offered the minimum amount of service possible while pasting on a phony smile.\n\nThe exquisite food all made up for it once it was rolled out. The Chick-non Marsala brought me back to childhood when my mom would fry up some chicken breast in the ol' electric skillet, using her patented blend of Lawry's seasoning. It was one of the most authentically meaty tasting dishes I've had in 16+ years. If that's your thing, this dish is for you! Although it was slightly on the salty side, that's ok for me since I crave sodium as much as my body craves water. This sumptuous chick-non patty was laid on a bed of my favorite pasta, gnocchi. This created a meal, that was nearly worth it's $33 price tag. I can really get used to eating smaller portions when they taste this amazing.\n\nThe beet salad was good with various types of beets laid out artfully in a rectangular platter. It was a little pricey at $14 but worth ordering if you're a fan of the beets like we are.\n\nThe Cioccolato we ordered for dessert was a cocoa powder covered delight. Definitely order a coffee with this one to soak up all that chocolate flavor. Just don't order a latte. I'm not sure they make them here. They brought out something resembling espresso with steamed milk, yet it wasn't a latte as I'm used to. Maybe go for their cappuccino instead since I think they would do a better job at that. This is a dessert that is meant to be savored, so if you're feeding your partner, take it slowly...\n\nSinatra is where the true \"High Rollers\" come to eat http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sinatra-las-vegas#Q_78_I5-KnUrRsAqFrJ1mg You won't have to worry about remembering any of ol' Blue Eyes greatest hits, as they'll play softly in the background, all while you dine in classy, elegant style. It's nice to see how the other half lives, if only for one meal.\n\nIf you have a special someone in your life that loves Italian food, but just so happens to be Vegan, take them to Sinatra. You may just make their day as special as they are themselves."

As I was eating I was thinking \"this is the best Italian food I've had in Vegas.\" Towards the end i realized it was actually on the list of best anywhere. First and foremost I have to compliment Roger, our waiter. This guy was present, engaged and overall a complete professional. He was great with recommendations and pacing out the meal. They take care of their guests here and I just felt good with the whole transaction, even though it is pricey, there is serious value. For example, the bread they bring, if you told me it was baked in a Brooklyn bakery that morning, it would be completely believable. Or another example the silverware was actual silver. The glass they pour your water in sat well in your hand. The little things, the details, were all there.  I started with the vegan Caesar salad, with lemon and capers instead of anchovies. It was amazing, clearly every rib of romaine was hand selected for crispness and quality. The Meatballs with Polenta Fries app was mouth watering and delicious. Amazing and worth the trip just for that app. Had a strong Chicken Marsala over gnocchi for entree and desert was the soothing Panna Cotta. Bam. The vibe of the restaurant is early 60's mod with warm pastels and floor to ceiling photos of Ole Blue Eyes. Really interesting decor, they have one of Frank's Academy Awards next to the hostess station, along with a Grammy and an Emmy. If they can get a Tony it will be an EGOT. So yeah...

When I saw Encore had a place dedicated to the Chairman of the Board, I immediately thought, \"I must eat there!\"\n\nThe atmosphere didn't disappoint in the slightest. The first thing you see upon walking in is Frank's actual Oscar, Emmy, and Grammy awards (very cool!) as well as some of Steve Wynn's personal memorabilia harkening to the memories he shared with Frank. They have jazz standards on the sound system and old Sinatra movies on a TV over the bar. While I was there, Guys and Dolls was playing and then it switched over to From Here to Eternity. The restaurant is further complimented with giant, wall-sized pictures of Sinatra. So far, the place was definitely living up to my expectations.\n\nWhat I didn't expect, however, was how good the food would be...\n\nAppetizer: Carpaccio tuna. Light, delicious, almost melted in your mouth. Even if you're not a big fan of sushi, you will enjoy this dish. \n\nMain Course: Chicken Saltimbocca. This was a whole breast of chicken on the bone, with prosciutto baked around it, served on a bed of spinach.  The chicken was juicy and the prosciutto was fantastic. As a side dish I had the gnocchi, which was actually kind of a let down. It was too overdone and as a result was way too soft and mushy. \n\nDessert: Tiramisu. Probably one of the best exampled of tiramisu I have ever had. Light, airy, and yet filling. \n\nAll in all, I had a great time at Sinatra.

Mr. Wynn goes above and beyond that he has the highest quality of both food and ingredients in throughout his resorts. \n\nI had the scallops for dinner, they were ok. They need to improve on the scallops.\nMy wife had the ciopinno, and I had it during a previous visit. That dish is a must have... it is to die for.\n\nAll of the staff were on the highest standards of service.\n\nI will always go to Sinatra when I go to Vegas. I only stay at the Wynn Resort because it is the finest in the region.\n\nMr. Wynn doesn't play games... He is the Walt Disney of adult Disney...VEGAS! He wants nothing but the best for his visitors."

The food is definitely Italian and the best I've had in a long time. The ambiance provides for a very romantic evening with someone you love. Both my husband and I enjoyed our evening immensely. We'll definitely return. If you want to try something fun, try the Sinatra Smash at this restaurant. Other establishments in the Wynn Hotel say they can replicate it, believe me when I say they can't. \n\n\nVisited July 2013"

Extremely wonderful service from the moment we stepped in to the moment we had to run out so we wouldn't be late for our show. \n\nThe drinks were delicious. My lemon drop was made exactly how I like it...on the sweeter side... And the house wine was wonderful (pinot). \n\nWe were given an assortment of bread that included sourdough, raisin, baked Parmesan and real bread \"sticks\". Also, we were given two spreadable mini cups of deliciousness. One was salted (delicious) butter and the other was a pur\u00e9e of yumminess...I can't remember, but I'm picky and it was fabulous. \n\nThe Caesar is a real Caesar salad. Anchovies and full cuts of lettuce perfectly dressed with delicious large croutons. I was in Caesar salad heaven. \n\nMy mom and I each got the lobster tail over el dente risotto with mushrooms and asparagus. Do I even need to go on...every ounce of the main course was amazing. I savored every bite. \n\nNext time, we would like to order an espresso with a dessert...we just did not have the time :(\n\nWe realized we were cutting it extremely close to our 7pm showtime and unfortunately had to run like bandits. The server was quick to bring us our bill and a plate of goodies I wanted to dump in my purse...but that's not classy. ;) \n\nWe knew where we were dining and decided not to worry about the prices. It was expensive, yes, but worth every single penny. \n\nIf I could give it 10 stars, I would."

We had a beautiful ceramony earlier that day, and we were ready to splurge. \nI ordered my favorite wine, a crisp pino griegio, and my handsome husband ordered a beer.

The service was absolutely amazing. \nAt the end of our meal, our waitor brought us chocolates and caramels with \"congratulations\"  written on the plate out of chocolate syrup. We were so touched.

It is classy, upscale, romantic and peaceful. They play Sinatra music (of course) inside and on the patio. The restaurant is very old school and cozy; even the outside is cozy with fireplaces (although they were off when we dined there since it was a warm evening). \n\nOur waiter was his team excellent; very nice and very attentive. He was also incredibly accommodating; I couldn't decide between the halibut because I loved the presentation with gnocchi and mushrooms, or the scallops because I prefer scallops to halibut , so he let me do the scallops with the halibut presentation! \n\nI highly recommend dining outside; it is a beautifully landscaped, intimate setting. \n\nGet the crab panzanella app and scallop entree!"

Our servers were prompt and very professional and we never had to ask for a thing. Our head waiter Suzanne was phenomenal! She was so warm and friendly and made some amazing suggestions. We had the veal parm and it literally melts in your mouth. The side dish special for that night was fresh pasta with parm and table side shaved truffles. It was heavenly. Very rich though so I'm glad we did it as a side and not an entree. We finished with dessert, (a chocolate shaped fedora), a cappuccino and a little Sinatra Jack Daniels which Suzanne also recommended. The veal parm was truly the best I've ever had. The pork chop was a little dry, but as the veal was the size of a plate, there was plenty to share, but you won't want to. The decor is very cool so take the time to look at some of the pics on the wall. All of the staff had helpful suggestions as to where to pose for the best pictures. There are 4 tables outside as well, if you want a more romantic ambiance."

However if you go on vacation / business retreat with your own comfort in mind, you should probably go else where. The staff is rude and dismissive.  They have a total lack of class and interaction skills.  When we made reservations for this restaurant, they stated that they require collared shirts and nothing further.  However when we made it to the front, we were immediately refused service as my son had Tommy Bahamas shorts and a Burberry Polo (Imagine that....it was 119 degrees this past weekend).  The so-call restaurant manager had come out the front reception area, and stated that he would need to check with the hotel's senior management (Really....Over a 7 Year old?) if this could be permitted.  The manager walked behind a door behind reception, but I could see his refection in the glass, he just stood there and looked at his watch.  Five minutes later he stated that he could do nothing and he hated to loose out business but this came down from the top...no shorts for your 7 year old.  Mind you at this same time a lady in a tank mini dress made her way on in.  The manager told us that this was our fault and that his staff reads the reservations requirements from a script.  As they were on speaker phone when the reservations were made and not one of our company staff members heard this we are calling a spade a spade.  We had informed the hotel management of the situation, and they responded by telling (I think his last name was Fox), are you calling our hotel staff liars?....seriously!\n\nThese actions occurred in front of our office staff and was so classless we barely could put together words to articulate just how poorly restaurant acted. \n\nThese guys are the worst....and the fact that they are so willing to play games over something so petty is beyond reason.  Steve Wynn needs to restaff. Bottom line, I don't know how good the food is, but I would sooner recommend seeing the soup Nazi!\n\nMAKE A STATEMENT TO THE WYNN AND DO NOT PUT UP WITH THIS GARBAGE!"

The apps were delicious and the Caprese and Caesar were up with my all time favorites.  I consider myself a lasagna and chicken parm expert.  The best lasagna ever was in little Italy NY and at Sinatra it was a solid B+.  The chicken parm (not on the menu) was an A for sure.   The service, wine list, ambiance and general ease of use make this an overall amazing experience.  The best Italian I have ever eaten was at the now closed Parma Ristorante here in Vegas.

And this particular evening at Sinatra was just that. \"To me, this is magic,\" said my Dad, a rabid Sinatra fan, who requested we dine here for a special dinner during his visit this weekend. He loves good food but isn't really a foodie per se, so we don't do many fine dining meals when it's just him and Mom isn't with us. So, I confess  -- although I love Wynn and Encore-- I was a tiny bit skeptical about his choice since we hadn't planned on a really elaborate dinner during this visit. Although I'd met the chef -- the brilliant and charming Theo Schoenegger -- and knew he was extraordinary I was concerned the menu items might a bit rich and heavy for my current palate/diet. I was also concerned it would be crazy expensive, and Dad insisted on treating.  I'm thrilled to report I was dead wrong! We had an amazing evening and ordered from the special summer menu (3 courses for $69) We even found a fabulous bottle of wine for under $40 - which was a pleasant surprise. (Loved Drew, the wine manager!) Dina, our server, has been there since the restaurant opened and she made our dining experience incredibly enjoyable - perfectly paced. She was very accommodating to a couple of special requests I had, such as ordering sauces/dressings on the side for my fish and salad. The bread basket was a standout.  I rarely do bread, but the cheese breadsticks were particularly amazing. Dad opted for the Osso Bucco, a caprese salad and panna cotta with fruit for his dessert. He said the veal was the best he's ever had. Husband ordered a filet, a crab appetizer salad and tiramasu for dessert. All outstanding. He's not even a mashed potato fan but loved the potatoes served with his steak. I had the fish special with asparagus, sauce on the side, and a salad appetizer. All awesome. For dessert I opted for the coconut sorbet with fruit from the vegan menu. The atmosphere is incredible and special props to the resort's design team, too. (Roger Thomas is brilliant - I'm assuming he was involved!) The restaurant is beautifully designed with comfortable chairs and stunning color combinations, along with high ceilings.  The temperature inside the restaurant is perfect! I wore a sleeveless dress and was comfortable throughout our meal -- and I'm often freezing. And the Frank Sinatra music playing throughout the evening was a lovely treat. Just the right volume.  Also - there's a lovely restroom immediately outside the restaurant. (I'm far from lazy but can't stand going to a nice restaurant and having to venture far into the casino to find the ladies room)  Our busser, Jorge, was delightful, too.  On our way to the restaurant I called with a question about parking -- I wanted to self park and wanted to park somewhat close so I didn't have to walk too far in my ridiculously high heels. I was wowed that one of the hotel operators checked with the restaurant to get my number and made a special effort to call me back and advised me on where to park.  That's Wynn/Encore caliber service."

            "review": "Fourth night of honeymoon, fourth great dinner.  After watching La Reve, we made our way over to Sinatra at the Encore.  The first thing that you notice while approaching is the Black and Gold Sinatra sign above the walk in entrance.   It really helps to set the mood of the evening, and like his music, the joint is classy.  We were seated within 5 minutes, even though the restaurant was full and we were 20 minutes early. \n\nThe chairs were wide comfy wooden loungers, and the decor reminded me of a Godfather movie set adorned with large oils of Sinatra, his music playing in the back ground, with reddish orange hues and elaborate rope chandeliers reminiscent of  a high end restaurant from the 50's.  Perfect for the Chairmen of the Board.  A spot where wise guys would come and at the end of the meal say \"Put it on my tab,\" the owner rightfully knowing that if he asked them to pay, he might be sleeping with the fishes in Lake Las Vegas.  \n\nDressed for the affair, I was wearing a suit, and my bride looked so good in her black dress and new Manolos, if she had been on the menu, I would have ordered her.  I know, I know, I just got married, give me a break.  \n\nWe started with a bottle of bubbly, I don't recall the name, but at about $95 it was reasonably priced, and lasted us through the meal.  We began with two aps, a crab salad and an octopus in marinara sauce.   The dish was simple and straight forward with lots of white crab meat tossed in a mayonnaise based dressing.  The octopus dish was very interesting and something that I would never have conceived in my kitchen at home.   However when I think of it now, a nice tomato gravy with slowly simmered tender pieces of octopus and capers, not only sounds but tastes really good.\n\nOf course the service was exemplary.  We had one of the older waiters who said that he had been with the restaurant since it opened 2 years ago.  He recommended that I have the Ossobucco, paired with a glass of cabernet...sounded good to me, and my wife decided on the chicken wrapped in prosciutto served with spinach.  Both dishes were high quality.  My plate looked like something out of a French cook book circa 1945, and had flavors of red wine, pot roast, and sherry which paired nicely with the recommended wine.  My wife's chicken was perfectly cooked, and the prosciute helped to impart a smoky flavor while keeping the bird tender and moist.  \nFor dessert,  we ordered the Tiramisu which was also good, but felt a little pre made, meaning that it came served in a martini glass, and seemed a little wet for our tastes, like it had been made yesterday, or even 2 days prior.  Still not bad, and a great way to finish the meal which after the  still water, and the bubbly, 2 aps, 2 main courses, a glass of wine, and a beer, came out to an obese price tag of $380 tip included.   \n\nA great restaurant, but truthfully I felt a little overlooked.  When I made my reservations here, I had said that it was my honeymoon.  That should at least warrant a small congratulations dessert, or perhaps a shot of limoncello, or something to celebrate with.  Botero, two nights prior went above and beyond the call to make us feel welcomed, and I still remember our sommelier and our waiter's name.  This was not the case at Sinatra.   \n\nThat being said, you should defiantly eat here, just don't expect the staff or the waiter to do anything extra for your special occasion.  With a restaurant based on a guy like Sinatra, I expected just a little more generosity.  However, I would like to congratulate Mr. Wynn for really capturing the true essence of the man, and for making a restaurant that I know Frankie would have been proud to put his name on."

Upon arrival we sat at the bar where they had High Society playing on a large flat panel above the bar. It was a playful atmosphere and I enjoyed looking out to the patio area that had fireplaces, trees wrapped in white lights as well as heat lamps. Everyone inside & out seemed to be having a fun evening. \n\nShortly after arriving we were promptly seated in a large dining area~ not very intimate as I was hoping but nice nonetheless. Our server was very efficient in taking our order which included the Polpettine (meatballs & polenta fries) appetizer for my husband and the Panzanella con Granchio (lump blue crab, brioche croutons, tomatoes, cucumber with tomato fonduta) for myself. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meatballs and we were both surprised how much we enjoyed the polenta fries which I've never had before. My appetizer arrived looking much different than I visualized but I truly enjoyed the large pieces of blue crab as well as the tomato fonduta. We leisurely enjoyed our appetizers also partaking of the breadbasket & sipping our drinks. For our main entr\u00e9es my husband had the  Lasagne Bolognese that arrived in a oval tin and initially wasn't sure how to \"dig in\". However, once started he said it was a very flavorful lasagna and was very pleased with his selection. I had Frank's Spaghetti & Clams which was served in a bowl overflowing with clams. The clams were cooked to perfection - tender and not chewy & the pasta was al dente how I like it. The only thing that needed some \"help\" was the tomato garlic broth which was a bit too mild and needed a bit more seasoning. \n\nOur server  who seemed a bit overwhelmed with a very large party and several smaller parties did his best to be attentive however, he took my empty cocktail glass never asking if I would like another. So, I didn't get another scrumptious pear martini until we finished our meal. \n\nOnce the table was cleared the server brought a small plate of various chocolates, biscotti and a piece of caramel which was soft & melt-in-your-mouth yummy.  \n\nWe both very much enjoyed our experience and, if we find ourselves back at the Wynn, would certainly partake in another meal at Sinatra's."

The bar itself is very beautifully decorated, with vintage French lighting.  The bartender was very nice too and chatted with us before we got seated.\n\nIt was too cold to be seated outside, but if you ever have the opportunity, DO IT! The patio area is so lovely and surrounded by gardens.  We sat at the windows overlooking the gardens, and it was very romantic.\n\nTry the daily specials! I ordered the truffle ravioli (I am a truffles freak) which was at market price ($90).  Seriously, the best truffles and worth the splurge!  I got a kick out of the little white-gloved man who came to our table and shaved down some fresh truffles on my plate.\n\nIt is going to be an expensive night, but well worth it!"

The bartender brought me a sip of $15 per glass wine - the cheapest. I asked how much a bottle would be. $65! I had heard the osso bucco was good. Not for me at $50. We walked and ate at Magianno's , literally across the street. Same wine, same bottle, $32. Sinatras is for high rollers who get comped or tourist suckers. Save your money.

My YELP cherry that is...\n\nSinatra in the new Encore hotel in Las Vegas is hands down worthy of my first review, after much thought about which establishment would be my introduction to this community.\n\nI recently celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and I heard that Steve Wynn celebrated his birthday there a week prior with a host of celebrities and multi-millionaires including the \"Donald\" himself.  Anything good enough for the owner of the hotel is good enough for me.\n\nHere is the review...enjoy\n\nType: Sinatra's is a modern take on classic Italian.\n\nAtmosphere: The decor and ambiance can only be described as classic elegance.  The sounds of Sinatra filled the very large main dining room in a pleasant and subtle way and was by no means overbearing or too powerful.  I could easily enjoy conversation throughout dinner with my date.  Large chandeliers and a photo of Frank stood out in the main room.  I particularly enjoyed the high decorated ceilings and large windows that looked out into the patio dining and garden area.  The carpet was a little much, but with the amazing view of the garden and the delicious food in front of me my focus wasn't on my feet.\n\nStaff: We were greeted at the restaurant like we were VIPs and immediately shown to our table by the gracious hostess.  As fine dining should be various staff members were on point to take our order, bring our order, and refill our drinks.  Jonathan, our sommelier, recommended an amazing Italian wine (which name excapes me at the moment) based on what we told him we were looking for and it paired nicely with the Ossabuco.  The food was delivered with precision and immpeccable timing as our silverware was switched per course.  \n\nFood: AMAZING! Pretty much that describes the overall satisfaction from my dining experience.  3 choices of fresh baked bread were served along with butter and I must recommend the Asiago bread.\n\nFirst Course: Tonnata - blue fin tuna served \"carpaccio\" style with thin slices of tuna topped with finely selected seasonings.  The tonnata literally melted in your mouth and left your palette craving for more.\n\n*we ordered originally the Capisante - Maine diver scallops, but was informed from the waiter that the scallops were turned down by the kitchen due to receiving a poor quality batch.  I really appreciated this as this shows the high standard and quality control that Sintra has.\n\nEntree: Ossobuco \"My Way\" with risotto.  This also was pretty tasty and finely prepared.  The meat was cooked just right and the portion was generous.\n\nSan Pietro - John Dory fillet with gnochi.  Prepared nicely and the white fish was soft and left no hints of the \"fishy\" taste that is sometimes found with fish dishes.  The fresh fish was complemented nicely with the gnochi as well.\n\nMy favorite dish of the evening was the Ravioli.  The butternut squash ravioli was perfect and possibly the best pasta dish I have ever had!  The flavors of the squash mixed with the vanilla foam that was layered on top was pure heaven in my mouth. \n\nDessert: I was able to get quite a sampling of the desserts and I must say they were all pretty tasty.  The Bomboloni - warm little donuts filled with dark chocolate were amazing!\n\nI was very impressed with this restaurant and will definitely go back.\n\nSinatra would be proud..."

As I arrived at my dining table, there was a cute little card waiting for me on the table. I opened it up and it was a HAND-WRITTEN birthday card. I thought it was very sweet that the restaurant went out of their way to hand-write a birthday card for me...quite a memorable characteristic indeed. \n\nAs for the food...I could not believe that this restaurant has an entire vegan menu. I am not vegan, but am lactose intolerant and they were able to modify all dishes to meet my dietary needs. And all of the food spectacular! \n\nFor my starter, I ordered the beef carpaccio served with salsa verde, wild arugula, shaved parmigiano, and croutons. Excellent combination.\n\nFor my main course, I had the agnolotti filled with butternut squash and served with sage, parmesan, and brown butter. They made this dish completely dairy-free for me. I have seen a similar dish at several other restaurants, however I can never order it due to its high dairy content. I must say I was impressed with these accommodations. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered  the bomba al cioccolato made with Valrhona chocolate cake, raspberries and passion fruit sorbet. DAIRY FREE. This is the best vegan dessert I have ever  tasted in my life. It did not taste vegan at all...actually tasted quite normal :) The combination of the cake the with sorbet went perfectly together.\n\nThe ambiance is elegant and lovely. There are photos of Frank Sinatra all around with charming Sinatra music playing in the background. They also gifted me and my entire party with Holiday Frank Sinitra CDs!! Can you believe that? We all left with Sinatra CDs! If thats not going over the top...then I don't know what is. The bathrooms are also beautiful. The bathrooms are technically the Encore hotel bathrooms, but regardless they have HAIRSPRAY and hand lotion in BOTH the men's and women's powder rooms. And the hand lotion smells amazing!\n\nFinally, I must comment on the service as it was outstanding. We dined as a party of 6 and asked our server to provide each of us with individual itemized receipts (for reimbursement purposes). The server did not complain or have any problems with our request. In fact, he remembered each of our items and was happy to fulfill our request.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Sinatra in Las Vegas. I had an absolutely phenomenal dining experience!"

To die for. \n\nI can't even articulate the rest; for if I do, I may cry of sadness that I am no longer eating it. Just go. Seriously."

In fact, I ate so much of it that I was no longer interested in having it - ever.\n\nTherefore, it was quite a surprise to me when, upon browsing through the food recommendation section of the Encore Hotel & Casino entertainment book this past weekend, that my gaze settled upon a little place called \"Sinatra\" - and I wanted to go there!\n\nMy date and I arrived and of course, since it was a Sunday, I didn't make reservations. There simply isn't a need and this was in fact evident based on the number of folks there.\n\nFor pre-dinner drinks we selected The Dream - a signature cocktail - and a glass of sauvignon blanc. Nothing special here.\n\nI've been on an appetizer kick lately, sampling only appetizers. I feel this allows me to sample the most items and I can also closely meter how much food I'm eating. \n\nWe started with a lovely basket of parmesan breadsticks, parmesan flatbread, and whole wheat bread. It was good, but honestly, nothing special. \n\nAfter we moved on to the mains. \n\nPolpettine - housemade meatballs with polenta fries. The housemade meatballs were OK. Ikea meatballs are slightly better IMO, but....THE POLENTA FRIES! They were soooo good. In fact, I would order this dish again in a heartbeat just for them.\n\nFrank's Clams Posilipo - clams in tomato sauce with garlic and oregano. Delicious. Exactly what I expected. Flawlessly executed. \n\nMy date got the Agnolotti, which is small pasta pockets filled with bufala ricotta, herbs, asparagus sauce. It was rich, but truly sublime. Small pockets of pasta, with a delicate sauce, that explode perfectly in your mouth as you eat them. \n\nDue to the fact that we had bottle service somewhere after we declined to eat further, but I can only imagine. I expect to be back here in December when I return to the Encore."

We've been told that the menu are all of Frank Sinatra's favorite foods.\n\nWe've dined here many many times.  Before we moved to Vegas, we would fly in to dine here on special occasions.  \n\ntart with one of their signature drinks...so original and refreshing.  \n\nHubby will usually have the Veal Parmesan or the Pennette.  Both authentic and delicious.  The Veal is massive and super tender.\n\nI'm a fish girl so it's usually the scallops or branzino.  Both incredible.  They have an extensive vegetarian menu too.  The couscous with ratatatouille is out of this world.\n\nThe service here is impeccable. We always enjoy listening to how they describe the specials.  These professionals could make anything sound incredible. Always attentive and friendly.  \n\nFor dessert, the lemon cheesecake with raspberry sorbet is my favorite and is as beautiful as it is delicious.  Make sure to ask about the crostata of the day.  They are always fresh and perfect.\n\nThis is perfect for a business dinner, special occasion or if you just want to be treated to an outstanding dining experience!"

Pillars of funky white shapes and classic black and white tiles will have you wondering if you stepped into the past and landed in the retro decades. Sinatra's \"awards\" are plastered on the walls and pictures/posters of The Voice is everywhere.  \n\nFood is absolutely divine. The caprese was drenched in olive oil and the mozzarella was so soft and moist. We also had their poleptinne which included marinara saturated meatballs and grilled polenta. \n\nMy main course was the turbot with seared mushrooms. This dish was so delicate and full of flavor. The turbot is exquisitely tender and you can feel each piece of fish separate on your tongue palate. I highly recommend this dish to anyone who plans to pay a visit to this tribute restaurant. \n\nSpeaking of tribute, they were definitely paying their respects to The Voice. His melodious tunes were crooning to me throughout our dinner. But beware, you can barely hear \"Fly me to the Moon\" because it's so busy. But it is definitely in the background somewhere. \n\nFriendly service, wonderful food, and intimate setting. Why would you NOT want to come here?"

I'd give 5 stars if not for him. From what I could see around us, this waiter looked like the exception, not the rule. Other tables appeared well attended. Our group was 10 and everyone complimented what they ordered. Three of us had the chicken parm and it was really delicious. Tip, order pasta on the side. It does not come with it. Some had steak and one had the lobster risotto, again all said good things about their dish. A few ordered dessert, the cake and ice cream lollipops, which several enjoyed. I ordered fresh berries and it was a nice assortment of very fresh fruits. The blackberries were the size of my thumb! The atmosphere was quite nice without being stuffy or pretentious. We sat near the windows overlooking a beautifully manicured garden. Dress code is men just need collared shirts and dress jeans are allowed. No shorts. Based on the group's compliments, I think everyone would recommend it and return themselves."

Our wait staff was fantastic and the food was so delicious - we brought some very special wines, including a 2007 Sinatra Napa wine that they no longer make - and the staff was thrilled to see that bottle.   They made great recommendations for the meal to go with our wines and it was truly a memorable meal.   And at dessert, the plates were personalized for our celebrations.

You definitely want to dress nice (don't even think about Jeans guys!), but they do not require a jacket. \n\nThe interior has a sort of Mad Men 50's feel with many modern touches, especially in the ceiling and chandelier fixtures. The napkins are so nice you almost feel bad wiping your hands on them. The staff is probably the most professional service staff I have ever been serviced by. This was not just a unique trait of Sinatra, but of the entire Wynn and Encore hotel complex.\n\nSinatra music pumps softly through the speakers, a good mix of his tunes and adds to the atmosphere. The restaurant has a beautiful outdoor area with a fireplace and a garden.\n\nThis was a birthday dinner for me and they had little touches waiting for me such a hand-written birthday card, free birthday cookies on a plate that said \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate.\n\nDon't worry, the waiters won't come out wearing sombreros singing happy birthday or anything.\n\nThe restauraunt offered a 3 course prix fixe menu from 5:30-6:30 that we took advantage of, the value was fantastic compared to the standard menu prices ($40-50 entrees are the norm). Chef Theo Schoenegger makes amazingly delicious dishes. I don't know where the kitchen finds their mushrooms, but the mushroom risotto was spectacular, as was the chicken marsala. \n\nThe deserts of Tiramasu and Gelato were really really good. The chocolate gelato was one of the most delicious examples of chocolate I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.\n\nOverall, this was a stellar dining experience and an extremely memorable and happy Birthday dinner. This is an italian restauraunt not be missed in Vegas."

Absolute perfection in haute cuisine: food, ambiance, service all five-star.\n===\n\nI am honored to review the heavenly nirvana that is Sinatra at Encore. That a restaurant could be so well composed only two weeks after opening is otherworldly. Clearly the gods have shone on this mansion of Olympus.\n\nReservations are required. Dress is extremely up; don't embarrass yourself by even walking into this hotel without a jacket or donned in high European couture: the splendour of the decor absolutely demands your highest respect. Gloriously beautiful butterfly mosaics guide your way highlighted by the RED red chandeliers above (did I mention that they are red?). You may pass by some disappointed fanny-packed, windbreakered walk-ups, turned away without a reservation as you take your seat atop a stool, one of just seven at the bar. Old blue eyes is serenading you as you are about to embark on the swankiest dinner of a thousand lifetimes.\n\nI ordered my Dubonnet Manhattan and was proud to be the first pour from the newly unsealed bottle. History. Should have been real cherries, but I'm too overwhelmed to fuss. Hostess arrives to escort us... Hmm, not what I'd expect for the look in a swanky Maitre'd but again, I'm not fussing. I get to sit under this gigantic portrait of the man himself.\n\nEvery detail is supreme. The royal orchids table arrangement and linen-topped oil lamp shade masking the flickering flame within. The embroidered artwork of butterflies on silk napkins. The lushly textured orange tablecloth (how can I have a shirt made from that material?!?) and the orange piping framing the absolutely white seat cushions.\n\nThe wine list is eclectic and mostly complete. A wonderfully huge Amarone awaits our dessert and just champagne cocktails for now.\n\nLobster raviolis are absolute perfection. Mixed with buttery tomatoes, so fine. The ossobucco melts in your mouth, the marrow the finest I have ever had. I was so deeply moved that I wished hard that I might be able to pay homage to the chef; I was lucky enough to be able to present my thanks personally, but that's a story for the memoirs.\n\nThey even made my favorite dessert to accompany the vanilla gelato. Strawberries, mint and balsamic vinegar. Was there a hint of pepper? \n\nI can't wait to go back."

Friendly service and portions large enough to share, had the chicken parm. a have to say it was baked to cheesy perfection.  Atmosphere inside was nice, but patio looked better.  Price was average for the casino. Cons for me were a limited menu and the seating inside was very crowded kinda like a cafeteria.  Great place, but I expected a bit more."

After I informed the waiter I was still working on the my food he placed my meal back on the table even after putting all the other dirty forks and knives and my wife's dish on top of it. Ofcourse I said never mind I don't want that anymore and asked for a coffee. The waiter gave me a cup and spilled the rest all over me burning my arm! In the end, you get a I'm sorry from the manager."

The ambiance is very classy and romantic with beautiful lighting and music filling the restaurant.  Our waiter promptly arrived to take our order and answered any questions we had on the menu. They really make every dish sound amazing! Finally decided on the chicken Parmesan and my friend had their linguini. We tried some of each other's dishes and loved both! Worth every penny. You can really taste the quality that goes into the food."

There is a picture of a young Steve Wynn and Frank Sinatra together on the front of the menu as an homage to Frank. The restaurant plays Sinatra's music throughout the entire dining experience. It is a great place to bring a hot date and/or have a nice romantic dinner with your significant other. \n\nWe first started with wine, but since we had already had some drinks earlier, we settled on a half size bottle of the Duckhorn Merlot from Napa Valley. Oh, it was so delicious. Then, we received our amuse bouche along with a warm bread basket. The only thing that was funny about the bread basket was the two spreads that they gave us. The bread runner gave each of us a different spread, but we moved it to the center where we can both share the spreads. Finally, the Ossobuco came out, which was my main entree. It consisted of braised veal ossobuco, risotto milanese and gremolata. I thought the risotto milanese was somewhat heavy with all the cheese, but the ossobuco was on point as the veal was quite tender. \n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience. Most of the men at the restaurant were wearing suit jackets which added to the sophistication of Sinatra. Come dressed and ready to eat well."

A beautiful setting - the art in the dining room is gorgeous and the bar is beautifully lit and sparkly.  Great music (Sinatra and associated Rat Pack tunes of course).  And fabulous people watching.  Get the Lobster Risotto - i swear there must have been the meat of a 1 lb lobster in there.  And an amazing caprese with heirloom tomatoes of many colors.  My favorite dinner in Vegas!"

In fact, the entire staff that we interacted with were great.  Everyone was smiling and helpful.  \n\nThe food was Ah-may-zing.  I had cioppino, one friend had one of the specials (I think it was filet and truffled mashed potatoes that will haunt your dreams--they are that good), and the other had the fish special (I forget only because I was so in love with the cioppino).  \n\nWe sat on the patio, the weather was beautiful, and the service was perfect.

It was one of my favorite restaurants I have ever been to - not only in Vegas but anywhere. Wife and I are Sinatra fans (who isn't?) but even if you are not the food, service and overall restaurant are absolutely top notch. We had Caesar salad, Pork Chop special and Linguini with clams - all were delicious and well presented. We were celebrating our 50th birthdays, had a corner table, were not rushed and the service is incredible. Our server Thomas was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was truly the best. He was so personal that we felt like we knew him forever. When in Vegas, Sinatra restaurant is a MUST."

While the price tag doesn't always make it possible, I'm a total foodie in the making and my experience at Sinatra's was fantastic! The service was impeccable and accommodating and the lobster risotto was so perfectly prepared that I nearly lamented having it my first night away because everything else I ever ate between there, California, and back in New York has paled in comparison (and I've tried three other lobster risottos at various restaurants!).\n\nMy father had the lasagna and all but inhaled it whereas we all split some appetizers. I fully recommend loosening the hold on your wallet so that you can loosen your belt when your stomach is thanking you!\n\nPlus, the ambiance (as a fan of ol' Blue Eyes) is totally worth it alone! \n\nShame on you Sinatra's for spoiling me, and I mean that in the most loving and grateful way possible."

This place is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of fine dining and the service is impeccable. You are treated exquisitely, in an utmost refined manner from the moment you step foot into this establishment and when they proclaim that the food is imported, they certainly deliver what they profess. The dining experience here was probably on my top five list of most remarkable restaurants ever encountered. If you are looking for loud music and bar-hopping that is the typical Las Vegas scene, this is not the place to dine. This place is one of the few, if not the only restaurant in Las Vegas where you can actually enjoy a sophisticated meal in a tranquil setting amongst fellow patrons who share a similar taste. It's truly a gem."

It was definitely on the expensive side but worth every penny. \n\nI wore a dress and my husband wore a suit to honor Frank by being dapper. Overall, people were dressed quite nice although he was the only one with a suit jacket on. Just don't wear short and sandals (duh!). \n\nI thought the restaurant was gorgeous! It was dramatic without being too overly done up like other parts of Encore and Wynn. The chairs were comfortable and we had a nice view. And of course the music was great. :-) \n\nOur waiter was amazing and there was a sommelier on hand. \n\nWe started with a special appetizer of fettuccine in truffle butter sauce with a huge serving of fresh shaved black truffle on top. It was like a little bit of heaven in my mouth. I had agnolotti (ricotta filled pasta) with spinach sauce which was lovely. But the real star of the show was my husband's tagliata (rib-eye). It was the best steak of the week (and we had many steaks at many steak places). My dinner was really good, but his was amazing. \n\nI would definitely recommend Sinatra and I would recommend the rib eye!"

I try to stay away from ordering pasta dishes but I heard how good this was and was glad I did. \n\nFor entrees we had the Veal Parm and Branzino. Both were excellent. The portion size was very generous. The Parmesan was nice and thin with a delicious cheese and sauce. The branzino sauce was perfect and was served over potato and veggies. \n\nWe had the tiramisu for desert.  I am a big tiramisu fan and order it at least once a week. It was served in an oversized martini glass. Once again the portion was generous and taste was exactly what I hoped. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the price. If price is not a concern then definitely make plans to go here."

I really wished I had taken some. I will next visit, I promise. \n\nOur table started off with a special appetizer of Fettuccine Alfredo - $44.00 if my memory serves me correctly - with fresh truffle shavings that were grated right in front of us. I fiddled with my napkin as I tried to keep my paws from reaching up to take the delicious and rare dark truffle from our exceptional server's hand and run away with it to the nearest drive-thru wedding chapel. \n\nAfterwards the vegan menu was presented to me and I ordered a delicious Penne Arrabiata with tender noodles and a lightly spiced sauce ($24.00 or $26.00 I believe).\n\nOthers at the table enjoyed the Branzino (grilled Mediterranean sea bass) $49.00. the Veal Parmigiana $49.00 and the Tagliata (prime bone-in rib chop) $56.00. Everybody was very pleased with the preparation of their meats and the accompaniments. I see others complaining of the prices. The prices are no different than what you would pay for a fine-dining experience in Santa Barbara or Los Angeles, Sinatra is pure luxury in every sense."

The polenta fries were crispy on the outside and so creamy on the inside. The polenta complimented the meatballs perfectly. \nI chose the Risotto with main lobster and the husband opted for the Lasagna Bolognese. Both of the dishes were delicious and very flavorful.

I have to say that I really love most of the restaurants at the Wynn/Encore and I have been to all of them.\nDespite the beautiful bar and grand atmosphere, the food was a disaster.\nMy friend got meatballs so chewy that could have bounce up the ceiling a few times. The sauce was thick and flavorless.\nI risked getting the spaghetti and clams and I regret it.\nFor $35 I got an overlooked Italian nightmare. The idea of adding red sauce to the dish wasn't really smart, it overpowered the clams making you taste only garlic. The pasta was so over cooked that I basically ate none of it.\nThe eggplant parmigiana was cold and messy.\nWe didn't dare ordering dessert.\nI'd go back only to seat at the bar and watch Old movies, I guess that's the most you can make out of Sinatra."
