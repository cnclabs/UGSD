This must be an Asian (Japanese, Indian, Chinese etc) restaurant because the menu had sashimi, to pork bun, oysters, to rice, etc.  Would def eat here again.  Like the ambiance and water.  Didn't go past the bar so no idea what the rest of the restaurant looks like."

Its really awesome because they have glass windows to their kitchens and you can see them preparing your food. Not only that but to my understanding  they actually have a different kitchen for every ethicity of food with cooks from the country. How Awesome is that!"

            "review": "My wife and I are vegetarian so I emailed SENSI Executive Chef Roy a month prior to our visit to ask if he could accommodate us because their regular menu that I found on-line did not reveal a lot of vegetarian options. He responded almost immediately with a list of about ten vegetarian dishes. I followed up with: \"They all sound wonderful, can you create a vegetarian multi-course tasting for us?\" Of course he said yes and on August 7 he served us a seven-course meal; each dish paired with wine. The experience was phenomenal. Highlights for us included his Melon Salad with Smoked Peaches, Sweet Corn Risotto with Fava Beans, and English Pea Soup with Smoked Morel Mushrooms and Cherry Tomatoes but all seven courses were stellar. Because our meal was a special request, he copied his management staff, so everybody was on board with what we were doing and the entire process was seamless and perfect. Service was friendly and attentive. The restaurant is gorgeous and the kitchen is glassed in so that you can see the kitchen staff cooking, but they can see you too. Each time we took a first bite of a dish, we saw Chef Roy watch us for our expression. I think he was happy. I know we were."

            "review": "Easily one of the top 10 meals I've had in my life. \n\nFirst off, I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. It's quiet and private so you can have a meal and hold a conversation. My boyfriend and I ate here before seeing O. \n\nI wasn't sure how the food would be. It says Asian Fusion but I would describe it more as having Asian, Italian, and Indian food. I didn't really see genres fused together. I had the prix fixe menu for $60 which comes with an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. This is a great deal since appetizers are $15-25 and the entrees are $30-50. \n\nFor my appetizer, I had crispy shrimp. At first, I was like \"okay, fried shrimp... how great can it be?\" after the waiter noted it was one of their signature appetizers. They use huge tiger prawns which are fried to a crisp. There's a sauce that goes with it but I can't recall what was in it. For my entree, I got the sea bass. It comes in a foam sauce. The sea bass was super tender and fell apart so easily with the touch of my fork. For dessert, I had this chocolate hazelnut bar. Loved it! They paired it with caramel ice cream. All the dishes were artistically crafted together to stimulate your visual senses too!\n\nMy boyfriend got the ribeye steak... a huge 12oz steak perfectly seasoned and grilled. He was extremely happy with his meal. We also ordered a half bottle of wine and the sommelier was very helpful. They also give you complimentary naan bread to eat with various sauces.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fancy place to dine at with reasonable prices! They have a 4 Diamond AAA rating for a reason!!!"

            "review": "Another superb dinner at Sensi. This fine restaurant is always our first choice when we visit Vegas (once every couple of months).  We always request Lawrence's section.  He is a bundle of great British eccentric energy and his enthusiasm for the restaurant is off the charts.  He's the best in Vegas. \n\nThe menu has something for everyone. Ask for the grilled Santa Barbara prawns if they have them (they often run out). The prawns are swimming in a large tank just before they are grilled...perfection.  The open kitchen is a fabulous design and I always give the steak chef a thumbs-up when he cooks my ribeye to medium-rare nirvana. \n\nOrder the three scoops of ice cream and wait until you see how it's presented...an extraordinary ice globe...beyond belief."

            "review": "Wow.  Sensi is a great concept - separate kitchens for different types of food.  American grill, seafood, Italian and Asian.  The restaurant, located in the Bellagio, has a clean style that really works - at first I thought all the glass could be antiseptic looking but no, not at all.  The water on the walls is an especially nice touch.  We were seated and quickly met our awesome waiter, Lawrence.  Lawrence knew the menu inside, out and backwards and made a few suggestions.  \n\nWe started with samosas for the table that were perfectly prepared with an excellent tamarind sauce.  I probably could have stopped there because we were also given papadums and naan with a sublime tomato chutney and yogurt cucumbar raita.  Three in our group ordered the coconut shrimp soup and haven't shut up about it yet.  Served in an almost entirely scraped coconut you can scrape a little for extra flavor.  The presentation was beautiful and they still haven't shut up about how great the soup tasted.\n\nFor dinner our party of six (our exchange student has a friend living in Vegas and she was able to meet up with us for dinner) was all over the menu.  K and N went with the butternut squash lasagna which was beautifully presented and delicious.  The other teenager in our group went with the chicken off of the Italian menu and loved it.  We had one seafood dish.  My friend and I both got the tandoori butter chicken curry.  Wow.  As a lover of Indian food I wasn't sure what to expect.  Mind blowing is what you should expect.  It was incredible - soft and perfectly seasoned and over a perfectly cooked rice.\n\nNo room for dessert, as usual.  Definitely put Sensi on your list of places to eat while in Vegas."

Big problem though was the photographer that walked through and strongly encouraged us to pose for photos, then tried to sell them to us for $70.  Huge mistake-- felt very Disney.  Just let me enjoy my dinner.\n\n- Bread (3/5)\nNaan, though not particularly good naan.  The spicy tomato sauce that comes with it is quite nice.  \n\n- Tongue & Cheek (5/5), $14\nWagyu tongue and wagyu cheeks... extremely tender and great flavor.  The little quenelles of mashed potato help cut through some of the richness in the beef.\n\n- Pork Chop (4/5), $36\nJuicy, succulent pork chops!  It's hard to keep them so juicy so I was quite impressed.  But the other components on the dish were extremely ordinary.  \n\n- Value (3/5) \nA bit on the expensive side, but good food overall."

We were 15 min or so early and he looked a little annoyed. Told us he could accommodate us then seemingly forgot about us while we looked at bellagio pool. When I reminded him about us, he looked annoyed then embarrassed. We were seated exactly at our reservation time. They brought water right away but didn't bring naan and dips till we ordered. Waiter was nice but hovered a bit. Ordered sparkling napa wine which is always good. Brussel sprouts were yummy. Tongue and cheek was good with tongue being tad chewier than necessary. Sea bass and chicken were perfect, but be prepared to make no substitutions to dish garnishments and dinner is going to take a few hours so you better really like your dinner companions lol"

            "review": "This was not our first experience at Sensi. We were fans from almost the day it opened at Bellagio several years ago. We had some extraordinary meals there. Maybe it was an off night, but our latest experience wasn't anything close to the Sensi we remembered from not even a year ago.  \n\nAmbiance and decor is still outstanding . . . and one of the few places in the area that is not overwrought with 20-something women in stilettos and men in their saggy jeans. \n\nThere were ample items on the menu that sounded delicious, but in reality did not live up to our expectations. Unlike one of the previous posters, we found the Sensi Roll Call sampler almost too ambitious with a combination of flavors that left a sour aftertaste.  We also had the Sensi Original Noodle. While the combination of the various items reminded us of something along the line of a pad thai or chow fun type dish, it was actually heavily laden with cumin. Oh, how I wish the item description would have said so . . . cumin, while a great antioxidant, is one of my least favorite herbs . . . so disappointed.\n\nThe house-made naan bread was stellar . . . I could have eaten at least two bread baskets all by myself! The best part of the entire meal . . . \n\nUnfortunately, the less than stellar food along with the surly manner of our waiter made for a very lackluster culinary experience."

I felt so relaxed, kind of reminded me of a really nice spa. So 5 star for the decor and ambience.\n\nFOOD: You get naan and this flat crispy bread (forgot what it was called) with side sauces of cucumers and/or chutney... the sauce was so flavorful. I liked both sauces, especially the chutney. Embarrassingly, my friend and I liked it so much that we had them pack the sauce and bread for us... no shame, haha.  I ordered TLC Roll and the Scuna Bay Salmon. The TLC roll was very good. It was crispy on the outside and there was avocado puree and chili aioli on the side. The avocado puree was amazing, I was drenching my roll with the puree. So delicious! Also, the scuna bay salmon was cooked to perfection. It was lightly crispy on the outside, but extremely soft, smooth, and moist on the inside. The texture was perfect. After dinner, we did not order any desserts, however; our server (who is amazing) gave my friend and I 2 pieces of truffles each. I didn't really see anyone else get the chocolate? Maybe we were girls or maybe the server pulled some strings for us? Not sure... but the truffles were amazing, so smooth and it just melts in your mouth. \n\nSERVICE: Very attentive and very sweet servers! I loved their company."

It was like Japanese, Korean, Italian and American all mashed into one, and they did not excel in a single category. I almost felt like I was at a buffet. Cocktail list has some amazing fresh cocktails and martinins. Menu was very strange to me. We ordered off their \"to share\" or small plate listing, a few nice things but for the most part it was blah. i was most disapointed with my ahi tuna which I ordered medium rare but came out one half being raw and the other half well done...I guess if I average the two I get medium rare???? Service was great, i will give them that."

The type of food served here is somewhat Asian fusion with a variety of Indian influences - they serve naan as their bread, not much more to say.\n\nWe had the Tempura King Crab Roll (was amazing) for appetizer, Miso Glazed California Halibut (pretty darn good) and Tandoori Surf & Turf Mixed Grill (good) for entree and was absolutely stuffed in a great way. \n\nThe prices weren't that bad either considering it was in the Bellagio and this is Vegas. Overall a 4.5 star experience and would highly recommend to anyone - i'm going back next time i'm in vegas!\n\nOne last thing...make reservations or you'll wait for at least 1 hour!"

Normally, this really wouldn't really bother me, but holy cow, the bus person kept slamming things down and cursing, which, needlessly to say, was incredibly unprofessional and made us uncomfortable. Our server wasn't that attentive and we had to hunt him down for the check. \n\nAnother annoying thing was there was another area in the restaurant that was really loud and echoed over to our side of the restaurant and that was distracting. Kind of an odd place.\n\nFood was delicious, though! Highly recommend the tofu scallops and fried shrimp appetizer."

I don't know why.  But on previous stays, the water feature had been enticing, so we pulled up a couple of bar stools and started a tab.\n\nIt seems to me that by the end of the evening, we had ordered just about everything on the menu.  I know that we ordered from every section of the menu, and sampled a version of every pretty drink that the other bargoers had in front of them.  (The bar staff was incredibly personable in a dry, bartendery way.  They knew a lot about a good drink, and had a handle on all the food, too.)\n\nThe upshot is this.  I'll try just about anything once.  My husband's Asian cuisine preferences extends about as far as General Tso's chicken, and the word \"fusion\" is like kryptonite.  And HE loved every single thing that we ordered.  I'm pretty adventurous in ordering but picky when eating, and I loved every single thing that we ate.\n\nIt's about as expensive as any other nice restaurant in a hotel on the strip.  And you'll probably have a better time if you don't show up in your cargo shorts.  But, when we go back, I bet we'll sit at the bar again."

There are few restaurants with the total creative concept that flows from the design and layout through the complete dining experience, matching the modern approach to culinary art and classic delicious dishes.\n\nWe had dinner at Sensi last night, after walking out of Prime Steakhouse \n\nWe have been coming to Sensi for several years. Always have had a great meal here.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden in the back part of Bellagio behind and to the left of the world famous Bellagio Arboretum. \n\nBuilt around solid granite blocks and open glass, Sensi has an open kitchen central to the dining room where fusion cuisine is prepared to order in view of the guests.\n\nItems range from steak, to chops, seafood, specialty salads and starters, as wall as several oriental inspired dishes. The restaurant provides delicious Naan Bread and an amazing tomato chutney and yogurt for dipping and enjoyment before your meal.\n\nThe bar list is amazing with several delicious concoctions, especially good is the Mojito that's made with legit ingredients.\n\nThe wine list is unbelievably solid. First Growth Bordeaux, Burgandy, Italian, Spanish, and New World that would rival some of the best steak houses in the nation.\n\nThat said, the service really makes the experience. Our server Michael from Long Island has been with the restaurant since the Bellagio opened. A statement of longevity that speaks to not only the economic viability of the restaurant but also the quality of the experience from the standpoint of the staff.\n\nWhen you have a place that exemplify class, you tend to keep great people who genuinely do what they do because they believe in it.\n\nSensi has a legit sommelier and wine stewards. \n\nThe place is amazing, I can't say enough good things about it. Price is reasonable, it's upscale but modern with a ton of class.\n\nTop to bottom, if dining is about a total experience for you and not just following the crowds to overhyped food conveyance, you need to add this to your list.\n\nSensi is Sensational!"

The first night was with a large group of people and the menu was Prix Fixe. Most the time you'll think that they're doing this just to get people fed and out-a-here. Not the case at all. Each course was a delight culminating with my main course - the salmon.\n\nThe next night was with 1/3 the amount of people and the menu was standard fare. Wider choice. In each case, you'll start with a fantastic mix of naan with tasty sauces. Then the crispy shrimp - awesome! The handmade meatballs are fantastic (and I wasn't a big meatball fan but at this place I am). The crab-lobster maki rolls? Delicious.\n\nThe first night I had the pacific salmon with miso glaze, mizuna, soy butter, shiitake mushroom. Simple and delightful. The second night, Jesse the waiter recommended the ribeye. Never had one so good and I've eaten at steak places in both Chicago and New York.\n\nLastly, the service. Top notch, world class. I was taken care of by Jesse the waiter both nights. He and his support staff handled their duties with perfection rounding out the entire positive experience.\n\nOh and the ambiance and atmosphere? Hip but not over the top. The kitchen is behind glass and you can watch what's going on but really it sets an atmosphere of energy and movement. The only, if ever so slightly small nitpick is that it's loud. But really, it's the energy that makes it loud as people are simply enjoying themselves. I certainly did."

Being a foodie I was looking forward to treating myself to some great food. Unfortunately, the food did not really deliver what I was looking for. The best part of the meal was the naan bread and dessert. I ordered the TLC Lobster Roll and Skuna Salmon as per the waiter's recommendation. \n\nThe TLC Roll had some great flavours going on but the rice was very undercooked to the point that is what hard to chew and very chalky. The filling was great but it was ultimately brought down by the rice. \n\nThe salmon was cooked to perfection and had a beautiful crisp on the top. The first few bites were delicious but the very simple flavour profile got repetitive halfway through and the sweetness I originally loved about the dish started to make me feel a bit nauseous. I wanted a \"wow\" dish and this was just a simple salmon that I can cook myself at home. So although pretty good it was a letdown.\n\nFor dessert I had the Chocolate Delight which was great. Not the best dessert I've ever had but the level of complexity in this dessert was what I was hoping I'd have in all 3 courses. It had a great variety of textures and flavours that all balanced each other perfectly. \n\nI also had a cocktail called The Matador that was pretty good. \n\nIf I had based this review on food alone I would have given this place 3 stars because my whole meal was good but nothing special. Maybe it's because I come from a city renowned for it's restaurants and am used to a higher standard but this was all pretty standard stuff. The big highlight of this place and the reason I gave it 4 stars was the exceptional service. I was checked on very often and the waiters and busboys were extremely cordial. The little truffle box that everyone gets with their bill is also a nice touch that put a smile on all their faces. A big thank you once again to the entire staff at Sensi who make every diner feel like a guest of honour."

It was served with a variety of sauces and it was warm and fresh out of the oven!\n\nFor an appetizer, we had the salt and pepper calamari. I really loved it!! It was my favorite part of the meal and I highly recommend it!\n\nFor my main course, I just had the tempura crab and lobster roll since I wasn't very hungry. It was only 4 pieces and it was ok. I kind of wish it was served with soy sauce and wasabi. \n\nI also tried the flat iron steak which was really good. It was just a bit too salty for me and I love salty food!  And I picked at some mashed potatoes as well but there was nothing really special about it.\n\nOne really great thing about this place was the treat they gave my good friend for his birthday. It was 3 scoops of ice cream in a little bowl made of ice with a birthday candle. It was complimentary and it was very nice! and tasty too!\n\nI'm big on ambiance so I consider it in my ratings and I thought that this place was nice. It was modern and clean cut but not too stuffy. The main focal point was the kitchen, which was in the middle of the restaurant behind glass. It was really cool. \n\nAnd the last good thing about this place was the wine. I got a half bottle of riesling which was roughly about 4 glasses and it ended up being the same price as two individual glasses."

I like that the menu has a bit of this and bit of that, it makes it a great place to take a group when not everyone is in the mood for the same type of food.  The ambiance is also one of my favorite aspects of the restaurant since I love being able to watch the food be made.  I have been here multiple times and they always deliver fresh delicious food.  This past visit I had the roll call appetizer that was both beautifully presented and tasted like heaven.  The pork pot stickers were superb as well.  My husband played it safe and stuck with the curry chicken, since we have had it in the past and both been very impressed. Sure enough, it was spectacular again.  We have always experienced top notch service and willingness to answer questions as well as a level of knowledge about the menu and food being prepared that makes for an even more memorable experience.  \n\nAnother thing worth noting is they make they make their own in house ginger beer.  It goes so well in many drinks, I highly suggest you get something with this added.\n\nI think Sensi sometimes gets overlooked simply because it's sort of off the beaten path, but it is well worth the visit and easy on the wallet, well, easy in comparison to many of the other nearby restaurants."

I couldn't have her yacking on the spa table, now could I?\n\nSensi is a very relaxing place with a variety of cuisine.  Indian, Asian, and plain ole American food were all represented.  She was able to find something hangover friendly along with their home-made ginger ale.  I had something light, too, as I didn't want to feel heavy and gassy on the massage table.  I think they frown on that, in general.\n\nTheir signature drink is delightful!"

I really liked the decor--very contemporary, but also organic feeling with the smooth/rough marble walls. We were sat at a booth that was sort of in a cubby in which the waitstaff could walk around the entire table.\n\nTheir homemade ginger ale is AMAZING! Get it.

The fried rice was so good that we ended up ordering another half way into our meal! My steak was perfectly cooked, and my friend's fish was so juicy and soft. \n\nThe dessert... let me tell you about the dessert. I ordered the gelato and sorbert that came in an ice teardrop (refer to pic). You have your pick from a variety of gelato and sorberts. We got coconut (my favorite), white chocolate espresso, and mango passion fruit. Everything was orgasmic. My friend ordered the blueberry cheesecake, and it was fantastic Not too sweet with a slight tarty kick to it.\n\nAs for service, 5/5.

Me and Mara G. walk in. Chef Martin Hierling, Executive Chef, just happens to be standing at the hostess stand with the hostesses. Mara G. remembered him from the Grand Opening -- SIX YEARS AGO. They strike up a brief conversation involving a lot of thoughtful agreement, whispering, nodding, and gesturing with foreheads towards me. We are seated with a full-view of half the open kitchen. Dining ensues.\n\nFlavio, our primary server, is super nice. Super nice. We order. Me: Pacific Pear cocktail. TLC roll. Scallops. The cocktail was at once gingery, sweet with Poire William, and a tad bit tart from the sour (house made, I'm sure) and necessary to temper the Vodka. Super yum delicious. I could have easily downed 3 or 4 of those babies. Remember, my blood alcohol is dangerously low. But I didn't. I had food to eat.\n\nWe finally figured out what the guy inside the glass enclosed kitchen center was doing. He was lifting naan out of the oven. A basket of it was delivered to our table. Lighter, fluffier naan, crispier flat breads, chunky chutney, cool creamy raita, and tangier tamarind sauce have never been produced on the planet. Why oh why, bread basket, do you exist? Don't you see my waistband straining as it is? You do realize I must eat you, don't you? \n\nMy TLC roll came out. If I say \"omg\" again, it will definitely lose its punch. But this tempura fried roll topped with lobster and crab (get it -- TLC) is definitely worth wearing out an overworked catch phrase of the 2K11. Oh My God! This creation was so good. The splashes of sriracha mayo and creamy wasabi were the perfect accents. I hate to say it, but I love saying it: I cleaned my plate! I probably shouldn't have, with multiple courses coming, but I couldn't help it. So good!\n\nFor the next course, I was expecting my scallops. All of a sudden, here comes Flavio with soup spoons. A treat from the chef! Wow! Thai coconut shrimp soup! In a hollowed out coconut bowl displayed on inedible salt on some kind of seashell. Wow! Can I just say this soup is more delicious by leaps and bounds than any Thai coconut soup I have heretofore experienced? Sweet, yet hot from the chili oil. Chock full of shrimp and enoki mushrooms. A little cilantro to top things off. This soup was the dancing water fountain light show in my mouth. (It is quite a stretch, but I am going to have to list this soup in my \"Crab Soup\" list for now until I rename it to seafood soups.) Thank you Chef!\n\nThen the scallops... These diver scallops could have doubled as hubcaps on my great grandfather's 57 Chevy. So huge! Yet so tender and flavorful; and no muscle. Gently seared scallops with sweet soy, sugar snaps, spinach, shallots, and enoki mushrooms, daikon radish, and perfectly steamed white rice (just for yucks)! :)\n\nBy now, I am stuffed to the gills. Mara G.'d ordered the tasting menu and had a dessert coming. But I was actually hoping to have time to sit back and savor the last few sips of my OR Riesling. Not.\n\nHere comes Flavio again with an ice sculpture shaped like a balloon with three ice cream scoops inside. A lit candle is in one of the scoops -- INSIDE the ice sculpture. Wow! What a feat of engineering. I blew it out and dove into salted caramel, espresso, and Madagascar vanilla ice cream scoops! (Misty, I was thanking MY lucky stars that all of the servers in house didn't come by beating a huge marching band bass drum and blowing \"new year's eve\" horns singing happy birthday like they did at Farrell's Ice Cream when I was 9 or 10.)\n\nThis ice cream was creating a similar experience for my taste buds, though. I have been in love with salted caramel since my visit to Sorella in NYC (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sorella-new-york#hrid:ovqOWowSYIQh4dxm_btJeQ) and I haven't been able to make it to Georgetown Cupcake in DC on Saturdays to get one of their salted caramel happy pills. But this scoop of salted caramel ice cream (along with the other flavors) hit the SPOT! Smooth, sweet, creamy, visually appealing, sexy even. Thank you Chef Martin! Thank you. Wow!\n\nBy 2/21, when the fullness subsided a bit, I was thinking of the pacific pear and the scallops. I will definitely return. Again and again. I loved this birthday dining taste sensation experience. Wow!"

I'm a sucker for anything water-related, so one glance at the sleek, black water walls surrounding this place (the bar is a beauty too) and I immediately begged my boyfriend to bring us back for dinner. Luckily, we were catching Cirque du Soleil's \"O\" in the same place later that night, so we decided to add in a dinner date before the show.\n\n* Ambiance: With black water walls surrounding the exterior, boulder-like walls in the hosting area, and dimmed lighting, it almost feels like you're entering a cave. The inside of the restaurant is very sleek with just a delicate brush of modern Asian flair. I like that the sushi/seafood kitchen and wine cellar is enclosed in a glass room in the middle of the restaurant so you can watch the chefs at work.\n\n* Food: Since we were in a time crunch, we ordered wine and cold sake and went straight for entrees. I was sad I couldn't try any of the appetizer specialty rolls (they sounded divine!), but at least the complimentary hot-and-fresh-out-of-the-oven naan bread and sauces (I liked the Vietnamese sweet chili one the best) were delicious starters. I ordered the Miso Glazed Wild Salmon to pair with my glass of Sauvignon Blanc while my boyfriend opted for the Kalbi Flat Iron Steak. Both were *excellent* choices! When my plate arrived - fat, fluffy salmon cuts shimmering in the dim light due to the generous amount of miso glaze slathered on - I couldn't wait to dive in. My boyfriend's Kalbi steak was also delicious and perfect. If we had time to sample appetizers and desserts, I'd feel more confident in giving a Sensi a 5. I was at war with myself on whether we had time to get dessert (luckily, my beau is more practical than I am), but at least they sent us off with a small box of yummy chocolate truffles to munch on during \"O\"!\n\n* Service: All the staff members here were extremely pleasant. Top-notch service for a top-notch place! There was also a Bellagio photographer walking around offering to take pictures, and they turned out so nice that we figured \"what the hell\" and succumbed to buying two large photos for $45. There's my \"we're in Vegas, baby!\" attitude talking.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant if you're staying in The Bellagio. If not, it's worth a walk in the dry Vegas heat. ;)"

I would give it 5 based on what I had, but the husband didn't like his lamb and said he most likely would not return. \n\nBEST THING I EVER ATE - BEST THING I EVER ATE - NAAN BREAD AT THIS PLACE !!\n\nWOW. Amazing. There is a guy in the kitchen making the naan all night, I watched him do it. Hand rolled, cooked on the grill. The freshest FRESHY FRESH you could ever imagine. Yes.\n\nMuscles and clams with chorizo for an appetizer. Excellent. \n\nI had the Sensi noodles - like asian noodles, they come with shrimp and tofu. Excellent and most places seem to get shrimp rubbery, this was amazing. Perfect and tender, and a HUGE portion. Like almost Claim Jumper sized ( if you know what I mean ).  My husband got the lamb, he did not care for it, his portion size was more average.\n\nService here is good. This is more casual than other restaurants at Bellagio, seems more so than Olives or Yellowtail etc...  but not SO casual. They give you a little 'gift box' at the end of your meal with some really great chocolate truffles in it as well, very nice.\n\nThe prices are a little high and I recommend looking at the menu on line before going. There is a nice variety, but maybe not everyone. I liked it a lot."

The plan was to drive to the Mirage, grab a parking spot and go see a show there, and then drive to the Bellagio for dinner.  We had reservations at 9:30 PM.   No problemo, right?\n\nWell, driving in Las Vegas is hella stressful, and even more stressful for my stepfather, who drives rather seldom....   Basically this whole drive (or ride, in my case)  was somewhat akin to playing Russian roulette with a dirty ol' Russian gun that misfires one out of every three shots.   Best bet, you may not permanently blow your head off but you'll blow a hole through your head large enough that you'lll retain more than a slight speech impediment....   Yeah, just lovely....\n\nAnyway, so we eventually made it to Sensi at 9:40, some 10 minutes after our reservations.   They couldn't seat us then & there, but they said it'd be about 20-30 minutes..... Fine, I thought, I'll order a stiff martini to calm the nerves after this brutal drive we just had... and we'll eventually be seated.  The bartender was slow and full of attitude, preferring to stare at the cute playboy bunnies who were looking at him lovingly instead of making my fucking martini.   Can't say I blame him, other than the fact that I wanted some liquid medicine... AND FAST!!!\n\nWe were eventually seated some 30 minutes later... We ordered 3 oyster shooters for appetizer and, as main course:  1 Roasted Salmon, 1 New York Steak, 1 Day Boat Scallop, and 1 Lamb Chop...   We ordered 2 side dishes alongside that:  mashed potatoes and deep fried asparagus.\n\nAs far as drinking was concerned, I wanted to order a nice bottle without freaking everybody out, so I ordered wine # 14437, which, as it turns out, was the Brunello Altesino and it was ripe to perfection... An absolutely perfect wine pairing.\n\nFood was way good, portions were generous, and the wine definitely complemented the food very well.   I ate the lamb chop and really enjoyed it.  The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone.   I tasted my wife's scallops and man-oh-man were they awesome too!  Served with a puree of English peas, it was a delightful dish.   My stepfather seemed to enjoy his steak, and my mother definitely enjoyed her salmon.\n\nService was wonderful... Shortly after we started our dinner, the sommelier came to let us know we had ordered the last bottle of 14437 but made several other recommendations.   Frankly, we had no intent to dig into another bottle, seeing as the first one was already $121, but still, it was very professional of him to come and let us know.  Our waitress was fabulous...\n\nDecor, very modern and trendy and, thankfully, not too loud.  All in all a wonderful dining experience and Sensi goes into my top 20 in America fo' sho'"

The service is always amazing - from the minute you walk thru the doors.  And the food is unbelievable and priced really well.  I recommend getting the Naan bread - there is an oven and cook devoted to this.  Yum!  And my favorite dishes are the Short Rib or Sea Bass.  There is a new beet salad on the menu that I just had this weekend that inspired me to write this review.  It has Mascarpone and Feta and is to die for.

You see, we had the Chef's table, next to the kitchen, in this somewhat secluded space for our dinner which we weren't rushing through.  Midway through our meal, P.Ewing himself comes strolling through the restaurant with his entourage, sees that our table is occupied, loses his smile and sulks over to another table that clearly is not as roomy for the big guy.  Sorry Pat.  But when you're celebrating the father-in-law's Bday and one of the guests is the Attorney General of NV, hoops players get the shaft.\n\nThe place was on the dark side with lots of earthy materials, rocks, stone sides, etc.  Even the plates and silverware had caveman-esqe flair to them.  The food was good with my wife and I sharing her scallop dish and my rib-eye.  Come to think of it, I think half of our table got the rib-eye so it was pretty popular.  This place has a strange menu with a few things from different types of cuisines.  Some American, some Asian, and I think some Indian too.  Like I said, I don't remember the meal as well as I remember Ewing's face."

No.  The commonality is the use of farm fresh, sustainable ingredients and extremely well executed,  delicious food.\n\nAlthough the menu is categorized by cuisine, it is possible, and even fun to order different styles.  Flavors are unique but the menu is so well conceived that they do not clash.  The food is whimsically presented and is contemporary (you will see foam on at least one dish).\n\nThe \"TLC Roll\" with tempura lobster, crab, a whipped avocado and siracha aioli is incredible.  The sweetness of the lobster and crab accentuated by the heat of the siracha and balanced with the richness of the avocado.  The salt and pepper calamari, a Chinese play on the usual preparation, is served with a spicy curried tomato chutney and is just good eats.  Finally, don't pass on the duck pot stickers.  Little packets of delicious goodness.\n\nFor mains, the miso glazed halibut roasted and served in an incredibly fragrant ginger broth.  Outstanding.  A take on a Japanese classic.  Delicious.  The braised short rib is well prepared (not over braised so the fat is totally gone) but its flavor is common.\n\nI really wish Sensi would make entr\u00e9es from their add on's (Spot Prawns, Sonoma foie, and roasted bone marrow).

An open kitchen sits in the middle of the main dining room so you can watch the chefs at work. Watching them make the naan bread is entertaining AND makes my mouth water! \nSensi is super luxurious, clean and crafty. Asian fusion restaurants usually scare me, but I'm surprised by how comforting Sensi made me feel. I blame it on the ambiance! Their menu offers various flavors for even the most discerning palates. The lobster (think the one I had was a special of the day because it wasn't on the menu. This was in 2008 though) and any of the steaks =YUM! The portions aren't out of control big which gives you plenty of room to indulge in dessert. House made ginger ale is refreshing and a must for ginger ale fans. OH! The menu changes often.

I've had this establishment bookmarked for quite some time, and it appears there was a time during which this place was missing the mark. I am glad that it wasn't the case in this instance. \n\nWe had a reservation for 9:15pm, arrived a bit early and sat at the bar while waiting for our table. As far as Vegas fine dining goes, I was not overly impressed by the design or the decor of this place. I like simplistic, but this was overly so and it looked like the furniture needed some updating. We were seated at 9pm and had a great view of the open kitchen. It reminded me of a fish tank.\n\nWe opted for the chef's tasting menu ($85 per person) which is is very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. Our server was great... he was like Beetlejuice -- appeared when we needed him, left us alone otherwise. We started off with a bread basket and two dipping sauces, one being of spicier variety to go with the naan bread that was served. It was a bit confusing to me and I wasn't sure how naan was tied into the whole theme of the menu, but I digress.\n\nMy husband and I each ordered different things off the chef's tasting menu so that we can sample everything on it. In addition, we ordered half a dozen oysters and also Octopus Crostini which for me was by far the most underwhelming part of the meal. I thoroughly enjoyed the cauliflower soup, the scallop was cooked to PERFECTION and to me scallops are the ultimate test of one's culinary prowess, Tongue & Cheek was packed with flavor and the Hanger Steak was juicy and cooked to perfection.\n\nMy only complaint is that toward the end of the evening, the meal spacing became way too long and I was starting to feel too full to enjoy my dessert (Greek Yogurt panna cotta). I think we were getting antsy to get dinner over with and continue on with our night.\n\nThe bill was reasonable and the food as well as the service both hit the mark. I would highly recommend the chef's tasting menu."

It turned out to be some great food, although there were a few service issues. I will say that the ladies working the hostess station were great - extremely friendly.\n\nWe were seated at the bar at first since we didn't have a reservation, but the wait was really short - maybe 10 minutes tops at about 8:30-9:00 The bartender was a tad abrupt but the slightly older one who picked up the bill was gracious. I had the \"Jala Back\" since I like some spice, and it was good - I ended up ordering another with dinner.\n\nThe naan and dipping sauces that came first were fabulous - the best naan I've had. I appreciate that there was a spicy and a 'regular' sauce since I love spice and my friend cannot eat it. I would have had a whole meal of the naan. We shared two appetizers - the steamed buns and the crab+lobster maki roll. Both were fantastic. The steamed buns were soft and luscious with the correct pickle and sauce. The roll was also great and the portions were perfect. For entrees, I had the Yellowfin Tuna, which was cooked perfectly, and my friend had the special, which was served with dashi and vegetables and she loved. The entree portions were also perfect to be satisfactory but not too big. For dessert, we had the banana with peanut butter ice cream. The ice cream was great - I could have done without the banana. \n\nNow, the only issues were that 1) the pacing of the meal was off. The whole dinner took almost two hours. I noticed slow service seemed common in Vegas in general, though. 2) We never actually figured out who our waiter was. One guy came to take our drink order, disappeared to get water, and when a lady with water appeared several minutes later, she had no idea that we'd already been asked about it. Then another man popped up with an iPad asking about drinks. The first guy reappeared to take our order, then throughout the meal we had at least three people coming and going asking how we were doing (none of them management), someone dedicated to serving the dishes, and a different person taking our dessert order, and at one point a waiter called my friend - a lady - \"sir\", which he was very embarrassed about. They were all nice, but it appeared disorganized.\n\nOverall, this was a good meal, and although I may not make it a destination if I were staying at another hotel, I have no problem recommending it and would return if I were at The Bellagio."

Knowledgable, helpful, willing to call around to other restaurants if you need a reservation for lunch (they are only open for dinner) we chatted for a bit and ended up coming back for dinner the next night. Bravo! Deserve a raise!\n\nMove on to our waiter, Lawrence; funny, attentive, helpful and just well...again part of the overall charm of the restaurant. \n\nThey place naan down with two sauces, a cool cucumber and a spiced up tomato one I believe - there is an Indian chef making it there while you watch. Our first course was the Summer salad; grilled peaches+apricot, arugula, white balsamic, burrata cheese (ingredients change based on time of year) $15. The cheese melted on your tongue - perfect blend of ingredients nothing overpowering. \nNext came the Thai, coconut, lemongrass soup with morel mushrooms - normally I would NEVER eat a mushroom - I ate all of the (okay, my husband stole a few) - you can eat most of the bowl, the coconut is so tender you can peel it off with your spoon.\n\nMoved on to the gnocchi with vegetables for $17 - lightly browned in butter again, melted in your mouth. We ordered a side of tempura asparagus and this has a tomato dipping sauce! I had a ginger ale with lime that they make there so freshing and after too much red wine the night before - a nice break ($6.00).\n\nMost folks were casually dressed before the 8:00 hour summer dresses or nice jeans with nice tops and sweaters. A few families with children but mostly adults. The music in the background was Sting and such. Table made of natural wood and the background blended as well.\n\nOh and there is a woman who politely asked if you want your photo. We don't usually say yes to photos but thought okay why not and glad. She did a wonderful job. $20 for small (2 photos in silver fabric frames $45 for large).\n\nSo, go, enjoy, bring your friends, we cannot wait to go back!"

My husband had the steak, and he wasnt impressed with the Filet.  It seems here they just let the meat stand on its own, which is good for hardcore meat lovers, but he wanted some extra flavor.  The naan was awesome and the tomato chutney was as my husband says \"the bomb\"..\n\nThe cool part about sensi is that the bill comes on fancy paper and in a backlit bill holder...they also gave us free chocolates at the end."

We seriously considered eating there a second night. Our waiter was a British fella named Lawrence from Alabama (yeah that was interesting) but he was extremely entertaining. He is by far the best waiter we've had at any restaurant. \n\nThe food was so fresh and flavorful. We appreciated that they source local and sustainable foods and grow their own herbs and some veggies. We had the crispy fried shrimp and the crab-lobster maki roll for appetizers. Both were excellent with outstanding flavorful sauces. My wife had the curry scallops which were incredible and not a normal way to have scallops but might be the best when it comes to flavor fusion. The scallops were perfectly prepared. I had the fresh catch of the day which was line caught tuna, on spaghetti squash. It was super yummy and fresh. It was actually more than I could eat. No small plates here. There were baby purple potatoes on my plate too which tasted like they were dug that morning; I know because I grow my own food. For dessert we had two dessert wines. Two white wines with the dinner brought the tab to $200 not including tip. \n\nThe atmosphere was very sensual as the name suggests. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant with glass panes so you can see everything. Lawrence would explain to us what they were doing in the kitchen. We were placed with a perfect view of everything. \n\nThe night we went (a Tuesday night) was quiet and slow. It shouldn't have been as slow as it was; this might be the best kept secret in Vegas. We've eaten at many more expensive and higher rated restaurants in Vegas; Sensi has just moved to the top of our list. We are going there first for our next trip"

The balance of flavors, the service ( our waiter Laurence was so knowledgeable and entertaining), the venue- it's pretty tucked away in the back of Bellagio, but you feel worlds away from everything. Very open and airy, after being in the scorching hot Vegas sun and the smokey casinos. \n\nWe had:\n- Blackberry cocktails (with Hangar One vodka- can't go wrong here!!)\n- Naan bread: mix the two sauces it comes with, yum!\n- TLC roll: very flavorful, a little bit crispy. Delicious.\n- Avocado beignets : I've never had fired avocado before, but this was yummy, especially with the tomato sauce they serve it with. \n- Oxtail buns: these were very very heavy but so flavorful.\n- Filet Mignon, with sides of mushrooms, fried rice, and broccoli. The filet was good, though a tad dry ( and I order mine medium rare). Mushrooms were amazing. Fried rice also good. Broccoli was a bit bland, but I was so overwhelmed with the other amazing flavors that that was somehow bound to happen.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but they gave me a little parting gift of delicious truffles.

Yep, that pretty much sums up my experience at Sensi.\n\nUpon entering Sensi we seated next to a large party of eight and another table that included an infant.  Dozens of empty tables but they plopped us down in that spot.\n\nTangent: Now, I don't hate small children, I really don't, but I hate being near them in upscale restaurants.  I go to upscale restaurants so I don't have to be near them and hear them scream.  Yes, kids are adorable and are the future, blah, blah, blah, but I am not paying $50 pp to listen to a stranger's child cry.  \n\nOkay, so, yes, the child screamed/yelled/stared at me through the meal and the large party of eight, who apparently never learned the concept of \"inside voices,\" aurally overwhelmed the restaurant's other diners.  This is not entirely the restaurant's fault, however, but they could have handled the situation better.  The noise pretty much ruined the meal.\n\nThe food was pretty disappointing too.  My restaurant week menu included the steamed Chinese buns, the grass-fed skirt steak, and the chocolate temptation.\n\nThe Chinese steamed buns may have been the worst thing I've eaten in awhile.  The dried-shrimp filling, which was incredibly salty, combined with the unbearably sweet hoisin vinagarette sauce, was almost unpalatable.  DO NOT WANT.\n\nThe skirt steak was fine but it was a rather small portion.  It included expertly-made brussel sprouts and spaghetti squash.  I hate brussel sprouts but I loved these!  This dish saved the experience from being an epic disaster.\n\nThe chocolate temptation was basically a ferrero rocher candy bar topped with insanely burnt-tasting caramel ice cream.  It was okay, but also kind of gross (the ice cream overwhelmed the entire dish).\n\nWe had very little interaction with our waiter but he seemed nice enough.  Not particularly helpful or attentive, however.  I went on a Wednesday specifically so I would get better service (less busy = attentive service, right?), but that wasn't the case here.\n\nSad to say, it gets 1.5 stars.  The only bright spots were the skirt steak and awesome naan bread basket (free with meal).  Blargh."

We were then told it would be 10 or 15 minutes they were waiting on a table. 25 turned to 30, then 45, then over an hour past our reservation. Every time we went to the desk she advised the manager would take care of us. I felt the hostess should have been more proactive in letting us know what was going on and not for us to come back repeatedly asking. \n\nWhen the manager finally came around to us he advised because of the builders/Kbis conventions in town a group had pretty much decided to use their restaurant as a meeting place and had long since finished and were just sitting there and not leaving. \n\nHe did wipe out out bar tab and when we were seated three appetizers were quickly brought out to us. He also personally kept checking in on us. \n\nNow the good. The service once seated was stellar. The food even more so. I had the roasted chicken and I have to say it was one of the best cooked chicken I ever had. It was such a brilliant white color and moist through out.

We all ended up eating our whole plates it was that good. \n\nThen the manager sent out desert which was also brilliant. \n\nAll and all for three of us with plenty of bar drinks and a 3 course meal it ended up costing us 150. That should have been our bar bill alone. So yes they made up for the reservation issue and then some. And for the record when we left well after 10 that large party was still there, but ordered desert to split to justify the 15 place settings they were taking up going on 4 plus hours."

Reasons for two stars:\n\n1) Service (1 star) - While the waiter was hiding behind the wall, the food runner was filling our drinks and had to go after the waiter each time we needed something. \n\n2) Appetizer (1 star): Assorted rolls - Disgusting. No flavor, and overpriced. Tasted like something I would buy from Trader Joes.\n\n3) Pita Bread & Dipping Sauce (5 Stars) - The best part of the meal. The pita bread was fresh, and the dips were amazing. Why couldn't the main courses be similar?\n\n4) Tuna Consera (1 star) - Very tasteless. Didn't taste like anything. It didn't taste fresh, or cooked. Something in between. Tasted like sesame seeds.\n\n5) Ribs (1 star) - Took one bight, and left it alone. My cafeteria serves better food.\n\n6) Chocolates (5 Stars) - The second best part of the dinner.\n\nNever going to eat at this place again. Definitely overrated!"

After five years of going to many of the other fine restaurants in Las Vegas, We keep coming back to Sensi. The food is creative and exciting-- even artistic. Flavors that just say \"WOW!\". The service is always excellent. My only disappointment is that, due to the economy, it is no longer open for lunch. I have never, in 20 meals over five years, had a negative experience here. Don't miss this place. Last night's meal was outstanding. My wife had the portobello encrusted halibut while I had the braised short ribs. Desert was, of course \"the best tapioca pudding, ever\". And the naan! The free before-dinner naan! Mmmmm!"

After doing the tourist \"thing\" of taking pictures in the Bellagio hotel and walking around, my friend and I happened upon Sensi.  The vibe looked awesome and the menu looked yummy!  My friend says to me, \"its your birthday, lets have drinks and dinner here.\"  We excitedly walked to the bar anxious to order drinks, bottles and some good food.  As we approached the bar, there appeared to be only one bar stool available, so we kind of stood there and looked around for possibly another stool.  The bartender approached us and we asked him if he could possibly get another stool so that we could sit down.  He sarcastically looked around and said, \"Looks like there are no other seats available.\" and then gave us a silly smile.  He said it loud enough so that the bar (its kind of small) all looked at us.  Not cool Mr. Bartender.  Here is my note to the manager at Sensi:\n*  Inform your staff that customer service is key.  I get that there was not another chair, but there is another way to approach this and make potential customers feel good.\n* You never know WHO you are potentially servicing.  I work in radio and if I lived in Vegas, I would put your spot on BLAST.\n*  We ended up going to Beso at Aria and had a GREAT experience.\n*  take a day to TRAIN staff to be attentive and friendly (not sarcastic)"

            "review": "When researching restaurants in Vegas, Sensi kept coming up as a highly recommended place - by critics and patrons.  When we called to make a reservation and ask if they would be open to making something vegan (I always ask ahead...  sometimes chefs love accommodating requests like that, other times it aggravates the heck out of them) I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they have a vegan risotto on their menu!  Score!  We were there...\n\nWhen we got there, the person I had made the reservation with had communicated to our server that I was vegan.  He acknowledged it right off the bat and directed the non-vegan specials to my husband.  Then he told me about the vegan risotto AND how they could swap out the scallops with tofu in the Thai scallops entree.  He then walked me through suggestions on how they could veganize other dishes -- plus, he noted which breads and sauces on the table were vegan.  Talk about going WAY above and beyond.  That's better service than I get in most vegan restaurants.  \n\nI later asked him if he was vegan (he was not).  Some of his knowledge was general and from experience with precious customers and much of it was on the spot from talking with the kitchen and other staff, which was pretty darn cool if you ask me.  I love, love, love when I can go in to a restaurant and really experience it like that.  Eating vegan in non-vegan restaurants usually means settling for the one vegetarian dish that is already on the menu and asking them to \"hold the cheese\".  Not here -- this server, whose name I regret I didn't get so can't mention in this post - went above and beyond to help create a path for me so my experience was as luxurious and enjoyable as those looking at the full menu.\n\nIn the end, I had the farmer's salad (delish) and the Thai scallops, swapped out with tofu and it was out of this world.  Those, combined with the wine (they had a very nice wine selection) and great view in to their glass-enclosed fishbowl style kitchen, made for a really, really enjoyable evening.\n\nWe would have gotten dessert there if my husband didn't have his heart and eyes on a sweet crepe from the Jean Philippe Patisserie.  :)\n\nI highly recommend Sensi to anyone looking for an incredible meal and experience out in Vegas.  The restaurant is physically removed from the casino area so you really feel like you are getting away from the Vegas chaos for a bit.  This place isn't like many of the pretentious celebrity-chef restaurants either.  It's just hands down incredible food, service, and environment.  When we're back in Vegas, we'll definitely go back."

The menu is really interesting and as a group of 3 we tasted many items:\n- Tongue & Cheek (wagyu tongue & veal cheek)\n- Cavatelli with Pork\n- Scallops (main, but shared)\n- Brussels Sprouts\n- Crab & Lobster Roll\n- Poutine\n- Pork Buns\n\nEverything was good, some items were great. The tongue & cheek was fantastic. Relatively small portion (two pieces of each) but both are so tasty. A nice rich reduction tops it off. Everyone at the table loved the cavatelli. The pasta was just right and the flavour was nice. Pork buns had a nice texture in the dough -- like your traditional Chinese pork buns, but as a taco. The filling was good. Crab and lobster roll is very tasty. Scallops were perfectly cooked, but like most scallops not a flavour extravaganza. Poutine good, but as a former Quebecer, I prefer it home style (with real curds). My U.S. colleagues had never had poutine and really liked it. Sprouts were just good roasted sprouts.\n\nThe wine list, sommelier and waiter were also winners. I would definitely recommend and return."

And as someone else mentioned, it's an odd location within the Bellagio for such a sleek and sassy restaurant, so it took us a while to even find it. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm just so darn patient, but despite its shortcomings I really liked this place anyway.  The menu is one of the more unique I've seen, with creative Asian dishes living alongside Tandoori grill items and traditional fish.  Resisting eating my weight in bread topped with some sort of herby creamed cheese, we started with the lobster/ crab rolls, which came out on a fancy block of ice.  I had the scallop/ halibut as my main dish, and while I'm not quite sure what everything on my plate was (pea puree?  raviolis filled with something tasty?  cauliflower??), it was absolutely delicious.  My mama had the Tandoori mixed grill, which came with possibly the most amazing naan bread I've ever had, overflowing with sauteed red onions and topped with chili flakes.  Papa had some sort of steak, an option which literally provided him with a giant chunk of red meat and nothing else.  As I don't eat meat, I wasn't impressed, but he seemed to dig it.  We also ordered the carmelized onion mashed potatoes (a little salty but delish) and the broccoli rabe (a little mushy for my taste), so luckily we were stuffed enough to not care that we didn't have time for dessert."

It's cool to try once, but I don't think I'll be back."

He lives in Vegas and says he goes to Sensi about three times a week and now I can see why.\n\nThe staff was very courteous and the food...magnifique. The best was probably the sashimi which was so fresh and flavors....omg, words can't describe. We also ordered the Chicken Tandoori. Coming from Chicago with Devon Avenue and it's Indian culture it was just hard to top the flavors but I appreciate the attempt.\n\nWe ended our meal with gelato. Salty caramel, pistachio and vanilla bean. Wow..the salty caramel was like a party in my mouth. It was sinful. \n\nI will definitely hit Sensi up again when I'm back in Vegas."

I can tell they were magnificent because the 1/2 dozen stayed on the table for less than 5 minutes.\n\nEver the small plate lover, this menu was perfect for me! I had the handmade meatballs and brussel sprouts which were both cooked perfectly.

As we sat down our waiter (forgot his name, but remembered he was from LA as his name tag said) came to greet us instantly.  The customer service here is impeccable, the waiters, the host, and the busboys are amazing.  We never really had to ask for anything, they just came.  First came the bread bowl, which was naan, sooo good.  The spice tomato chutney that they have is to die for, sweet and spicy.  I could eat that forever.  We ordered the roll call (one of each roll) which was good except it would have been nice if all four were not fried rolls.  We also had the grilled octopus (the BF loved this one with the saffron aioli) and the bone marrow (which was nice because you could actually eat this one, they didn't use the skimpy bone marrow).  We also had some oysters, so fresh!  And we finished it off with their fried rice.  This was by far my favorite, it was nice because it was surprisingly sweet but not too much that it didn't feel like something my grandma used to make.\n\nWe will be back in the future :)"

I love how there's water flowing over the sign, it's so zen!  I didn't really know much about the restaurant, other than it was some type of Asian fusion but always intended on trying it one day. The perfect opportunity came up when my BF's bday arrived.  Not really knowing how busy this place gets, I made reservations two weeks in advance for a Thursday night. I let the receptionist know that I am celebrating my BF's bday and that we're first time diners.\n\nFast forward to my baby's birthday..\nI'm driving to the strip and my BF has no idea where i'm taking him for his surprise bday dinner.  I pull into the Bellagio and we start walking towards Sensi.  He is ecstatic and happy as hell because he's been bugging me to go to this restaurant for the longest time.  I approach the hostess and checked in for our 8:00pm reservation.  We were seated promptly along a narrow walkway at a big round table set for four.  This table was placed in a very awkward area and I wasn't comfortable there.  Also, because it was just my BF and I who were having dinner I don't understand why the hostess would seat us at such a big table.  I immediately asked if we can be moved to a different one and she quickly blurted out that there were no other tables and walked away.  I called over a man in a suit and asked him if he could please move us to a more suitable table set for two away from the narrow walk way; he gladly obliged.\n\nOn to dinner.  We were greeted briefly by our waiter (forgot his name) and was asked what we would like to drink.  He left after and came back asking us if we were ready to order.  it was our first time here, mind you, and had no idea what this restaurant was about.  Luckily, I took it upon myself and briefly browsed some yelps and learned that they offered a prefix menu.  For some reason the waiter didn't feel the need to explain the concept of the restaurant or offer us the tasting menu.  I asked about it, he pointed it out, and then he walked away.  My BF and i decided to give the menu a try so that we could get a pretty good selection.  We let the waiter know our choices and asked if we could decide on dessert after dinner.  He took the menus and walked away.  That was the extent of the service we received from him.  This other guy, who was such a sweetheart, tended to us, checked up on us, filled our waters, changed our plates, gave us bread, etc.  When dinner was over our waiter didn't even offer us dessert.  I overheard him asking the same guy who's been taking care of us to present us with the menu.  At this point i was extremely agitated because I noticed our waiter taking care of his other tables with great care and attentiveness.  I can't imagine why he chose to neglect us; It wasn't  a super busy night and his section was manageable. \n\nAnyway, I passed on desert (even though it was a part of our meals) because this waiter ruined my night.  He brought out a complimentary birthday desert anyway for my BF.  I tipped him a little less than 15%, although i really felt he deserved a big fat 0!!! Then I side tipped the server assistant some cash, since he's the one who took care of us.\nI was on my way out when the same man who moved us earlier asked how our dinner went.  Boy did my BF and I give him our 2cents!  We work in industry so I cant imagine how a place with a 4 star review on yelp have such shitty service!!!!\n\nThe food: It was ok.  I had the chicken curry and i've had better.  My BF had the halibut.  It lacked flavor, needed more salt, and was overcooked.  We had King crab roll which were too big and had too  much tempura breading: not good!  The one thing I really did enjoy, however, was the naan that they give along with the different sauces!! YUM!.  \n\nOver all\n1.) service was a 0.  I seriously think he discriminated on us based on age, which is a shame because i'm a damn good tipper!!\n2.) hostess was a 0.  I don't see why you'd seat me at a big table, knowing it was a party for 2, and then tell me there's no where else to put us... considering I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance!!! Ridiculous!\n3.) Food was alright, i'd give it a 3, but i'm mostly basing this review on service.  So my star rating dropped to a 2.  I'd probably come back to try the other stuff because it seems like they have some interesting dishes.  Just really disappointed with the whole experience the hostess and server gave us.  The manager did apologize and gave us his business card urging us to come back.  He advised us to contact him prior so that he can make arrangements to make up for the horrible experience we had on what was supposed to be a really special dinner; I thought that was a plus."

After a so-so meal (they were out of oysters, shrimp, and crab and the kobe beef was ok and a little cold and everything was so infused with ginger especially the sea bass), I came to find that there was shattered glass on the side of my chair and on the floor. \n    How did I find the glass? A few pieces were jabbed in to my hand when I went to get up from my chair. After notifying management who did nothing more than clean up the glass, I was left to pick the pieces of glass out of my bleeding hand. Nothing more was said from our waiter or management. Not even an apology or offering of a Band-Aid. After leaving the restaurant about 30 minutes later and consulting with my dad (who owns a hotel and restaurant himself) I decided to call and speak with Veronica (manager) regarding my poor experience. She was extremely rude and defensive and said that in these situations the only thing they would have done would be to call security to get the glass out of my hand. Appalled that she was not taking this situation seriously, I spoke with her manager only to find that Veronica had lied about my experience stating that she had called security but that I had left before they came. It's an obvious admission of guilt of dealing with my situation when the manager has to lie to her manager regarding this experience. Sadly the most that Veronica's manager offered was to \"take care\" of one item which still has not been done by the way. \n       The thing is, this wasn't about $$, this was about cleanliness, safety and ultimately customer service. The poor customer service, ok food, and long wait time for everything was absolutely ridiculous, especially at such a \"nice\" restaurant."

It's delicious and is executed with impeccable panache. \n\nI shared the wild mushroom gnocchi, the veggie roll, the vegan carrot risotto and the tempura vegetables with a fellow vegetarian friend. It was more than enough food for the 2 of us, and everything we tried was delicious. I also loved the delightful little amuse-bouches the chef sent us, including an amazing mushroom cappuccino. \n\nThe BEST part though, was the absolutely stunning (and huge) dessert tower. It consisted of french macaroons, tarts, salted caramels, chocolates, cakes, ice cream cones with gelato and petit fours. Despite the tremendous amount of dessert contained in this \"tower,\" my friends and I finished everything within 10 minutes. \n\nLOVED this place. It was definitely one of the highlights of my last Vegas trip."

And when we do, we do it in a big way, Vegas-style, of course.  And on one night, we had to take one of our clients for dinner.\n\nEnter Sensi...this after we've called a few dozen restaurants for a reservation with no luck. \n\nSo yes, Sensi was our last resort and I'm absolutely glad dinner was on company expense because if I was going to pay for it on my own, you won't see me here. \n\nNo value whatsover for your money.\n\nLet me explain, lest my review is removed again for lack of \"first-hand experience\" (yeah, whatever).\n\nLet's start with the menu. Well, it's limited and  a mish-mash of Asian and Italian-inspired dishes, with a couple of meats and fishes thrown in as a after-thought. And, oh, they don't have any special.\n\nThe service was lacking or rather we didn't see the server unless we call him. And I won't normally do that in a restaurant. Besides, it's his job to regularly check on his table. Not the other way around where I have to see who's missing something on our party and tell  it to the server. \n\nAnd when we're served with what we have ordered, well, I'm speechless. Speechless because I can't really say something about it. And take it as a bad thing. It just lacked some umph. I was really hoping that dessert would somehow save Sensi, but no.\n\nLike a song, Sensi is one-note, monotonous. Didn't fire up my senses whatsover. Makes sense?"

Everything from the food, service, and ambiance was just simply awesome!\n\nSensi is a little hard to spot inside Bellagio.  You don't really notice any signage for it on the casino floor and I even asked one waitress where it was and she had no idea!  Just keep walking past the Conservatory of Flowers and Jean Phillippe Patisserie and you'll find it!\n\nThe layout of the restaurant is pretty cool in that all of the kitchen stations are visible in the middle of the dining room showing all diners all the action behind the kitchen.\nhttp://bit.ly/11E6B4C\n\nI've done some research before my trip and already knew what I was getting, which were the Roll Call, which is a sampler of all their Sensi Rolls, and their Famous Wok Lobster\n\nRoll Call - Sensi Roll Sampler -- http://bit.ly/ZgsTuz\nTataki Roll - seared spicy tuna roll, tuna tartare, miso ponzu\n\nTLC Roll - tempura lobster & crab, whipped avocado, chili aioli\n\nIda Roll - smoked idaho trout, horseradish white soy\n\nGreen Roll - jumbo asparagus, roasted shiitakes.\nI totally enjoyed each roll but I'd have to say my fave was definitely the Tataki Roll.  It was so creamy and delicate and had a nice solid flavor with the tuna and ponzu.  This made for a great appetizer and is a great offering if you can't decide which Sensi Roll to get.  Each piece is a pretty substantial size.\n\nFamous Wok Lobster --  http://bit.ly/11dulIc\nChili & licorice glaze, baby bok choy, fried shallots.\nOMG!!  It was exactly like the how the pictures were with the interesting plating of the lobster.  This was amazing and the lobster was cooked perfectly.\n\nI wasn't too sure if I was going to order dessert but after seeing their dessert menu on their iPad, I was definitely tempted and settled with their Signature Tapioca Pudding\nhttp://bit.ly/14RPb2d\n\nSignature Tapioca Pudding with Mango Lassi and Coconut Sorbet -- http://bit.ly/11duonk\nThis was a pretty heavy dessert with a lot going on.  And everything was delicious!  Probably the best part though was the Coconut Sorbet.  It was so good!  This was a good dessert to finish off my meal since it had right amount of sweetness to counter the savory lobster taste.\n\nAfter an awesome experience like this, I'm definitely going to consider coming back here again.  It certainly lives up to the high standards of Bellagio's restaurant collection."

Luckily, our wait was only about 10 minutes, which we spent taking in the uber-modern decor consisting of rock wall waterfalls, black stone benches and chrome, brushed metal and frosted glass. We were seated right by the kitchen surrounded by glass at a table with a VIP vibe, seemingly secluded but still in the way of foot traffic.\n\nThe drinks were pretty good (blackberry currant seemed to be the favorite, while the asian persuasion left me needing to be persuaded to finish it), but the food was amazing. It's been months since I ate there so I can't remember exactly what was ordered but the curry was perfect, the cod was tasty, the spring rolls were okay, the tartare was not, ... that's really as far as I can remember.\n\nBottom line: great modern and natural atmosphere, service is attentive while not overbearing (even near closing! what a concept), appetizers aren't the best but the entrees are beautiful both on the plate and in your mouth. Eat here. Then be careful about partying too hard bc it'd be a shame to lose such a good dinner."

We always stay at the Bellagio and this place is fairly vegetarian friendly so it seemed like a no brainer.\n\nAs many here have commented, the nan bread is excellent. I enjoyed watching it being made, and then I really enjoyed eating it with the divine sauces. We wolfed the bread right down and were offered another basket, which we happily accepted.\n\nThe homemade ginger ale is refreshing and different. But it is very gingery. We liked it a lot, but I can see where it might not be for everyone.\n\nThe b/f started with the Yellowtail Sashimi, which he described as having an unusual combination of flavors. He liked it but didn't love it. I had the Tomato Burrata as my appetizer, which was WONDERFUL. The heirloom tomatoes were bursting with flavor. The tiny green beans were sweet and crispy. It had very little dressing - I think just salt, pepper, and olive oil, but that's all it needed. The spiciness of the arugula and the sweetness of the fresh basil gave this dish more than enough flavor for me. For those of you who don't know (I didn't) burrata is a cheese similar to fresh mozzarella but so much softer and creamier inside. Yum.\n\nFor my main course I tried the Vegetable and Egg Pad Thai. Not very original I know. This was a tad disappointing after my incredible appetizer. It seemed a little bland to me. Nothing special. I've had better Pad Thai elsewhere for a lot less $. Mr. Carnivore had the Tandoori Surf and Turf Mix Grill, which he enjoyed.\n\nDessert was the Sorbet and Gelato served in the bowl made of ice. I really, really loved this dessert! The presentation is fabulous, and each little scoop of sorbet and gelato was amazing. Each flavor (coconut, pineapple, and mango - I think?) complemented the others perfectly. I wanted to abscond with that ice bowl. So pretty and fun. I couldn't stop looking at it and touching it.\n\nService was top notch. Atmosphere is beautiful and unique.\n\nSo... I really enjoyed the overall experience. Some items were downright amazing (Tomato Burrata app and dessert). However a couple of the things we tried (Yellowtail Sashimi app and Pad Thai) were just OK, which makes this a 4 star review. But a very solid 4 stars. I was happy we came here."

My \"special\" 18 oz. bone-in ribeye was 10 ounces of fatty, unevenly cooked steak and 8 ounces of bone. The fact that it was $75 was just preposterous. Only in Vegas!\n\nThe service was middling.

During the most recent visit in March, I opted for their tasting menu.  Usually I find tasting menus to be a little more..creative and \"inspired.\"  At Sensi, I can't say it was, but it was a solid meal nonetheless.  It started off with a seared ahi sashimi for an amuse bouche.  First course then followed.  I chose the fall panzanella.  This one I wish I had chosen the cauliflower soup instead as the crab beignets that accompanied it looked very appetizing.  Then followed the second course of diver scallops I had picked.  Good.  The main entree I chose was the stone valley pork loin.  Good.  Lastly, it was dessert.  The time between the last entree and dessert was quite long, the only negative in the service area.  However, I was ok with the wait as the dessert was freshly made donuts and sweet frozen cappucino.  All in all, a very SENSible dinner that isn't a wallet buster for Vegas."

My husband and I arrived around 9 ish on a Saturday night, and we were seated quickly even  though we didn't have reservations. \n\nThe atmosphere is stylish and relaxing (appropriate for Bellagio's Spa Tower) and the restaurant itself is beautiful. When we walked in, we passed a tank of tasty-looking lobsters, and once seated we had a view of the kitchen. Even the place settings add to the sleek, spa like decor. The colors of the dining room: muted and sophisticated.\n\nThe best part about this was that despite the sophisticated atmosphere, the service was friendly, efficient, and not the least bit snooty. The folks there were among the best wait staff I've encountered in Vegas. \n\nWe started with house cocktails. I can't remember the name of the drink I ordered, but it was strong with a full ginger flavor, and very good ($14, the cost of all the Bellagio specialty cocktails I encountered at the pool, Fontana, the Petrossian Bar, etc.). The server then brought a fantastic little bread plate with several varieties of homemade bread and accompanying chutneys. \n\nWe then ordered the tempura fried asparagus (which I chose after reading the reviews on Yelp) and it lived up the hype. Fantastic! I wish I had some right now. We ordered appetizers and sides for our main course: A fantastic fried lobster dish with mango and micro greens; Duck pot stickers with foie gras on the side; and the Sensi fried rice. All of this was out of this world, truly delicious. If I went back, I'd get the lobster again, but I might get something else in place of the pot stickers ... just to keep it interesting.\n\nAfter all of this, the  waiter brought us a little complimentary box of cookies. They were tiny, tasty, and in the cutest to go box ever. \n\nI loved every minute of eating here. Plus, it was at the very start of my vacation when I was still full of optimism and my gambling budget. There may be some risk at the blackjack tables, but not in dining at Sensi! Worth every star."

While waiting for my friend to arrive, I was looking around and really dug the soft, intimate setting and d\u00e9cor. They gave me a cocktail menu on - get this - an iPad! Snazzy!\n\nI ordered the Black Crush cocktail which was the most delicious thing ever. I usually don't finish my drinks (I know...) but I finished this one :).\n\nWhen my friend arrived, we were greeted by two of the best servers. We weren't sure which was our server since both waited on us, but both reminded me of warm, funny uncles you'd see at family dinners. Just detailed, attentive service! \n\nFor bread, they brought out this delicious garlic naan with the best chutney dipping sauce. So good that I wanted to take some home with me but when I asked, they said they didn't bottle it. Management, if you're reading this, you should! \n\nAnyway, we ordered the TLC sushi roll to start, and an order of Scuna Bay Salmon to share. We were told the fish was really fresh and it was! \n\nWe even met a couple of nice neighbors next door, two colleagues that worked at Netflix and had a nice little chat with them. Gentlemen, if you're reading this, you still owe me a job offer! ;)\n\nAt the end of our meal, our \"uncles\" even gave us free truffles for dessert, which was quite nice as our male neighbors didn't get any! Haha. And they nicely packed bread and chutney for us in a fancy box, per our embarrassing request. All in all, a terrific meal and I would definitely return again while I'm in town.\n\nThe setting is very quiet, judging by how our neighbors could overhear our conversation and make conversation with us based on it, but it's okay because I guess that's what happens in Vegas!! The prices are also very reasonable, considering it's inside the Bellagio.\n\nHowever, I would recommend the restaurant more for couples than a large group as it's more romantic than \"fun.\" Just a nice place to have a quiet dinner.\n\n5 stars!

Not to mention, she was scooping Ice from the water on the table and putting it in her plastic to-go cup.. AND had her shoes off. This is SUPPOSED to be a classier restaurant.. NOT in and out burger!! What the hell am I paying for?!? The service was good, we could tell the waiter was doing the best he could with the poor situation he's stuck in. Ordered the salmon cracker appetizer, talk about gross. Salmon tasted old and more fishy then acceptable. For entrees I ordered ahi tuna rare and my boyfriend ordered scallops. Both seriously overcooked. The scallops were like rubber and my tuna was so dry I could barely eat it. We also ordered a side of tempura asparagus, which was greasy and soggy.. Much like something I would get at a Chinese food take out. PLEASE, save yourself from eating at this restaurant... Especially for the $$$, the place is worse than Applebee's.

The atmosphere is awesome, with a kitchen directly in the center of the restaurant, and nice asian-style touches throughout.  The service was literally impeccable...I couldn't have had a waiter that pleased more.  He was attentive and tailored the conversation to our interests without being overbearing.  The restaurant was happy to serve us dinner entrees at lunch, and really just catered to our every wish.  The pre-meal bread has changed now, and it's not the baked heaven that it once was, but it was still delicious.  The house-made ginger ale was really great, and I'd highly recommend it!  Overall, this was a great dining experience in every way."

            "review": "First, there are some outstanding dishes from sensi.  It's a cool concept restaurant combining Italian, Japanese, Thai, Indian, and Chinese. The complimentary bread basket with slices of naan bread and pappadam (fried version) with two dipping sauces (tamarind and raita) was unbelievably good and fresh - like straight from an oven. The other real good dish was the octopus salad - it had the softest, juiciest octopus pieces on a bed of greens and well seasoned roasted potatoes.  The small caper berries gave a nice acidic taste.\n\nThe main entrees were decent, but not at the current price point I think.  Miso glazed salmon was flavored well but slightly overcooked, and could have benefited with a side of white rice to balance out the richness.  This made us order a side of fried rice which wasn't too special.  The short rib and butternut squash ravioli was good and colorful, as was the tandoori butter chicken with basmati rice.  Chicken was very juicy - we've had tandoori chicken and butter chicken as separate dishes but never as a hybrid dish!  Both of these dishes were over $30 each though.\n\nFor dessert, the pistachio panna cotta was cold, smooth and delicious.  Had complex layers of berries and fruits between the green cream.  Presentation was absolutely beautiful.  \n\nService and ambiance were great, and I like the open kitchen in the center of the restaurant.  The bathroom despite having only one stall was very clean and sleek looking.  They do give you a free that of truffle chocolates when you leave, which is great.\n\nWould give more stars at a lower price point - since appetizers are almost as expensive as the entrees.  Cocktails are expensive ($14 each), but you can opt for their excellent homemade ginger ale ($6)."

An Indian man makes it on display in the kitchen.\n\nI had the filet and it was spot on.  My husband ordered the salmon.  I don't eat seafood but that dish was phenomenal.

This place definitely had a \"zen\" feel, especially with the modern-style kitchen based right in the middle of the restaurant, for everyone to see. \n\nI ordered the most expensive menu item, the 8oz free range tenderloin, and it was VERY disappointing, especially in comparison to the wonderful steak that i had the night before at Emeril's Delmonico. \n\ni prefer my steaks on the medium well side, and this one came out with absolutely no flavor. It was tough and uninspiring. The side dish included two large tater tots, also very disappointing. The tater tots from childhood have a more fulfilling, crunchy taste than these did. the asparagus was unremarkable.\n\nWe ordered a sample of appetizers, several of which were fine, but nothing special for the price of the meal. That said, several of my other friends did enjoy their appetizers and entrees, including one who raved about his Salmon. Perhaps I shouldn't have ordered red meat at a restaurant specializing in \"Asian Fusion\".\n\nThe wine list was nice and the service was excellent, and we felt \"cool\" being there, but for the price, I certainly will pass on Sensi on my next trip to the sin city."

The, when I pulled the seat out to sit my fingers grabbed a wad of gum instead. I pulled the gum off the chair and told the wait staff, but received no apology.  Our round table was set for six and we only had five and we had to ask twice for one of the chairs and settings to be removed. Our waiter changed three times during our meal and every time the new one came, it was as if we had just sat down because they didn't know any of what the previous waiter had done. The, two of the dishes we ordered were not available (I wonder how many other dishes were out?). The wait/bus staff continually bumped in to our chairs without apologies. There is apparently no training because the \"serve from the right, remove from the left\" standard was not followed and the staff often just reached across people to set or remove items. They even insert themselves between some of us hold a discussion. We brought the issues to the attention of the manager and said that we were not seeking a financial solution, but the manager took the bill away and ten minutes later the waiter brought the exact same bill back and dropped it on the table without word. \n\nTo be fair, the food is good and the restaurant is very beautiful in a modern way. \n\nBut, the terrible service factor ruins the entire experience. Go somewhere else as there are many other places well worth your money in Las Vegas."

Somm Ernie picked out a wonderful Cremont sparkler from France to help us celebrate two birthdays in our party of 5 while we checked out the interesting menu. Ordered some nice appetizers of crisp fried shrimp, steamed buns with duck confit, and wagyu beef tongue with veal cheeks. The Somm paired up this offering with a crisp French Sancerre. We had brought a Rochioli East Block Pinot Noir to have with dinner and the Somm expertly chilled it down to the proper temperature until we were ready for it. For the entrees, we decided to try \"family style\" with the Roasted Octopus, Sea Bass, Miso Salmon, Pork Chop, and sides of Fried Rice and Brussel Sprouts. A second bottle of Pinot Noir - this one from Bethel Heights (OR) was suggested to finish off the meal while contemplating desserts. For the dessert the crew put together a sampling tower which included all sorts of delectable treats. A most extraordinary dinner and we will definitely be back.

A meticulous planner, my dinner reservations going into Vegas were mapped out months in advance and my breakfast details planned out extensively.  While my lunches were unscheduled, I generally knew where I wanted to go and generally went there.  When my best friend decided at the last minute that Enoteca San Marco wasn't something he was interested in and suggested \"something asian maybe\" I remembered hearing good things about Sensi and turned to it as an alternative since my buddy had been so agreeable to places like MiX and Alex which weren't really his \"scene.\"  Tucked in the back of Bellagio and pretty tough to find, unfortunately Sensi wasn't tough enough to find.\n\nSeated immediately near the admittedly awesome bread prep station, our 'waiter' Jeremy W briefly asked \"sparkling or flat\" and my friend stated flat.  We were brought an already opened bottle of Fiji and two glasses of ice.  When I suggested tap water would be fine, the 'waiter' stated \"Well, the bottle is already opened.\"  The bottle cost $8 and was not comped despite our not wanting it.  Approximately ten minutes later menus were brought and essentially dropped off without explanation.  The waiter then returned approximately 10 minutes later with some Naan to go with our empty condiments (every other table was served fresh soy, salt, mustard, and tomato pepper chutney with their Naan...I had to stand up and get my own.  Orders were taken and this was the last we'd see of Jeremy until he delivered the bill.\n\nBrowsing the restaurant I must admit the d\u00e9cor was beautiful and watching the chef prepare the Naan was interesting.  After one basket of the delightful and doughy yet crisp bread topped with spicy chutney a non-descript server arrived and removed our basket, later returning with fresh bread.  This was the best service we received at Sensi.  \n\nAfter around 20 minutes our mains arrived, myself ordering Oven Roasted Diver Scallops with Basil Risotto, Zucchini, and Eggplant and my friend opting for the Shrimp and Beef with Duck Fried Rice.  All things being equal, the food was decent but certainly no better than I've had at far cheaper restaurants with vastly better service.  My scallops were a tad overdone but certainly fresh and tasty while the Risotto was soft yet consistent and contrasted well with the vegetables.  My friend additionally noted his dish was \"pretty good.\"  Portion sizes were adequate but certainly not excessive considering the $20+ pricetags.\n\nAnother 15-20 minutes passed after the meal and thankfully I was seated close to the server's station where I was capable of filling my own glass with tap water because during that time no on arrived at our table.  Eventually Jeremy reappeared and without asking about dessert or anything else he delivered the check and collected our dishes.  \"Have a great day\" he said.  To be fair, it wouldn't have taken much to be a great day after such a disappointing meal with such lousy service.  The total bill was $56.03 and our most affordable meal of the trip.  No tip was left as no tip was deserved...I've had better service at Denny's.  \n\nThe only plus of the meal was that on the way back to the sportsbook and gaming floor we had to pass by the beautiful Bellagio gardens and Jean-Philippe where I ordered the best Tiramisu I've ever had.  Moral of the story?  If you're on your way to Sensi just stop, grab some tiramisu and gelato and watch the chocolate fountain."

The setting is quite neat with a combination of unique open kitchen styled environment and a softer water/fountain backdrop. Service is solid with good knowledge of the cuisine. That being said, many of the appetizers were not prepared to standard and even the waiter had to comment that some of our dishes were of poor quality and needed further time to prepare. At that point, he did offer an additional appetizer to pass the time, but should have compensated us on the misstep (remember this is considered a \"higher end\" establishment). Overall, the appetizers lacked creativity and in many cases were just poor (e.g. a version of Chinese buns). That being said, the Naan bread was good and the sauces had some nice flavor.\n\nThe main courses were generally Meh. The salmon, crispy skin style preparation, lacked flavor and a unique presentation. I really thought it was a poor dish. The wines were excellent, but I found the Sommelier just OK. He really didn't have a good understanding of the wines but their wine list was varied and had both value and premium selections.\n\nI did appreciate the fact they host children under the age of six. This is a rarity in Las Vegas and should be noted. \n\nEnjoy Las Vegas!"

As you know, I'm all about the high and low.\n\nWe stopped by for an early dinner before our flight out.  The decor is light maple wood along with stainless steel and loads of granite.  Very modern, yet organic at the same time.  \n\nLocation was odd, by the Bellagio hotel elevators and bypassing the spa and conservatory area.  Just out of place.  Placement is key and Sensi is like a fish out of water.  \n\nThe energy in the restaurant was not like the hip trendy ones, but definitely more along the lines of business casual.  \n\nSensi translates to the 'senses' in Italian.  It's a fusion of Southeast Asian, American, Japanese and Italian flavors.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  The menu is vast ranging from pizzas to sushi to pasta.  We decided to do family style and mostly appetizers:\n\nWine ain't cheap here.\nPinot Grigio $12\nReisling $18\n\nKobe Carpaccio $19 \nSlices of thin meat wrapped around a potato croquette and generous shavings of parmesan.  Loved the textures and flavors.  Nice change from the traditional version paired with toast.\n\nLobster Rolls $20\nPresented in a block of ice and stuffed with fresh crab and lobster.  Slightly spicy and delicious! \n\nTataki & Tartar $20 \nTuna in disguised three ways: tartar, tataki, and spicy.\n\nAngry Scallops $19\n8 pieces of raw scallops trembling ever so slightly before us.  \n\nMalaysian Satay $15\nThe only disappointment.  Generous portions, but just a little too much cumin and the meat reminded me of ground meat slapped on a stick.  \n\nChocolate Temptation $10\nCake with fudge on the inside, a milkshake with a chocolate straw and ice cream.  Tiny, scrumptious and delightful.  \n\nYou know what I hate about most Asian fusions??!?!  No FREE bread, yeah, yeah it's ASIAN, throw me some free ANYTHING: a bowl of rice, edamame.

Research SPECIFIC DISHES you want to order as \"sensi\" is also apparently Vegas-speak for \"inconsistent\". Some dishes were serious knock-outs and some were not much better than my time at the blackjack tables.\n\nWTF is so good about the famous ginger ale? It was way too sour -- it tasted like unsweetened lemonade with a heavy dose of ground ginger. Maybe that's how the Italians like it, but I couldn't finish it.\n\nWe had several dishes from the prix fixe menu. The naan was good, but it was burnt (yes, literally, black char marks) and kind of unspecial. The cucumber, tomato-jalape\u00f1o and sweet chutneys were tasty. The crispy shrimp tasted disappointingly like any other fried food and the flat iron steak was both unremarkable and inconsistently cooked. But, the chicken in creamy butter curry sauce kicked some serious ass... order it (especially if you like chicken tikka masala)! Beware the wine pairings -- they were good pairs, but by my math it would have been cheaper to order 3oz pours of each pairing rather than go with the prix fixe pricing.\n\nGotta give a special WTF to the tater tots. F---ing tater tots... seriously? They do not belong. \"Dear Sensi: If you'd told me the tater tots were pakoras I would have LOVED them. You're an Indian restaurant (excuse me, Asian-fusion restaurant), not Denny's. Please edit accordingly.\"\n\nDesserts were good, and the gelato/sorbet's ice bowl is a stunning conversation piece. The coconut gelato, according to Mrs. WTF, tasted like frozen Hawaiian Tropic, and not in a good way. The salted caramel ice cream is uniquely delicious.\n\nAnd yes, fine dining + Vegas = expensive. But the service is attentive and Sensi's prices are not out of whack with other quality alternatives. WTF did you expect?"

I mean, it is almost library quiet.  That's a wee bit odd for a Vegas restaurant.  \n2)  There is only 1 stall per sex.  This means there is a line constantly...and it wasn't all that clean.  \n\nOther than that, this place is spot on.  The decor is pretty and fun.  The staff is attentive and friendly.

            "review": "We had an amazing one year anniversary dinner here!  I made reservations a few months in advance, since the Virtuoso Conference was taking place at Bellagio this week, and the restaurant closes for renovations next week.  Sporting my new necklace, aptly named the Showstopper, Eric R. escorted me to the beautiful Sensi restaurant.  We had Chef Ellamar's food before at a Project Dinner Table a few years ago, but had never been in the restaurant.  I also knew before ever entering that this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in terms of design.  We were seated in a beautiful room at a table facing the glass kitchen - what a great view!\n\nImmediately, Sanae, the Head Sommelier, brought us Gruet champagne as a celebratory gesture for our anniversary.  We almost had visited Gruet winery in Albuquerque on Monday, but ran out of time!  I decided to go with the tasting menu, and Eric R. decided to go a la carte.  He ordered the Roll Call appetizer, with a sample of each sushi roll (trout, salmon, tuna, and lobster), and the halibut with corn risotto and charred tomato vinaigrette.  My selections on the tasting menu included the kusshi oyster with ponzu and sriracha, roasted octopus, the Thai diver scallop with jasmine rice and bok choy, kalbi marinated kobe flat iron steak with bone marrow and kimchi with mashed potato, and strawberry shortcake with basil.\n\nOur server (I believe his name is Lawrence) was great.  He promised to alternate my courses with Eric's so we could have food at all times and sample each other's.  First, we received the famous bread basket with naan, papadums, cucumber raita, and tomato chutney.  As I anticipated from Misti Y.'s and Bobby Y.'s reviews, we were addicted to the tomato chutney...and refilled the chutney and the basket!  Then, the chef generously sent out oysters for each of us though only I was supposed to get one.  The kusshi are small and flavorful and the sauce was perfect!  Who doesn't love ponzu?  So fresh!  Sanae helped us choose a wine for the meal.  We split a glass of white from Santorini Greece that she recommended, and it was flavorful and easy to drink.\n\nThen Eric received his roll call.  He let me try a bite of one with ikura but I wanted him to enjoy his appetizer, which he definitely did.  He loved the tuna roll.  Next, I received my roasted octopus, adorned with fried capers, roasted red pepper, roasted potatoes, and strands of radicchio.  I love grilled octopus and roasted did not disappoint.  The restaurant generously provided potstickers also, which Eric enjoyed.  Then I received my scallop, which had a chile paste flavor (which I love), delicious charred haricort vert, and bok choy with radish sprouts.  The scallop was HUGE and perfectly cooked.  Then, Eric received his halbut (perfectly cooked also) and it was delicious and moist.\n\nNext I got my steak which was presented beautifully and secretly pre-sliced which made my life easier!  It was very tasty.  We were so full so we got what was left to go, knowing dessert was next.  Besides my shortcake, the restaurant gave us three other treats: donuts, raspberry-rhubarb mousse, and a chocolate caramel dessert.  Wow!  We were so full.  Then our server gave us chocolates and told us the meal was taken care of already by someone else!  It turns out my parents arranged with Sensi to surprise us!  It was such a shock - we were so surprised.  What a delicious and special experience to cap off a year of wedded bliss!  Thanks to Sensi, especially the manager, sommelier Sanae, our server Lawrence, and Chef Ellamar...and my parents!"

After much deliberation about where to go for dinner, we decided to try Sensi.  We remember it as the restaurant with the waterfall with a quirky Prix Fixe Menu.  \n\nWe didn't have reservations, but it was a few days before the CES chaos so we were seated withing 10 minutes.  My wife read about the wonderful Ginger Ale, so we decided to give that a try.  Let's just say, we both didn't like it too much.  It was a bit too spicy for a drink, so we both stuck mostly with water.\n\nWe ordered from the Prix Fixe menu.  I had the Surf and Turf Beef Carpaccio, the Kobe Flat Iron Steak, and Sorbet.  While waiting for the food, we were served some Naan with sauce.  Usually, we would skip the Naan, but these had a nice crispy texture that we couldn't resist.  \n\nThe Surf and Turf Carpaccio was delicious.  It consisted for tasty but not chewy Lobster with a delicious Mustard Dressing.  The Flat Iron Steak was ok.  The Steak and the Bok Choy looked a little lonely on the big plate they serve it in.  I've had better elsewhere, but it was good nonetheless.  The dessert was awesome.  The Sorbet came in a big ice sculpture shaped like a water drop.  Delicious mango and lemon flavors went well with the after dinner coffee.  \n\nAll in all, we were extremely satisfied with our mean.  Would definitely go back again."

We were stressed out, tired, a little angry because our reservations had gotten mixed up, but by the time we left this place the mood totally changed. Sensi has a really cool layout, a kitchen with glass walls so you can see what's going on in there, nice enough servers. The one thing that made it for me was the INCREDIBLE CARPACCIO. I mean, that stuff was some gooooood  stuff... The rest was very good but restaurants in SF are very good too... but this carpaccio; I've yet to find better. I came back from my trip in July a carpaccio-hound. I looked for it everywhere I go and now I order it whenever I see it. The only comparable carpaccio was in Santa Rosa, and I'm kicking myself for not remembering the name of the place. But geez... customer service in Vegas is great, but our food in SF and our Wine Country is OFF THE CHAIN. Still... gotta love this place. I can't wait to go back."

This will be a reflection of a one star review. \n\nPros:\n- the ambiance and looks/feel of the restaurant (although this can be completely deceiving)\n- the naan and dipping sauces in the beginning of the dinner \n\nCons:\n- the service. Our waiter was completely rude and neglectful. I ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer in the beginning to start off my meal. No where on the menu did it mention that this dish would be spicy. NO WHERE. The dish came and had four shrimps and on the shrimp were ginger and a slice of pepper. Knowing that I can't eat spicy food, I took OFF the ginger and the pepper.  But sure enough, it was spicy. So spicy that I had to spit out the food! The waiter came back to ask us how we were doing and I said that I didn't like the appetizer and it was too spicy. The waiter then proceeded to tell me that I probably shouldn't have ate the ginger and pepper with it and that was probably what made it spicy. I told him I didn't and he looks at me, smirked and took the plate away. \n\n-our food. I ordered the butter chicken with rice and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the special of the night. A bone in steak. My food was bland and I didn't even eat 1/4 of it while my fianc\u00e9 liked his and ate most of it. And I took a few bites of his... \n\n-the service (again). Our waiter checked in on us  ONCE when our food came out and disappeared the rest of the evening. The busboy gave us more attention than our \"waiter\".  We had to ask the busboy for our check and it took 20 mins later to finally receive it. The \"waiter\" did not check in to offer us dessertts. It was my fianc\u00e9 birthday and I made note of it when making reservations... I couldn't even order a dessert for  his birthday dinner. \n\n- aftermath. We went to  watch \"O\"  after our dinner. When we were leaving Bellagio, I started to feel ill.. I told my fianc\u00e9 this and he said that maybe I  will feel better when we got back to our room. This did not happen. Infact, my fianc\u00e9 woke up at 4AM ill as well. We were sick for the remainder of the night. \n\n\nI usually don't write reviews, but I was so upset with Sensi that I felt the need to disclose and forewarn others about my experience. I will never go back to Sensi and I will be following up with the food department of Nevada. I've never felt that sick in my life. And for them to ruin our dining experience and then our night? Wow... Spend your hard earn money elsewhere!!!"

Desserts were ok but I will talk more about that later. \n\nEven though the food selection was small, their drink choice was not! They had one of the biggest wine lists I have even seen! Lots of mixed drinks but beer selection was poor and nothing on tap! WTF!?!! \n\nThe service was ok but the waitress was boring...she never smiled and she had very little energy. It was almost like she didn't care because she was getting a tip anyway from our party. However, they did bring my gf their signature dessert.

Every one like it and I will try to post pics later. \n\nHowever, I will say that the ladies at the front desk were really nice.  We originally had reservations at 7pm but called to have it moved to 8pm with no problem.  Half of the party didn't show up until after 8:30pm but they still sat us anyway.

Two of us had the prix fixe menu, and two of us went a la carte.\nThe halibut was just so so (kind of bland), but the scallops were delicious.  \nThe atmosphere, and the desserts served in ice bowls, are quite enjoyable."

            "review": "I'm not much of a foodie. And I'm not a fan of Indian food. Oh, and I don't know much about wine. So how come the Indian-inflected, wine-paired prix fixe menu at this classy spot was the best meal we ate in Vegas?\n\nThe three-course prix fixe is $59, and the wine pairing is, I believe, another 30 bucks. It's a treat for sure, but it's a reasonable treat. To be honest, ordering a la carte here would give me pause; it's a whole different price point.\n\nWe started with a basket of naan and pappadums, which the server felt compelled to explain. The naan was amazing, and you can watch a chef in the glass-enclosed kitchen making it all evening. This is accompanied by four sauces; the tomato chutney is by far the best, although a semi-spicy sweet chili dip is yummy too.\n\nHusband's crunchy shrimp app was light and flavorful and beautifully presented. I had a bite (for research purposes) and moved on to my market salad, which was a nice combo of greens, excellent parmesan, candied pecans in an unobtrusive vinaigrette. And, holy Gruner Veltliner, Batman--that wine pairing was perfect.\n\nMains: Husband had the flatiron steak, which he praised, along with the pickled onions and \"tater tots.\" My curried chicken came with basmati and raita; the buttery sauce was so good that I surreptitiously dropped bits of naan into the bowl to soak up more. Again, the wine, a shiraz blend with a goofy name, scored big flavor points.\n\nFor dessert, we both went for the chocolate thingy that's basically the best Kit-Kat bar you'll ever eat. It came with a scoop of ice cream that was not particularly flavorful, but who cares? The port that accompanied this course did all the heavy lifting.\n\nThe service is a bit old-school (i.e. napkins placed in laps, wine lists presented to the gentlemen), but not stuffy at all. I think they have to deal with a lot of tourists who are in over their heads, but they do so graciously. The waiter beamed at our praise, as if he was dying to run into the kitchen and convey the news.\n\nThe surroundings are, in a word, gorgeous. The other high-end restaurants at the Bellagio look formal, even a bit overdone and self-conscious. Sensi looks rugged and natural, minimalist but not cold. Rough-hewn stone, light wood, walls of waterfalls, inviting bar, various dining rooms tucked away. Being able to watch the chefs at work is an entertaining plus."

I do remember, however, that it seemed pretty standard, no flavors that were truly astounding. I got the shrimp tacos, which were absolutely amazing. 3 Little shrimp tacos in a very flaky crust with a great sweet sauce.\n\nDinner was good. I had some sort of meat combination that had chicken, fish, and steak, combined with naan and some curry. all of it was well prepared and the flavors were clean. The naan was the best part, it was a great garlicky naan that had a really good flavor. Fiancee had the short rib, which was good, but definitely not the best short rib I'd ever tried (she agreed with this assessment)\n\nA couple of bad points - waiters were very courteous, but it felt like the whole meal was a bit rushed, especially given that the restaurant wasn't that crowded (we were done in a little over an hour, and that's because we were taking our time as much as possible). Also, I think the place is a bit overpriced, total bill was 170 before tip, and given that we only had 3-4 drinks with our meal, for what we were served, it just seemed a bit high."

The place is very pretty, with the kitchen open to view behind glass, and rock and granite walls with water washing over them.  \n\nWe ate our way through oysters, Kobe beef carpaccio, a green salad (that cost $18! - give me a break), a lovely duck confit and Colorado lamb.  Portions, as noted in other reviews, are small, but tasty. The service was typical Vegas obsequious, including my pet peeve - calling customers \"you guys\".  There was a very long wait between the appetizers and main course, which was somewhat annoying.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, but the server presented us with a little take away box with some fabulous cookies.  Nice touch.\n\nNot sure if I'd go again, but if someone else is paying for it - what the hell, why not?"

Melting little pillows of deliciousness but with a slightly, crunchy crust on one side where they must have been sauteed a bit.

If you have a group, try to get this table, as I think it is certainly the most interesting in the house. We all shared a variety of dishes, the highlight being the lobster rolls, which are served on a large block of ice. The only food I thought was lackluster that the dessert.

I never would have paired them but they were delicious.  The best, though, was the signature lobster appetizer.  A wonderful mix of components with a fantastic sauce.  The appetizer portions were generous.\n\nThey price their wines 'way above usual restaurant markups so we settled for two $16 glasses of $16 Oregon Pinot Noir.\n\nWe opted for the lemon drop dessert (I'd anything with lemon on it).

            "review": "It's too bad that I've taken so long in getting around to writing a review of Sensi, so unless you trust my long-term memory, I'd suggest ignoring most of this review and just going with the recommendation to eat here. I mean, even if you only spend one night in Vegas, this is where you should have dinner. And I should know: I went to two restaurants when I was there, and this one was better.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, Sensi was my first (yes, of two) introduction to the fancy restaurant scene in Vegas. I'd heard a lot about various famous chefs opening new restaurants here, but I figured rather than Nobu Next Door these places would be more like Nobu Up The Block And Around The Corner And Then Take Your Third Left After The Light. In short, I expected mediocre food at exorbitant prices. At Sensi, neither was the case. \n\nFirst of all, I for the most part do not care about decor. As long as I'm not knocking knees with another diner, I feel fine with a chair at a table. But this place is so cool. It's very modern and sleek but in a warm way, which is to say you don't get the feeling that your very presence might be ruining the otherwise super cool atmosphere. There's a lot of smooth gray rock all over the place, and water falling down it. It's clean and pleasant. \n\nAnd the food is delicious. We had a tuna three ways to start--raw, raw, raw--and it was unique and very tasty. I say \"unique\" because I have several times ordered tuna only to remember, Oh, right, I've had this a million times before. This one tasted like someone actually put some effort into it. We also had a calamari dish, not deep-fried but the sauteed kind, which is much more interesting to me, which came with this amazing lightly breaded cooked tomato. The combination of flavors was lovely and impressive in that it seemed creative but was not at all overpowering. \n\nSensi is some kind of fusion between Indian and Japanese and maybe a few other things. Typically the idea of fusion drives me nuts; when I have a PB&J sandwich for dinner with a side of leftover pad thai, I don't go around saying I just made myself a Thai-American fusion meal. But I think they do a pretty good job at Sensi of making everything well enough so that they earn the right to serve different kinds of foods. I guess we started with Japanese? Anyway, for entrees we chose two different kinds of curry, a red shrimp curry and a chicken tikka masala. The latter was sub-standard, by which I mean that it didn't taste as good as chicken tikka masala at my local Indian favorite. But the shrimp was great--and I don't even like shrimp that much! It was high quality (i.e. it actually tasted like something) and it came in this awesome little coconut bowl (real, I think), and the rice was delicious and we got naan bread that was, as good naan bread is, out of this world.\n\nI don't remember the desserts as being that great, but I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to desserts. If it's too sweet I don't like it, if there's orange flavor I don't like it, if there's chocolate mixed with cherry I don't like it. Probably it's a good idea to skip dessert and just buy some Mrs. Fields cookies on your way back to the slot machines."

I told him what type of cocktail I was looking for (tequila) and he suggested a drink with tequila, cherry brandy, muddled cherries, lime, etc.  I can't remember the name but it was very good.  My boyfriend had bourbon and they were generous with the pour.\n\nWhen the naan bread came out, I figured out what everyone had been talking about.  And the tomato chutney... to die for!  I pretty much knew I wanted to try the TLC Roll, because every other Yelper has made it clear it's phenomenal.  Totally right on that front- amazing!  I also had the ricotta ravioli.  The plates were small but great for sharing.  My boyfriend had the filet, and it was cooked perfectly medium-rare.  He also orderd the loaded mashed potatoes, which were really decadent.  We opted out on dessert but were brought a trio of ice cream/sorbet anyway since I mentioned we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  Really thoughtful.  I may still be dreaming about the pistachio ice cream, and I don't even like pistachios.  It was seriously that good!\n\nThe bill was pricy but I do believe you get what you pay for.

The open kitchen is the center of attention here. We were seated near the lobster tank, but thankfully, I didn't see or hear any lobsters being cooked. \n\nIf I come back again, I'll give their prix-fixe menu a try. Seems that would be the best way to go here."

It was a bit slow but I have found this trip to Vegas every place had slow service. I ordered scallops (which I was nervous about, I love scallops but they can be dangerous) my friend ordered the sea bass and both of our husbands ordered steak.  My friend and I shared the scallops and sea bass that we ordered.  The food was good at the time.  We went to \"O\" and it was phenomenal.  Not too long after that my friend and I didn't feel well so we called it a night. The next morning we found out that we had been up all night sick! We called the manager at Sensi to let them know what happened. He of course wanted to know what else we had eaten that day and was looking for ANY other reason we could have gotten sick.  He said he will have to look into it and call us back. We never did get a call back and quite frankly they didn't really seem to care.  SO we were dismissed by the management at SENSI.  I would recommend ANY other place to eat. We spent $300 and for that you have a ton of options!!"

Jean-Philippe's desserts are amazingly decadent, and Sensi's outward appearance is just drab (except for that waterfall fountain that gently trickles down the stone wall; it just BEGS for me to touch it. ...that's what she said).\n\nAhem.\n\nAnyway, I had dinner here a while ago and it was incredible. The food is considered Asian fusion, but they've got a variety of cuisines that are all done very well. What I had (a seafood risotto) is no longer on the menu, but it did leave an impression on me, so that should say something. The sommeliers are incredibly helpful and lack all the pretentiousness that comes with being a wine snob (which, technically, they are).\n\nThe service is great (water glasses constantly being attended to, napkins being folded upon your return from the restroom) and the prices match the level of service and quality of food.\n\nThe setting is something else. You're surrounded by carved stone and water trickling and have a view of the kitchen. It's best seen in-person as my words lack the beauty of the place.\n\nGorgeous setting, delicious \"Asian-fusion\" eats, attentive service: what more could you ask for?"

Instead, pick your favorite of the following two:\n\n\"My Evening at Sensi\"\n\n    --- or ---\n\n\"Attack of the Insane Drunk Ladies\"\n\nNow that I have that squared away, onto the review!  \n\nI had reservations for 1 on Saturday night at Sensi at the Bellagio.  Since I was flying solo, I decided to sit at the bar, which was stylish and contemporary, with lots of granite and dark woods and a waterfall.  Unfortunately, in contrast to the other high-end restaurants in the Bellagio, Sensi doesn't have any walls or doors or other barriers separating the interior of the restaurant from the foot traffic and general pandemonium happening in the common areas -- so my hopes for a serene dinner were dashed before I even started eating.\n\nAfter ordering a Sauvignon blanc (excellent!) and noshing on the complementary breadbasket of naan and curry-flavored chips, I decided dinner would be the \"Taste of Sensi\" tasting menu.  Here's the rundown:\n\nAMUSE BOUCHE\nSalmon cracker with nori crisps, kaffir smoked salmon, and wasabi avocado.  Lovely presentation, but far too salty/briny for my taste.  Not enjoyable.\n\nCOURSE #1\nRoasted octopus with chorizo, fingerling potatoes, arugula salad, egg yolk, and squid ink aioli.  Similar to the amuse bouche, this dish was beautiful to look at, but all I could taste was salt.  I picked it at, but didn't finish it.\n\nCOURSE #2\nAlaskan halibut with fennel, sweet corn, broken rice, asparagus, and peas.  Hands down my favorite dish of the night.  The halibut was cooked to perfection, and I loved the texture of the intermingled broken rice, corn, and peas.\n\nCOURSE #3\n\"Tongue & Cheek\" -- braised veal cheeks, smoked Wagyu beef tongue, potato puree, and red wine reduction.  Great flavors and beautifully cooked meats, but I was a bit blind-sided by the enormous portion of very rich ingredients, which seemed out of place in a tasting menu sequence.  I guess I can't complain about too much of a good thing, right?\n\nDESSERT\nGreek yogurt panna cotta with honey gelee and blackberry coulis.  SIlky smooth but overwhelmingly sweet.  A few bites and the sugar rush became too much to handle.\n\nWhile the food was a mixed bag, the real \"highlight\" of the evening (if you can call it that) was being accosted by a pair of insane drunk ladies** (IDLs) who stumbled in from the casino, sat down next to me, GRABBED MY UTENSILS OUT OF MY HANDS, and helped themselves to my food.  Jeeeeeezus H. Christ!\n\nI begged and pleaded with the bartender to do something about the IDLs, but he shrugged and did a whole lot of nothing.  Eventually the IDLs got bored of me and moved on to greener pastures...but my appetite was mostly ruined at that point.  I was hoping the bartender could comp at least part of my meal that had been rendered inedible by the IDLs' creeper-germs, but he refused.  Instead, he poured me a free glass of Sauvignon blanc in a to-go cup, which was a nice gesture, but nowhere near enough to make up for a spoiled dinner.  Needless to say, I quickly paid my check and got the hell out of there.\n\nAnd thus ends my tale of Sensi -- possibly the strangest and randomest experience I've ever had as a solo diner in Vegas (or anywhere else).  \n\n-----\n\n**Footnote: I didn't call them ladies at the time.  I used a much less family-friendly term... You can probably guess what it was."

The Sommelier's wine selection was spot on (better be for $30 a glass!).  Presentation is perfect.  I recommend that you go early on a weeknight.  It can be very noisy when crowded with drunk gamblers.  Go for a semi-splurge or if you're comped.  I consider it better than all the other outrageous restaurants (except Picasso).  Ok, ok, mea culpa, we were comped both times."

They gave us two baskets of their nicely seasoned naan bread that comes with four dipping sauces. I can't remember what all of them were, but the sweet chili sauce was my favorite. Yum!\n\nFor appetizer we ordered the beef tenderloin carpaccio that is served on top of horseradish potatoes and sprinkled with pecorino cheese. It was pretty good and definitely different from the other beef carpaccios that I've had before. One of my friends ordered the prix fixe menu which came with the crispy shrimp ( Rice Flake Crust, Calamansi Mayonnaise, Buddah Hand Citrus) for appetizer. We all got to try some and it reminded us of Captain Crunch cereal with a nice citrusy flavor which I liked. I also ordered the Plymouth Rock cocktail, easy on the gin, which was delicious and matched the color of my dress. \n\nFor dinner one of my friends and I shared the Live Maine Lobster and the signature braised short ribs. Both were really good. My other friend ordered the potato gnocchi which came with slow roasted pork, San Marzano yomatoes, mint, and pine nuts. The pork was tender on the inside with a nice crispy outer layer which was pretty good as well. The halibut and spice rubbed chicken in butter curry sauce that other friends ordered looked pretty good as well and there weren't any complaints from anyone.\n\nFor dessert the prix fixe menu came with the chocolate tempation (Layers of Silky Milk Chocolate, Nuts & Pralin\u00e9 Salted Caramel Ice Cream). Yum! I love chocolate and the salted caramel ice cream really complimented the cake. My other friend ordered the chocolate soufle while one of my friends and I both ordered their gelato which was served in a teardrop shaped bowl carved out of ice. We got to choose three flavors each, I got the Tahitian vanilla bean, pistachio, and white chocolate espresso (all of which were good, my fav was white chocolate espresso) and my friend got the Tahitian vanilla bean, mango-passionfruit, and coconut.\n\nThis place is a bit pricey, but definitely worth the $84 I paid for dinner.

The host was very kind and made small talk while walking us to our table and she genuinely wished us a great dining experience. The server was also very kind. We decided to order from the appetizer menu and try a variety of items. I hate to say that the only appetizer I enjoyed was the tuna sashimi. It was very fresh, perfect taste and the mustard seeds complemented the dish nicely. The lobster crab rolls didn't rock my boat as they tasted slightly to salty. I also tried the cauliflower soup which had pickled cauliflower as the meaty portion of the soup and a luke warm cauliflower blend soup. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be like warm as I know that there can be chilled soups, but it wasn't chilled either.  I hope that the main entrees are better. The restaurant is beautiful with a 360 degree view of the kitchen enclosed in glass. Large slabs of stone and water features create a spa and earthy ambiance but the over head lighting at my table was quite bright, brighter than I wished as it made my plates and silverware difficult to look at. Over all if I went back I would try an entree, but considering that I didn't enjoy the appetizers I question if I should come back."

            "review": "Dear Lucky Stars, Thank you for this Valentine's Dinner. Oh, and thank you husband too. Disclaimer: I think I may have had a once in a lifetime meal this evening! \n\nI realize that Martin Heierling is the executive chef, but to recreate this experience, you definitely need to make sure Chef de Cuisine Roy is in the kitchen. After eating his creations, I think he may be the most underrated guy on the Strip. \n\nWhen I walked in, I was immediately impressed (and frightened) by the size of the exhibition kitchen. I thought it must be impossible for anyone to manage all of these kitchens effectively, and then I became worried that perhaps the ambitious kitchen would undermine the quality of the food. As you may have guessed, my worries were unfounded.\n\nLittle things make me happy, so I could have eaten the naan/papadum breadbasket and homemade chutneys all night long. This alone is worth five stars... my favorite breadbasket, no contest. We consumed so much chutney that we had to get refills, and by the end of the evening, the husband was using the tomato chutney with everything brought to the table, including his steak. I personally wanted a jar of the raita to take home in my purse, but my purse was too small. The flavor was like India in a cup, and India tastes delicious. The papdum were perfect. \n\nFirst course: Oysters. One cold, one hot. Time for a confession. This was the first oyster I have ever eaten! I have a low tolerance for seafood, meaning if something is not uber fresh, it makes me ill. I have always been afraid to try an oyster because of this, but the cold oyster with a citrus sauce was brilliant. Somehow I know this isn't your average oyster.\n\nSecond course: yellowtail sashimi. When yellowtail is fresh, it may be one of my favorite things in the world, but it is rare to find it as fresh as I like. Needless to say, it tasted like they had just caught the fish. I could have been on the boat eating it. It was that fresh. Not the slightest fishy taste to be detected. \n\nThird course: Duck dumpling with foie gras. The only travesty here is that there was just one. Even so, it packed a big, scrumptious punch. \n\nFourth course: Mini Thai coconut soup with shrimp and boba. Yes, I said boba. The flavor was what every coconut soup wished it could be, but when you add boba? That's just not fair. \n\nFor my main entree, I went with the Thai scallops and the husband ordered the 14oz Piedmontese ribeye. At this point, I was pretty stuffed, but the scallops were buttery and curried, a magic combination. I had a bite of the husband's steak, and it tasted like the stored memory of steak, the ultimate steak, the perfect form of steak to be down right Pluto-esque about it. \n\nI wasn't sure if I could make it through dessert, but it was hard to resist a tribute to a McDonald's Apple Pie. My husband busted out into laughter. It was that good.\n\nWhen we left, I said, \"Wow, that was better than Alex,\" and I meant it. I feel as if we experienced the ultimate Sensi experience. It may be hard to recreate, but I think it is worth a try."

Perhaps its because \"Asian Fusion\" sounds gimmicky, but I'm very glad that we chose to dine here. My dinner here was very satisfying. \n\nWe ordered a TLC roll and a tasting menu for dinner. Because both of us were not very hungry, we decided to have a quick dinner and share everything. \n\nThe TLC Role was pretty good. My recommendation is to get Roy's tasting menu. Everything on there was delicious and well worth the price (about 90 dollars). The scallops, pork chop, donut dessert, and sashimi was all delicious (that was our choices for our tasting menu). \n\nThe service was impeccable. I was just so pleasantly surprised by this restaurant because it was never on my radar, but everything was spot on and delicious. \n\nThe kitchen is open so you get to see them make your food. The nan bread is complementary and a great way to start the dinner. \n\nThe standout dish for me was the Pork chops. So flavorful, tender and just plain scrumptious.\n\nThe one sole critique (very very minor) is that our scallops were over seasoned. Chunks of salt took away the delicateness of scallops.\n\nWell done Sensi and Roy."

Sensi is one of those places, cutting edge very trendy places. Trendy can be fun but not at the expense of service. The restaurant was not particulalry crowded, we had a revervation at 8 and these ladies that looked like fashion models made us wait. We aren't a showy family but my teenagers were in button downs and kaikis, I had a jacket on.  The waiter wasn't that busy he just wasn't around. The food was excellent, but the menu was limited and the main courses mundane, (Salmon is at Denny's) I had two appitiesers as a main course, pork belly and rissoto and both were excellent. We all had dessert as the portions were so small. The pistachio panna cotta was over the top. The crowning glosry of the evening was the check ($400 for 4, one cocktail and one glass of wine). The check arrived. I put my card in the folder for payment. Nothing happened no one came. Finally in desparation I had to hold the check ou and wave it to a group of waiters/stafff that were having a grand old time playing catch up over by the open grill. No wonder I was able to get a reservation for that evening at 5 in the afternoon. What a total waste of overpriced good food with lousy service."

There was once specific nutty spicy sauce that was so good with the naan. We ordered the risotto for an app and for $20 bucks it wasn't worth it. It was good, but not worth $20 especially for the portion size (even though we didn't finish it). My fiance ordered the Halibut which was really great and I ordered the sea bass, which was just as good. \n\nService was great. The weird thing was that two tables were seated around us and both of them up and left. They were replaced with other people, but maybe the price scared them off and how little choices there are on the menu?

            "review": "Sensi is a TRUE treat. My family and I have now had three consecutive, flawless experiences at Sensi and this establishment has now worked its way into my top 5 favorite dinner options in Sin City. \n\nFirst of all, the setup of the restaurant is beautifully executed-- four different specialty kitchens (all open and just covered by glass) work together to create quite the memorable experience. On this last trip, we were right in front of the naan station. OH, THE NAAN. Standby for further gushing. (On a side note, I'm always a tad amused at the comparison of the kitchens to a zoo-- patrons at Sensi can just walk around the entire enclosure and watch the chefs at work. A very neat, transparent way to dine!)\nThe decor of the restaurant conveys a semi-upscale and classy ambiance without any stuffiness or pretentious vibes. Their drinks and desserts are all on display via iPad (nice technological touch). Our water glasses were always full and napkins were refolded upon every restroom break or chef-watching walk. \n\nNow, the food is really what continues to amaze me here. The table first starts off with a basket of naan (an Indian bread). I am the biggest sucker for naan, and this IS the best I have ever had. This last time, we were given three baskets, and I am pretty sure that I ate probably 80% of each basket...whoops. I was so full once my dish came out but I kept powering through. \nI repeat: THE BEST NAAN EVER. Sometimes, I think that Sensi is worth the visit for this alone. \n\nThe menu is split into four different categories/cuisines, so there is a lot to offer to even the pickiest diner. Some of our favorite dishes:\n \nAppetizers:\n\n+TLC Roll: Tempura Lobster and Crab sushi roll. There are only four total pieces, but they are excellent. Served with dabs of avocado whipped cream of sorts and some bite-y aioli. \n+Coconut and Shrimp Soup: If I could eat this soup every day for the rest of my life, and nothing else, I would live happily. A downright delicious coconut broth, slammed with different shoots of mushrooms, large shrimp, and a few tapioca balls (like those in Boba tea). Then, this smorgasbord is put into a fresh young coconut. MMMMM\nNOTE: (-)Crispy shrimp: We tried this app, but these were actually a disappointment. Way too crunchy and the only dish we haven't liked here. \n\nMain:\n\n+Sensi Noodles: The Sensi Noodles are amazing and is a fitting Asian dish to complement any other non-Asian dishes you may order. Served lo mein style with several prawns and a perfect balance of flavors with the noodles. \n+Butternut Squash Ravioli: Talk about a tasting overload! I cannot recall having a dish where so many flavors have been incorporated so effectively yet not taking away from the dish; I have a tough time explaining the dish as there were so many different elements and components making up everything besides the raviolis. Mushrooms, a few purple potatoes, spaghetti squash, etc... all basking in the perfect amount of flavorful cream sauce...I don't know what else I can say to do this dish justice! \n+My dad got the rib-eye on our last experience and woooow, I did not expect this piece of meat to be THIS good. I'm typically not a big fan of rib-eye cuts due to the high fat content, but this one was just right. My dad's only advice was to get half of the normal amount of seasoning on the steak..he said it was a little too salty for him. Otherwise, this had the tenderness of a filet and was packed with flavor! Also, the kitchen cooked it to perfection (medium-rare-plus). \n\nDessert: \n+Sensi Ice Bubble: A legitimate ice sculpture bigger than my head, hollowed out and filled with three scoops of sorbet or gelato-- wonderful presentation and even more wonderful taste! I love the mango sorbet and pistachio gelato. \n+Coffee and Donuts: Six sugar-dusted beignet donuts served with a Bailey's frozen cappuccino of sorts. A nice cap on dinner! \n \nWe have had a waiter by the name of Laurence every time, and he is simply fantastic. He is a very vocal Englishman, but is exceedingly knowledgeable of the menu and one can easily see that he truly loves what he does each and every day. Request him for some high energy at your table! \n\nOverall, Sensi is a place I will continue to visit each time I'm in Vegas. Give them a shot, I bet you won't leave disappointed!"

The view of the kitchens accompanied by flowing water everywhere, the design is truly lovely.\n\nAnyway, we ordered fried shrimp with citrus, market mixed green salad, butter chicken, skirtsteak with green papaya salad.\n\nBut first, let's start out with bread service. Bread service consists of papadums and handmade naan out of a two real clay ovens installed in the kitchens. Although it didn't have quite the same elasticity and crispiness of the best naan I've ever had, it was still pretty darn good. Adding the tomato chutney, I just wanted to take the lovely East Indian naan-making gentleman home with me. (He's really nice - when we made hand signals of how much we like his naan - he sent out another fresh basket for us!)\n\nThe fried shrimp was satisfyingly crisp and well seasoned. The market salad was equally pleasurable with the hint of bitterness of the lettuces and acidity from the citrus. Very well balanced dishes.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the grilled marinated skirtsteak (right amount of char) and nicely spiced accompanying green papaya salad. The green papaya was shaved so delicately, it looked like glass noodles. Wonderful flavour and textures. The butter chicken was nice along with the rice but it wasn't extraordinary.\n\nDessert was okay but not exceptional. The chocolate temptation dessert was overly sweet while the caramel ice cream had a very heavy burnt sugar flavouring to it. The tapioca pudding was rather flavourless when paired with that wonderful mango lassi and coconut ice cream.\n\nValue wise, you can likely find each individual components for less else where (I'm sure you can get a decent butter chicken or green papaya salad for less than $50/person). However the service is wonderful and the ambience is amazing.\n\nI would say normally, this place would deserve a 3.5 star. However in light of the exceptional bread service, I'm bumping it up to a 4 star review."

            "review": "Not sure if I'd really call this \"Asian fusion.\"  It's more like various Asian and Asian-type dishes served alongside straight-up European fare.  Not that there's anything wrong with that--I love being able to eat Thai coconut soup, naan, and various Italian foods at the same meal.\n\nThe ambiance is great.  Lots of glass, lots of really cool-looking stone (including our massive 7-person table, which was nestled in an alcove which jutted into the large glass-walled kitchen).  Great view of an awkward-looking rendezvous in which a man seemed to be trying really hard to impress his much-younger-looking date.  I know that if I wanted to do that in Vegas, Sensi would be one of my top choices.\n\nThe food was interesting.  The bread was naan, which came with chutney, tzatziki sauce, and some other stuff I don't remember because it was 2 months ago. Unfortunately, the waiters never bothered explaining that to us--we had to play detective and figure that stuff out ourselves.  In terms of stuff that we actually paid for, most of the stuff I tasted (duck/foie gras potstickers, tataki roll, Thai coconut soup, and short ribz) was outstanding.  In particular, the soup came in a real coconut, which you could scrape off the sides and mix into the broth.  Awesome!  I also tasted the branzino, which one of my friends ordered.  That wasn't as good, probably because it had gotten soggy after soaking in clam broth for 20 minutes before I was able to grab a bite.  That probably wasn't Sensi's fault.\n\nOverall, the food was great, the whole concept of the place was great, but the service left a bit to be desired.  Considering how much we paid for everything, the staff seemed rather disinterested and unenthusiastic.  I'd probably give Sensi 3.5 stars if I could."

Sensi offered that as they are a fusion of Japanese and Italian food. The restaurant is beautiful, modern, and styled so that all its guests have a view of the kitchen. The kitchen is pretty much a glass box. We ordered two rolls, the chicken with risotto, glazed salmon and a size of mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious! Our favorite roll was the tuna something... I forgot the name, but definitely try the roll with the tuna. The chicken was juicy, but the risotto was kinda weird... The salmon was yummy as was the mashed potatoes. We also got dessert - the trio of gelato in the ice bubble. We got salted caramel, thai tea, and vanilla espresso. As a departing gift, our waiter gave us truffles! Great food and great service! Would come back again :)"

            "review": "Sensi:  Italian for \"the senses\" (or so I hear).  And boy does Sensi not disappoint.  \n\nSight:  Impeccable.  The restaurant is laid out in four different kitchens, plus a dessert kitchen and a bread bakery.  The decor is sleek and contemporary, with natural materials:  light colored woods, large pieces of hewn stone, sometimes rough and natural, sometimes polished smooth, with brushed metal accents and flowing water.  There were many different dining rooms as well, with 6 or so tables in each, so it feels intimate no matter where you are.  The staff is well-dressed and groomed, with clean, simple uniforms.  The plates were all unique, and \n\nTouch:  The seats were comfortable and the table was smooth and nice to touch, while the appetizer plates had an interesting texture.  The cool soft water of the vanishing edge fountains was nice, and was clearly either distilled or at least purified with salt (otherwise I suppose the fountains would get silty).  Along with the glass and the polished stone, very nice texture-wise.  (Though no one goes to restaurants to feel on things.  Oh well.)\n\nSmell:  Tantalizing.  The first brush is the Indian tandoori, with hints of curry.  The smell of the fresh bread was exquisite as well, and being seated next to the bread bakery was a plus in that department.  The light salt scent of fresh seafood was there, as well as garlicy and buttery hints, though I'm not sure from where, exactly.\n\nSound:  I can't say that it was the most amazing place with sound.  You hear the typical restaurant sounds of plates and the shuffling feet of wait-staff.  There was either no music, or it was too light to be heard, though the sound of running water was nice.  We talked throughout, as well, so I suppose that that wasn't too big a deal.  It was *not* loud and echo-y, though, as you might expect from the stone and glass used.  I'm guessing the wood in the ceiling and floor helped to damp it, but I'm not sure.\n\nTaste:  I'm sorry while I tear up a little.  The food was very good.  Very good indeed.  We started with cocktails (didn't feel like wine that night, and I wasn't sure what I was ordering yet), but it was the perfect mix of citrus and rum, and I really enjoyed it.   We were given slices of at least 3 or 4 kinds of bread, freshly baked and sliced right behind us, with butter and a chive spread.  It was great.  Next, we ordered Tuna 3-ways, and the Thai Lobster and Shrimp rolls, and they were very good.  The fish was fresh, and had a unique flavor that one could dream about.  The rolls were good as well, but I think a little more cilantro could've helped it along to perfection.  We had a bit of everything.  Lamb, Scallops, Steak, and Lobster (the four of us with one each), and usually you don't share at a fine dining restaurant, but the food was too good not to sample some of everyone's plate. The lamb was in a light and flakey pastry with just the right done-ness, the scallops had the most rich and subtle lightly buttered taste, the lobster was served Indian style, and the steak was rich and full, and the largest thing served there.  I had the tapioca pudding for dessert, and it really is THE BEST as they advertise, the creme brulee was to die for, especially the unique pistachio, and I can't recall was it was called, but the chocolate log was great, and I'm not usually much for chocolate.  Nothing I didn't like at all from Sensi.  When we left, we were given a small box of cookies, a nice touch, and each was very good.\n\nService (the Sixth Sense):  We were seated almost immediately for our reservation.  The hostess was gracious, addressed the party by name, and slowly walked us through the restaurant to our seat.  The table setting had everything, each person having a bread plate, a water glass, a wine glass, two forks, and a knife.   The wine menu is expansive and much larger than the food menu, with all ranges of pricing (none cheap, though).  The hostess let us sit down, and the three adults put their napkins in their laps, and the hostess put the napkin in the child's lap herself.  \nThe waiter came by, introduced himself, and offered us choice of water, and promptly took the wine glass from the minor's place setting.  Since we'd informed him of a birthday in the party, that person was served first, and then the waiter would move completely across the table to the lady second (it was clear she'd be first if it wasn't for the birthday celebrant).  All the little touches were there, with the glasses removed or refilled as needed, and when two in the party got up to go to the restroom, leaving their napkins on the chairs, the napkins were quickly removed, and new, folded napkins were left near the place setting.  The steak was not finished during the meal, so it was boxed up in a container, and placed in a stylish carrying back with Sensi on the front.  The wait staff took care of every need, but tended to stay out of your way.  Just how I like it.\n\nSensi deserves every star.  Recommended."

I'm normally NOT picky or particularly bitchy when it comes to service however at a 5 star restaurant at a 5 star hotel I expected much more.\n\nWe were finally seated (after seating 5 other parties before us) in the very very very back.  Not a problem however there were a ton of empty tables. My boyfriend even made a comment about how shitty the service was for how empty the restaurant was.\n\nThe cocktail menu came on an iPad which I thought was cool and cheesy at the same time.  I had the black crush.  For food we ordered:\n\nYellowtail sashimi appetizer - SO GOOD with the citrus\nMiso glazed Salmon - SO TENDER and SO YUM.\nNiman ranch Porkchop - also really good and perfectly cooked\n\nDessert was pistachio panna cotta...which was definitely different.  It wasn't particularly bad but also wasn't that memorable.  The presentation surpassed the flavor.\n\nSidenote: the tomato chutney with the naan is TO DIE FOR. I could have eaten it all night long!\n\nOverall, the food was good but was it worth the price? No. Will I recommend it to friends? Perhaps. But I probably will try something else in Vegas."

I'm an aspiring chef, well I like to watch Food Network, and being able to watch the chefs in the glassed-in kitchen prepare the meal was like being a kid in a candy store.\n\nWe arrived shortly after the beginning of dinner service and the place was pretty empty. By the time we left 90 minutes later, most tables were occupied and there was a large group (conference or something) in what I assume was a banquet room in the back. They were a little noisy but it wasn't too bad.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the TLC (tempura lobster crab) roll and the Crispy Fried Shrimp, both of which were amazing. The shrimp were a bit too sweet for my taste, but the wife gobbled them up. The TLC roll was very delicious, and an interesting twist on a sushi roll. It's a spendy treat, however, since after tax/tip you're looking at about 28 bucks a plate, containing 4 bite-sized appetizers. Those good with math will spot the 7-dollars-a-bite price. Totally worth it though!\n\nThe bread service was naan with four sauces... yogurt, curry, soy, and sweet chili. Pretty good naan, but part of that might just be that we hadn't had the delightful substance for quite a while. Not bad for free food..\n\nFor entree, we had the butter curry chicken and the mushroom ravioli, both of which were great. The ravioli was served with stewed oxtail, and was tasty. Wife liked the curry, too.\n\nDefinitely recommend Sensi... We escaped for $125 plus tip: two appetizers, two half-glasses of wine, two (lower-priced) entrees. Go there for yourself!"

I make the call and leave a message. I get an e-mail in response stating that our schedules jut don't jive (I'm about to drop a few thousand dollars on your place and you can't make time to call me?) AND that the restaurant closes EVERY JUNE for 10 days of \"repairs and renovations\". \n\nIn the 2 months that we were talking no one thought to mention that?! Okay, fine, the email said they didn't have the dates yet so I can maybe see how they wouldn't want to frighten me off unnecessarily, but I'd still would  have liked some warning. \n\nThe final straw was when the events coordinator never got back to me to tell me the exact dates they'd be closed this June (the 6th through 16th if you're curious) like she said she would.

We were sad we couldn't finish them as our entrees were delicious too.\n\nI ordered the Signature Braised Short Rib. The meal was beautifully presented (see my picture) and the meat fell apart so nicely. Co-worker had the Butternut Squash Ravioli which she loved as well.\n\nThe meal was definitely pricey but worth it if you want a nice dinner in a nice hotel and want a place with LOTS to choose from on the menu. There is definitely something for everyone!"
