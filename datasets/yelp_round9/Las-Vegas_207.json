            "review": "You would think this would be the perfect place to cure a hang over right? ...We were wrong... there was 10 of us and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for them to clear 2 tables for us. Once we were seated, we looked at the menu only to find the prices were pretty freakin nuts for the type of food this place offers. (ie. $20 for pho, $18 for pad thai, $18 for wonton noodle, $26 for wonton, scallop, pork, vegetable soup, $10 eggrolls, $4 for thai ice tea, etc **these aren't the exact prices but its around this price**).\n\nAfter ordering our food, we had to wait about 15 minutes just to get our drinks. Had to wait another 45 minutes to get our food. I guess they wanted to serve us all at once so half of the food that came out was already cold or room temperature. Onto the food.... ABSOLUTELY the worst chinese/vietnamese/thai food we've ever had. Everything lacked flavor, meats and seafood was chewy, soup tasted water down, portions were kind of small for what you pay for, etc. I work and eat in downtown Oakland China Town all the time, and The Noodle Shop doesn't even compare to anything there.... Pho or wonton noodle soup is my hang over food, and this place just wanted to make me throw everything up.\n\nThis place was highly understaffed, and the cooks were slow.... My friends and I have already made complaints, so in the mean time...STAY CLEAR AWAY!!! You're better off walking 5 minutes away to McDonalds!"

            "review": "Had a quick meal here as it was 2pm and all we had to eat so far that day was Fat Tuesday's frozen daiquiris (yes, with the extra shot). I wasn't about to repeat my L'Atlier experience from last year. I needed something in my stomach before dining at Sage, stat! My friend ordered the beef satay and I got the Hong Kong won ton noodle soup. I've had better, but for under $12 it hit the spot. The broth lacked any of the subtle nuances that you can get with ramen broth, but the won tons had generous amounts of shrimp (and not much else). My friend thought her beef satay was way too sweet. Service was well, true to what I call \"Asian restaurant service\"--they bring you your food and leave you alone. I rarely tip 15% nowadays but here is where it may be justified. The reason why this place exists is because Vegas attracts a lot of Asian gamblers and if they're like my parents, they would prefer to eat Asian food. Heed my advice and do not eat here if given the choice. A better meal awaits you somewhere else."

Fried rice.\nAll we good  also my son had the wor won ton soup.  As with every one else I think it was pricey for the type of food.  What I don't understand is \nif the food is blah why is it so dang busy.  The 1st time we ate there we were greeted and seated within minutes.  The 2nd time we ate there yes we ate there twice. The was a wait for about 15 minutes or so before we got in.  The waiter were ok although they do tend to forget about once they serve your food.  Over all experience 2 stars If I only knew there was a Panda express across the street you'll be better off eating there."

The Mongolian beef was drenched in sauce, and the calamari came out after we finished our dinner entree. This place is horrible, SAVE YOURSELF THE TRIP AND DONT GO. Order some room service instead.

Certainly there are better places for that like in Venetian or Bellagio.  And no soups can beat the one in the Monte Carlo.  But to their defense, this is not their specialty.  They serve Chinese food.  Not the greatest in the world, but not bad either.  I like coming here since I rarely have to wait and can get your standard Chinese dishes at a reasonable price."

They are serving hotel guests, gamblers or show attendees.

Some of our soups came out lukewarm.\n\nThe price of the food here too is completely ridiculous.  I understand that everything is a little overpriced in Vegas but COME ON! You are charging almost $20 dollars for poor quality pho?  You are better off gambling $10 dollars on slots and getting a burger and fries at McDonald's. At least then you would be decently full, maybe make some money, and still have your faculties about you to enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nThe one shining star was that the wait staff was super friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, this was not enough to overlook the poor quality and overpriced food here."

Service was fine, though the restaurant was not crowded and the lady with the mop should have waited till we left before mopping all around our table. I would go here again next time."

She then came back with our food and that was the last we saw of her. She didn't ask us how anything was or if our drinks needed refills. I then went to go pay for the bill and was just wanting to get out by that time. The lady at the cashier desk asked us how it was and after explaining our experience, she just said that she would speak to her after her shift. No apologies and nothing offered to help.

It's definitely not your authentic Asian spot and definitely catered to tourist who think Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food."

I'm thinking there has to be some Chinese chefs back here in Vegas! Hell they changed the whole facade of the Lion's mouth entrance for the MGM Grand since many Chinese would not go there!!  (bad luck) Ok remember where you are..... listen to the staff. They are almost all from China or Hong Kong Cantonese speaking!  the place is called Noodles ! it will be overpriced and not as good as Monterey park or your last visit to a Hong Kong street corner. Do not order the Pho, the Thai food, and for that matter ....the Japanese udon! These are all different Asian countries ! Thats like going to a place called  \" EuroBeef \" ... having the same guy making Brats, Beef Wellington, and  Beef Bourguignon... Have what these guys make all the time... Chinese noodle soup and the congee.... again overpriced, but that seems to be the theme in this hotel!  I had the seafood won ton noodle soup.... with chilean seabass? Yes it was really seabass (i was skeptical at first) .... seems like a waste in the soup . Really it was not bad and was as tender and buttery as any Chilean seabass. I have been reading reviews about the service.....well i am not defending by any means, but have they been to Chinatown / Monterey Park at all??!!  I know it looks like PF Changs.... \n  Anyway my girlfriend had the Pho..... I warned her. It came with  Italian Basil like the kind you use on Caprese, and not the Thai/Asian  (her review will be 1 star! lol) The congee did look good too..."

It is a perfect casual noodle/Asian cuisine restaurant.  Which is great for a casual experience when you tend to eat such heavy, large meals in Vegas.\n\nAmazing Har Gow with a bit of expected wait. The chow fun was delicious... Even when I ordered it without onions or bean sprouts. The pad thai was a tad oily so we asked for light oil the 2 time and enjoyed it. Great hot tea. \n\nThe service was a little sub pair ESP for Vegas. The food out-weighed my opinion of this place."

Located just off the casino floor in the Mandalay Bay resort, it is designed in a simple, and modern style.\n\nThe menu is a mix of Chinese, Thai and other dishes. However, if you are looking for true Thai dishes, this is not going to meet your desires. Lots of rice and noodle dishes, which are great to cure a case of the beer (or wine, or bourbon) flu.  Since I was suffering from a strain of the Guinness-Jameson blight, I chose a hot Green Tea and the Roast Duck noodle soup. This was the perfect cure. The duck was excellent, perfectly cooked, perfectly done meat, with a little bit of fatty skin.  The broth complimented the duck perfectly.  It also had some noodles and a little veg, though I wish there were a little more of the greens added.  My wife  had the Tom Yum Thai soup. Good but not really Thai style, missing elements like the lime and the sour style that is common.  When suffering from the 'flu' it is best to have a spicy dish. The hot bean paste condiment is excellent. Nice roasted and smoky flavor. It does pack a wallop.\n\nThe price was right and the service was quick and efficient, and friendly. The General Manager stopped by, asked about our meal and when asked, he gave us a little education on the pending Chinese New Year.  A very nice touch."

They gave us the kids menu which had coloring on it, but they only gave us one menu and  no crayons. \n Some of the menu items are just outrageously priced. \n Who pays 16.50 for fried rice and a lot of their single dishes like fish or beef were upwards of 24 dollars and up? \n  My kids did like the soup.

The service is not very good. 20 min wait with tons of empty table. \n\nOkay. It is a holiday. I am not going to complain. But after we sat down, it took so long for someone to serve us. That is ridiculous. \n\nThe food, is well kind of bad. It is eatable. But doesn't taste good at all. If you have a car, it is really better to go out and eat. \n\nFinally, the price... Too expensive !!!! It costs us over $30 per person. If you are not hungry for asian food, you may find a better place to eat in this hotel."

It is extremely bland and the noodle texture is stiff and not chewy. The pho costs double the price compared to back home, it takes 5 times longer to come out, yet it tastes like warm water with noddles. We also ordered orange chicken, mongolian beef, and garlic lobster. All the items were good but way to overpriced for simple dishes. There are so many delicious restaurants at the Mandalay Bay, steer clear of Noodle House"

You can always tell when a place is good when it's busy with patrons and it was, especially full of Asian customers! ;) This time I came in with the intention of ordering the crispy duck noodle soup which was delish! I forgot to request flat rice noodles instead of egg noodles but it was great anyway as the duck was meaty and perfectly cooked. The soup was more than enough especially for lunch. We had a lady named lua (I think) service our table, she was very friendly and attentive, she was quite endearingly cute! A little pricy but the restaurant was clean and didn't look cheap at all, nicely decorated with plants, mirrors, artworks and soft colours used. The toilets are clean and spacious! Free wifi available too. Always a place to visit when I'm in town!!"

Figured that the authentic service would be a good sign, but alas I was in for a disappointment.\n\nThe food was average chinese food that I could get in Delaware, which if you have read my posts before that is a very low bar.  I ended up getting the chicken lettuce cups as an appetizer and the Hong Kong style noodles with seafood.\n\nThe chicken filling was well made with a nice mild sweetness it.  The water chestnuts were chopped and crisp.  As a difference there was some pine nuts mixed in which was a nice crunch and flavor.  Chicken was moderate, but nothing special.  Disappointingly the dish came with only 3 leaves of lettuce for the dish, much too few.  The other problem was that they served it with ROMAINE lettuce, not much of a cup or able to wrap it up.  Poor choice of lettuce type.\n\nHong Kong style noodles were not freshly made, they were standard type thick noodles.  Not exactly pasty but pretty close.  The fish in the seafood was cold and flat tasting with a bit of gristle.  The shrimp was well seasoned and prepared but that was the only highlight of the dish.  Overall the dish was a bit oily and disappointing.\n\nWhile I understand that the food would be a bit more expensive because of the location in the casino it was way overpriced considering the quality of the food.  The dishes were of low quality compared to what I would expect at Vegas in a casino.  I avoided this place during the remainder of my trip and would not return."

They're just shrimp and they added the title \"prawns\" to them so they can charge you $26 for 9 shrimps bedded with salad.  It's pretty expensive here so you're better off getting comp from the casino to eat.  That's what we did the second time and it was okay.  \nThe food is \"not\" bad nor is it spectacular.  The best plate there is probably the Shrimp/Pork Dumpling for Appetizer.  It's only 6 bucks and I would order 3 of those with a few drinks and call it.  If you want tea then they'll charge you $2.50 for a cup.  This is the only place I have ever been to that charges you tea.  LOL.  This place is still surviving because it's the only Asian Restaurant you'll find that caters to Asian people in Mandalay Bay.  I can't hate it...  I just hate the prices!"

I came pretty late (like thirty minutes before closing..which I think was midnight), so I was seated very quickly.\n  \n  The atmosphere of the place is pretty cozy and chic, but without having that uber \"hey look we're a fusion restaurant\" look. The menu had a good amount of items that seemed pretty authentic. Anyway I ordered some Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, beef chow fun, and a roasted duck noodle soup. \n\n  Service throughout the night was very quick and friendly (even though the place was pretty much closing) and the servers constantly came by to check on me...which was nice. The food on the other hand...well I don't know what it was...but nothing was that hot...in temperature. As if everything was cooked, but sat out for five or ten minutes before they served it to me.  As for the quality, it was somewhere between what you'd get at a Chinese buffet and actually going to a restaurant in a decent Chinatown. As for prices...well it's Vegas so it's definitely higher than what you'd expect from a Chinatown place (i.e. Beef Chow Fun was like $15...where as in Chinatown would be closer to $8-10). But not going to make you go broke by any means.  I think my only major beef with the place was that my hot tea was luke warm...kind of annoying.\n\n  Anyway The Noodle Shop is definitely not a place I would go out of my way for. But the food quality was good enough, the prices were fair, and the service was very good. If I was craving Chinese food and in the Mandalay Bay or near it...I wouldn't hesitate to stop in. \n\n~G"

Noodles were perfect, exactly how I wanted it to be and not over cooked. The Chili on the side is nice and compliments the dishes. \n\nFried rice 9.5/10- I'm not a fan of soft, gooey, sticky fried rice.

Our experience was certainly better than a lot of other people here and we are used to VERY GOOD Asian food in Chicagoland.\n\nVery nice tastefully minimalist decorated with very tall white private booths, white tablecloth etc. You pretty much completely disappear once you are seated, and would have to stand and turn around to see any other guests. Great Escape frankly from the marble hallway endless music din from a nameless cover band and casino pinging in the distance; also a good place for that \"it's not you it's me\" conversation initiating  some good makeup or goodbye sex and a fight over the cat and dog.\n\nI'll be honest, it was late enough and we had enough of a buzz going from whatever show we had been to that we do NOT remember exactly what we had, but it was Good AND we had leftovers and ate them too. I think we had Singapore noodles and a duck entre, I know it wasn't tofu, seafood or chicken. Spices were low, I know I asked for medium on something and got low. Anyway, of course their site isn't going to spit a menu up but here for some reason, but here is how to eat here if you are in the Mandalay Bay Complex hungry and it is after 10pm. \nTell your server any food limitations and preference and ASK what they recommend and go with it if it sounds good because I KNOW that is what we did and it was late enuf that I am pretty sure the chef served our meal, not a waitress. They also had some ok LARGE by the glass wines. And use some common sense, The Noodle House passed my yummy smell test when we came in, but we weren't ordering the weekend seafood special on a Tuesday night at 10:30pm. If it doesn't feel right, get up and walk out, trust your intuition; I do it all the time and never regret it. \nBon Appetit."

The broth was hot and flavorful, and it helped soothed my throat which has grown weary from inhaling the smoke filled air of the casinos. The long thin noodles were a lot of fun to eat and were very tasty.  The wontons were good, but I don't think they were as good as other wontons I've had.  They offered generous portions which left me comfortably full.  However, the downside is the price-- $13 is a lot for a bowl of wonton soup!

To start off, everything is overpriced, but that is fairly typical on the strip. The fried rice was very bland. The beef chow fun was too salty. Nothing seemed to be going right.\n\nThen, it got worse. We were told the dim sum sample platter for 2 would take 15 min to arrive. It took way longer. It consisted of 8 pieces shumai/ dumplings and 2 pork buns. For $30, I was expecting a bit more. To top it all, everything was disgusting. The dumplings were rubbery and everything else look liked it had been dyed with food coloring. After eating 2 pieces, we couldn't take it anymore and stopped. \n\nI've never had such a bad asian dining experience before.

You know that ominous feeling like you're just another digit versus maybe a repeat paying customer? Yes that feeling, like asking to get more menus for all of the people in the party? Isn't that restaurant 101 or were they that short on counting fingers to figure it out! The menu: typical choices you would find at all fast food \"Chinese\" take out. Flavor: tasted like the typical \"Chinese\" food from any average casino buffet. I say that because we were staying at Mandalay Bay and went to Bayside Buffet and the \"Chinese\" items were that much better! We had a fairly big party of 14 people, but there was maybe another 3 little parties in the restaurant the whole time we were there. 6 o'clock Saturday on Easter weekend. This place was empty, the service was lacking, you had to ask for everything (refill, napkins, etc). With a handful of workers just standing on the side wall coming from the kitchen, they should've been more attentive to a big party. The only item that was half decent was the Beef/Broccoli only because it was the only entree that came out like it was made to order and was somewhat hot. Everyone's meals were room temperature or looked undercooked. Everything was BLAND! Makes you wonder who cooks and manages this place in a nice Hotel like this. The second star is because the place was clean, other than that all negative reviews are true about this place. I for one would never recommend it no matter the convenience because you'll be paying the average price of $16-19 an entree, where your average good Chinese restaurant you would pay about half across the board.

Anyway, I finally had a chance eat at the Noodle Shop and we weren't disappointed.\n\nMy daughter Muff, sister Luch and I were exhausted and broke after spending the day at the Fashion Show Mall.  We barely dragged ourselves back to the hotel and decided to eat before we went to our rooms. (We said that if we could make it to our rooms, we were NOT leaving.  And the previously checked out room service menu didn't strike our fancies.)\nWe perused the menu and here's what we ordered:\n*  Shumai, \n*  Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork\n*  Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce;\n*  BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables\n\nOnly four dishes with rice and enough to feed a family of moose!  Everything was delicately flavored and wonderful.  I love garlic, but it can easily overpower any other flavor in its path.  It was present and accounted for in my Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce but not overly so.  My sister's Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork was also delicious.  And my daughter Muff's BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables was simple yet enchanting.  And the freshly made Shumai was delightful.\nWe had a scrumptious lovely meal to end our day of shopping madness."

All the limes in the world wouldn't have helped this flavorless dish. Very pricey for quality and value. Be sure you don't expect to try dessert-the check was presented with no question of any dessert or drinks-and when we queried the waitress-we were told they don't have dessert?

After checking in my boy's and I needed a quick fix and wanted something quick and cheap, which we could not find at the hotel. So we ended up at the noodle shop. \n\nLong story short, the food was okay and we paid  around $11 for effing soup that was just blah. We were still hungry and ordered the combination fried rice which was $12 blah, but for $12 I was expecting a mountain full of rice. Instead we got a speed bump of rice. \n\nOverall this place was an overall bust, that placed $25 in my pocket. If you can't find anything to eat at the Mandalay that's quick and cheap I recommend walking a little further to the Luxor or go to the Cafe."

He kept saying how great this place was and plus every restaurant there was pack expect this place. I wounded why... So I by pass looking at the tips and reviews that everyone wrote so I can give this place a fair chance.\n\nSo soon as we put our name on the list we waited only for about 5 mins. Okay, that is cool place didn't seem so bad. Right? Place look clean, got seat away from everyone else so it was a nice family style of five. Then this is when the stars kept on falling here... We waited for ten mins for the server to get us water and our orders to be put in. We had to flag some manger to get someone to attend to us. \n\nNow comes the good part dinner. We order fried calamari, pancake, and BBQ pork. Out of the three the BBQ pork was the best. The pancake was too powdery too me. And the calamari it was all batter! Horrible. As for our main course the duck soup with noodles was bland. Shrimp fried rice was okay but lucky for me they had sriracha  the house special noodles was okay but again sriracha is needed again.\n\nTo sum it all up, come here for BBQ pork. If you really have too. I mean if you have no where else to go and your super hungry. Other than that if you still have the power to wait else where to eat then go somewhere else. This was not worth the money or time to try."

A few Thai Iced Teas later we were looking at close to $50 for two people eating soup for lunch. I understand the rules of traveling, especially when you go to Las Vegas. You'll normally spend $10 for every mixed drink and $8 for every beer. That's just how it works and it's fine if you get good food and great service, but that's not what we got.\n\nI'm not sure if it was how we looked or dressed but our server \"Wendy\" was rushing us the entire time. She kept checking to see if we were done with our soup and kept peaking from behind the exit to see how much longer we'd be eating. Another server came by and tried to take our bowls when we weren't even done. They didn't even leave us an option for desert as Wendy rushed the bill to our table. For mediocre-good food, this place had poor service. I couldn't understand why they wanted us out so quickly, it's not like this place was busy at 2:51pm on a weekday afternoon. \n\nIn Summary: The food was good, the tea was fine, the prices were inflated and the service was awful. Instead, go to the Chin-Chin restaurant at New York New York Hotel & Casino for amazing Asian food and top notch service with reasonable prices."

You may be wondering why an experienced yelper like myself would be checking reviews AFTER they are already eating somewhere. First, every other restaurant had a long wait. I was REALLY hungry, hubby wasn't feeling well and just wanted to get me fed so we could head up to the room. The empty restaurant should have been a sign, but I went for it because how much can you screw up noodles? Reception is always tough in casinos, so I didn't even try to check reviews. \n\nI ordered Pad Thai, my husband ordered wonton soup. I'm not sure I even can even use words to describe how seriously awful the Pad Thai was. If I was blind folded I don't know that I would even know it was Pad Thai. My guess would be that it was leftover noodles from a chafing dish at a 10 year reunion the night before. The flavor was awful, the texture bizarre, as hungry as I was I could not even make myself choke this down. My husband's soup was almost edible if you avoided the wonton. So basically the broth was bland enough to force it down your throat in a pinch.\n\nI so very rarely send food back, but this was inedible and expensive to boot! I kept trying to flag a server down, finally after 10+ minutes I went up to the hostess and said I needed either a manager or my server. When the server came over I started to explain why I didn't like it. He didn't seem surprised at all, just took it away and asked if I wanted something else. I decided not to subject myself to anything else from this place. We paid for the soup and then headed over to a small souvenir shop in the hotel. We grabbed a bag of pretzels and called it a night. Those Rold Gold pretzels were AMAZING after the slop we'd had here.\n\nI don't think there is anything you could do to get me to eat here again. Even if it was free! Even if I was hungry and given the option of this or nothing, I think I would choose nothing every time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! Mandalay Bay should close this place down and open a good noodle place. Noodles are awesome when you have had a little too much Vegas fun, and even if the noodles were just average I think it would do very well! If you saw a picture of how tired this place looks, you would not even think this would be open inside Mandalay Bay. This place needs to go!"

Eggplant is pretty good. Its all good. Its all very very expensive."

We spent the remainder of our evening on the toilet back at the hotel room.\n\nThe only positives were that the server was attentive (because there were only like 7 customers at 6pm) and the Chicken Satay appetizer (which appeared to be cooked properly) was actually pretty good.\n\nDon't go here.

It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.\n\nThe Thai curry chicken was a generous portion. The chicken was a strange texture (boiled, maybe?) but tasted ok.

I should note here, that while I believe that there are several sake options, none other than cold/hot were offered to me, and there was no drink menu.\n\nThe dish was like a package of store-bought ramen noodles with just a hint  of curry flavor, but TONS of salt. It also had a few shrimp and some duck bits in it, which was fine for me - but was not mentioned on the menu. Vegetarians beware. \n\nSadly, with such a salty dish, I never got a refill on my water, nor on my sake - as a matter of fact, the waiter never visited my table again until he brought the check. He never asked if I wanted anything else - desert, maybe - and I had to beg for another glass of water.\n\nHe then hovered over me while I figured out the bill (almost $40 for ramen and a glass of cheap sake).\n\nHorrible, horrible, horrible.\n...AND, I might add, Horrible.\n\nDon't do it."

That being said, the food was good but not great.  The main issue is the food was never hot.  I did go twice but only because I really wanted to try the Seafood Pan fried Noodles. I wasnt thrilled with it.  \n\nThe first day, I had the lunch special of chicken, shrimp and beef with garlic sauce and 2 mini spring rolls (the app should have been served earlier than the main and it was not, so tell them if you want it that way).  That dish was excellent and had it been hot, it would have been stellar.  It came with white rice.  The lunch special is 18.99 and they have about 8 choices of specials; my dish was enough for 2.  Service was slow the first day and quick the second day. My water was refilled constantly and the waiters were very nice as was the Maitre D.  It is a casual restaurant located right off the casino so there is some people watching to be done if you get a table closer to the front.  \n\nI would recommend the restaurant for the chicken, beef, and shrimp dish but not for the pan fried noodles. I also would be specific and ask for very hot food and apps served first. None of these requests should be needed but if done, this review would have been markedly higher."

When he arrived, we wanted his suggestions for the best noodles. He recommended a XO Vietnamese noodle with shrimp, the most expensive noodle. My husband warned me that the waiter was just trying to up sell the pricey dish. Regardless, it didn't sound too appealing to me, when our waiter returned, I went with the Singapore curry noodle. I wanted to get tofu instead of shrimp, but our waiter said it would be $2 extra! Sorry, but that is unacceptable. If I am not getting shrimp, there should not be an upcharge for tofu. So, I went with shrimp even though I wasn't planning on eating them. \n\nMy husband ordered the $26 Vietnamese noodle with shrimp. That's right. He ordered the thing he had warned me against. Crazy husband.\n\nMy curry noodles were edible, but over curried (this coming from a die hard curry addict) and they were lacking that seasoned wok flavor. \n\nMy husband's dish was sad. The portion was teeny, and the jumbo shrimp were no larger than the standard shrimp at Red Lobster. The flavor was just eh. He was so disappointed that he called over the manager and told her they should take the dish off the menu (true, but I was still embarrassed!). When he asked why in the world this dish was $26, she said it was the XO. For $26, my husband should have at least gotten tipsy off the noodles. He didn't. I am generally okay with a Strip premium, but this was unacceptable for a pretty casual dining experience with mediocre flavor and sub par service.  \n\nMy visions of a happy, noodle filled belly were squashed.

Everything is on the pricier side so be prepared or head to one of the many Chinese restaurants along Spring Mountain Road."

The orange chicken was bland and more crispy than anything. The fried rice rocked! The pho was good, but the beef in it was incorrigible -- tough and had to be cut on a plate, but a nice addition once added.\n\nThe service left something to be desired. Nice folks though."

Appetizers arrived before main courses and the food was mediocre at best.  I was positive that I'd been here 2-3 years ago and I'm sure I was at some version of the restaurant then but it looks like it moved and is now located in an annex of the cafe next door.  Funny how a bad atmosphere can make a meal feel cheap and that's what's happening at Mandalay Bay's Noodle Shop."

It worked quite well in a pinch when we were having a hard time trying to figure out what to do for food before our airport shuttle arrived."

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  \n\nWe ordered the \"Roasted Crispy Duck\" appetizer and was told that it actually wasn't crispy, but just roasted.  We got it anyway and it was disgusting.  The taste was lousy and it was some of the worst duck I've ever had.  \n\nWe also ordered the Cashew Chicken.  Our waitress came out about 5 minutes after we ordered and told us they were out of cashews, but they would make it without cashews.  Are you kidding me?  They ran out of cashews?\n\nOur waitress was awful.  She was extremely annoying and her manager wasn't any better, as she seemed about as clueless as the waitress.  \n\nI give you all the same advise I told people looking at the menu when we were leaving: this place is terrible.  Don't eat here."

As for me, I remember seeing the noodle shop, and having some hot noodle soup or chow mein sounded yummy after drinking all weekend. So, our group headed over to the noodle shop.\n\nFirst off, the service is really really bad here. The service is slow, and half of the staff doesn't know what they're doing. Granted you don't get good service in a Chinese place, it was still worse than many other places. Our waiter just didn't care about anything, and never came back to ask how our food was or refill our water. On top of that, we wanted to split the bill at the end. So the way we usually do that, is write each person's last 4 digits of their credit card number and the amount they want to have charged on their card. At every restaurant, waiter's are please to see us make it so easy for them, and have it done right away. However, the staff here just couldn't figure it out. We waited a total of 20 minutes just to get our bill back. I noticed that there was about 4 people trying to handle the bill, and none of them could get it, so they finally had the manager come out. After the whopping 20 minutes, we finally got our bill back.\n\nAs for the food here, let's just say I much rather go to Panda Express for my Chinese food. I ordered chow mein, and it was soo bland and soo oily and greasy. I can't cook Chinese food for shit, and I could whip something better up.\n\nOverall, I was really disspointed since I was craving some good , or even settle for decent, Chinese food. Good thing I went over to my aunt's house after and she made me some amazing Cantonese food."

Imagine putting chicken in your mouth and tasting beef.\n\nKung Pao Chicken was way sour and dulled down.\n\nCury Crab Potstickers were good.\n\nOverall, a mediocre meal for $60. Keep walking. There are better places at Mandalay Bay."

I had the crazy idea that the larger casinos' restaurants would at least be \"decent\", so I didn't check Yelp beforehand. I should have known better!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered pho and I ordered vegetable pad Thai. We split the seaweed salad as an appetizer. The seaweed was good but the added tofu was unnecessary. Overall though, pretty good. Since there aren't many vegetarian options on the menu, I asked if the pad Thai could be made with vegetables instead of meat. She said that wouldn't be a problem. \n\nOur dishes came and I was disappointed to see that my entree consisted of nothing more than orange, oily noodles and a few pieces of onion. That's it. No extra veggies, peanut crumbles or fresh bean sprouts. I'm sure it would have been acceptable for some hungover frat boy, but I expected a little more. It lacked the taste and texture that's pretty standard at even the worst Thai restaurants. My boyfriend compared his soup to \"mall pho\" and it was missing the traditional condiments. \n\nOverall, this place definitely wasn't worth the price and I recommend skipping it."

The vegetable curry I had was not very spicy, was heavy on the eggplant, and was only ok.  The best thing we ordered was sweet and sour chicken, but it was't much better than panda express and sure cost a lot more!  Wish I would have consulted yelp! before checking this place out.  One plus was that the service was friendly."
