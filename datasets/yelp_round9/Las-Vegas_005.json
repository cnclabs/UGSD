Service was impeccable, they sure know how to handle the Vegas tourists. The crab fried rice and the papaya salad were also among my favorites. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the sausage. Nam Kao was amazing as well!"

Thankfully, that came pretty quick.  \n\nAnd let's just say that medium equals hot. The Tom Yum soup was delicious and got all my senses flowing.  \n\nLoved the drunken noodles as well. But I really enjoyed the chili dip was some fresh vegetables. A very unusual dish.  \n\nSo overall, a must-eat in Vegas."

The shrimp was deshell but still attached at the butt and deep friend and seasoned very well.  The beef salad was also very good with chunky piece of meat. The pad thai was good a int of sweet and lime. The crispy duck in panang curry was cook very well not too dry and the curry did not over power the duck."

            "review": "I had the perfect opportunity try another Thai restaurant in Vegas one that if live on the other side of town say is the best Thai food in Vegas. Since I live on the other side of town so prefer Archi and even after solid Thai food at Lotus of Siam still would take Archi. I went with big group there was 9 of us in all. So best part about that was did I get too try everything and the kitchen sink. Believe had over ten different dishes in all so just going too pick out the ones that stood out for me.\n\nThe crispy duck pagnang was very very good. The crispy duck something that could have had whole dish of by itself. It had the perfect crispy crust that crunch every time and still meat is moist. You combine it with sauce over rice. Fabulous! We had four different types of noodles from the traditional pad thai too other ones on menu gear more toward certain regional style. The pad thai was solid. Lo mein type of noodle really enjoyed because not normal one orange in color and tasty noodle. The pineapple fried rice was ok different but not something would order again. Green Papaya Salad had nice spicy kick too it. Solid choice. The winner for me was the FRIED BANANAS. Bananas wrapped in lumpia wrapping deep fried too perfect crispy brown and felt like hogging them all too myself. \n\nThe location is one less then desirable part of town. It amazing never judge book by its cover. You walk into the place really small hallway too all sudden opens too restaurant hold over or close too 100 people. They had nice wine cellar that see lot of the win on the menu, It become popular cult almost they have pictures all famous people that have dined there on the walls. If run out of conversations look around guess who who on the walls. The menu is pretty massive in choices. So sure there is something there appeals too everyone. The service went on friday night even packed surprising was really quick once we got the orders in. There was no miss up and great service from start too end. Only negative is too far for me. Not sure the next time visit but if ever out in that area need Thai fix LOS the place too go."

            "review": "Ive eaten at MANY Thai restaurants, and to me this was a total disappointment. I read the other reviews on here and was eager to try this place out. The portions that they served us were small compared to other restaurants that I've been to. We had the pad Thai and one of they're curries. I thought well their portions might be small but lets give them the benefit of the doubt, all i have to say about the taste is there a dozen more restaurants that i rather eat at. I DO NOT recommend this place at all. Its extremely Americanized, if you've never eaten Thai before you'll love it. But if you have something to compare it to you'll be disappointed!!!!"

            "review": "So, there's been a major hype about this place for a LOOOOOOONG time. I stopped by here back in 2008, and got a ton of food as a take-out and wasn't impressed at the time. \n\nMy second visit was back in 2011, and I thought the food was good at that time, but wasn't blown away. \n\nMy recent visit, I went with a group and ordered several different items to try.\n\nGarlic prawns- 5 stars. This is a must order. I would come back and get this without a question. \n\nCrispy duck panning curry - 2 stars. The panang curry was a bit lacking for me, and the duck was the best part. \n\nStuffed chicken wings- 5 stars. This dish is SOOOO Good. It is stuffed with the insides of vietnamese egg roll type ingredients. I LOVED it. \n\nDrunken noodles- 2 stars.  I did a double take on this dish, as it was supposed to be an entree, but looked like an appetizer. I felt soooo jipped, and the dish wasn't even that great either. The chicken pieces were dry, and the noodles did not have good flavor. \n\nCrispy rice dish appetizer- 2 stars.  This dish has basically the flavors of larb on crispy rice. I LOVE larb, and prefer to have it incorporated into ground meats, so I thought this was meh. \n\nI hear this is one of the best thai places. I've given three tries to finally write this review, and I gotta say, maybe there's too much hype?"

Lotus of Siam is the best Thai I've ever eaten.  Every time I go to Vegas that is my first stop, I always order extra and eat that for breakfast the next day.

            "review": "Oh my goodness!  We drove here under recommendation of a friend.  It is amazing!   Non descript little strip mall on the edge of town.  When we pulled into the parking lot at 12pm,  patrons were doing nothing short of running to the door to claim their table.  The crispy rice appetizer was a rocket fire explosion of flavors.  We had the Tom Kah Kai soup, Pad Se-Ew with chicken, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves, all washed down with Thai Iced Tea and Singha and finished off with the delicious banana roll with coconut ice cream for dessert.  As my dearly departed father would have said, \"this meal was a religious experience!\"  Highly recommended!"

            "review": "HAD to try this place after Anthony Bourdain's recommendation on Parts Unknown, and I FELL IN LOVE!!! if you watched that episode of Parts Unknown, the guy that Anthony Bourdain eats with at this restaurant says to try something from the \"northern\" part of the menu, and he's right!! DON'T try anything typical - pad thai, pad see ew, etc. BRANCH OUT!!\n\nUnder the \"northern\" section, we chose the Khoa Soi with beef, which is a noodle dish with a sauce that is similar to panang, but lighter. Under the \"chef's special\", we ordered the Crispy Duck Panang because it was so popular on Yelp. OH. MY. GOSH. Both of those dishes were delicious. But the Crispy Duck Panang was on another level. The duck was so well prepared. You can taste the crispiness of the skin. I expected the duck to be soggy because it's in the panang sauce, but no. It was fresh, it was crispy, it was delicious. There is definitely a lot of spice in the dish, but it was still amazing.\n\nPortions wise, each dish was on the small side. I typically only finish half of my entree from most restaurants, but I was able to finish my crispy duck panang and my boyfriend was able to finish his dish as well. The price point is also pretty high - over $20 for each of the dishes, but they were definitely worth it. I've never tried thai food like this before.\n\nWait time: we came on a monday night, about 20 minutes after they open and it was already pretty packed in the restaurant. One hour after it opened, there was a huge gathering of people waiting for tables. If you can, get a reservation or come when it opens because you definitely need to try it."

            "review": "My friend who lives in vegas warned me that the prices were steep and the portions are small. And he was right. Everything that was on the menu was at least 2 to 7 dollars too expensive. I ordered the thai fried rice with pork and the nam prik ong (best thing I ever ate-food network). The thai fried rice was not only small, but also generic. The saving grace was the nam prik ong. Other than that, most of the menu items can be found at sanamluang in Hollywood, California (thai town). Sanamluang not only tastes better than Lotus of Siam, but also costs less and offers more portions. To be frank, I was tempted in giving this place a 2 star review. The nam prik ong was delicious, but wasn't worth the ten bucks I paid for it. The small serving of nam prik ong showed me that this place was nothing but a scam on people who can't get good thai food in Las Vegas. Alas, the nam prik ong did taste good, so I must give this place one star above two. Overall, I regret spending $20 something dollars here."

It's actually a bit expensive but worth every penny. The ingredients and quality of food is superb. \n\nYou can even see all the celebrities and well known figures coming to the restaurant and their picture with the owner is on the wall. Even top chefs from all over the world come here to eat! It's seriously THAT good! We always get the prawns and sausage.suer tasty! I am a bit boting and I also get the pad see ew and thai tea but its so yummy, I just can't help myself. But they are more known for Northern Thai cuisine so I highly recommend you select their specialties instead."

            "review": "You've got to stray from the strip for this one, but it is definitely worth it. On Sundays they open at 5:30. Our group of 12 arrived at 5pm to see many people already lining up! There is one line for reservations, which they will let in first, and 1 line for people without. Don't let the shabby strip mall fool you, this Northern Thai restaurant is worth heading out to. You can tell that it is where the locals go.\n\nThe food came out hot and fast. We ordered A LOT. For many dishes you can choose your numbered spice level, so we often ordered a few of the same dishes at different levels. My favorite dish was the Garlic Prawns. These were full of garlic flavor, large and crunchy from being fried. Many in the group enjoyed the Crispy Duck in Panang Curry. The duck is served on top, and you mix it all into the curry. Crying Tiger Beef was another favorite of mine. While it was one of the more simple dishes, the thin beef was perfectly cooked to medium rare, and the jus on the side completed the dish. \n\nFor dessert, I loved the Coconut Ice Cream. They make it with real coconut. It was so light and icy, almost a sorbet texture, while being full of coconut flavor. A great find and a great meal overall."

Granted it was on the freaking pricey side but at least it was tasty. \n\nSea bass w drunken noodles: bomb sea bass. It was perfectly fried. It wasn't too breaded. The fish really held on its own. The noodles were spicy but not too spicy. \n\nGarlic prawns: they hooked it up. I mean I guess they should for the price. It was so crispy and tasty. I ate the heads whole. If you're not eating the head then you're missing out. Waste not, want not. \n\nTom yum soup: they use fresh mushrooms. Other places will use canned mushrooms. It was good. My boyfriend was hungover and it got his stamp of approval. \n\nNam Prik Ong: it was okay. I thought it was going to be better because it was on the food network. It reminded me of tomato sauce with pork. I was hoping it would be spicy, it wasn't. The chicharron was the best part."

They put so many different spices to get the right flavor, that at when you're almost finished with it, you can't eat it bc the curry has too much spices and crap. \n- The bowl is CURRY (which to me, honestly is soup, lol, but really not bc its just without coconut milk) is about the size of a bowl of cereal or as much as you get when you make maruchan. haha\n- This place should be called TAPAS of Siam!!!"

            "review": "I recently (the past 2 years) have gotten into Thai food and I love it. This place came recommended to me by a friend who is originally from Okinawa and knows good Asian fare. \n\nFirst off let me say that it is in a strip mall that you would not ever go to unless you were going here. If you think to yourself on the way that \"this cannot possibly be the place\" then you are headed in the right direction. The good news is once you get there it's a totally different scene on the inside. Deceptively large and always busy, this place sports a really fine wine selection and some of the best Thai cuisine on the planet.\n\nMy friends who live in LV and have been to Thailand several times say it is the real deal for authentic and the menu is almost overwhelming with original Thai dishes. \n\nSo for starters the Thom Ka is excellent, 1-10 spice scale and it comes in a hot pot with the flame going strong as it delivered to the table. It is certainly enough to share but of course you have to agree on the spice level. \n\nI am curry junkie so that's the route I usually go, and the Panang is my flavor of choice, no matter the meat I have not been disappointed ever with the quality. I have had Chicken and Shrimp Panang and both were excellent.\n\nOn one trip to Lotus we had a hard core vegan among us, this was no problem at all and they made everything to order just the way she wanted it and got really creative and used veggies and fruits that none of us besides her had ever heard of. \n\nI am always amazed at the shear volume of people coming through this place. On the weekend you cannot get in, they do take reservations but they normally don't answer the phone, as it is so busy so go during the week and expect a wait even then or eat later that seems to work too.\n\nSo go here and get anything you want, I would recommend this place for those new to Thai and veterans alike as everyone can get something they will love."

I went with only 1 other person so I wasn't able to order many things, which made me sad, but what made me EVEN more sad was the $30 cab ride it took to get here. SIGHPIE. We ordered:\n\n2 thai teas - average\n1 pad thai - really good, I was pleasantly surprised and the portions are ok\n1 green chicken curry - the sauce is really thin and milky, definitely not enough meat or veggies in this dish\n1 famous fried shrimp - this is probably my FAVORITE thing so far. The shrimp was crunchy and flavorful. Definitely worth the $15 price tag\n1 ground pork with spices appetizer - probably the most disappointing. This dish was unusually sour, like so sour it was hard to even swallow it without a huge gulp of water. When I gooogled this place, this was one of the most popular dishes. I say, if you're used to common simple thai dishes, this is not going to be to your liking"

Located in the heart of buffet capital of the US (i.e. Vegas), Lotus of Siam is definitely one that you should stop by to check out.\n\nRecommendation: The beef noodle soup is the most bomb soup I've had ever. So flavorful - especially with the different herbs, including cilantro. The beef is also extremely tender and delicious, and the noodles - thick rice noodles - go so well with the beef. I had about 3 bowls...soooo good.\n\nThe Pad Thai was also very good. The greasiness was not overwhelming like a lot of pad thai could be. The spicy-ness level was perfect - I always hate it when they assume that people can't take spicy-ness and make it mild and boring. The noodles were also nice and chewy, just like how I love my pad thai. \n\nThe red curry chicken is also pretty delicious, as well as the fried bananas. The rest of the offerings were good but not great, but make sure you eat the the beef noodle soup, pad thai and red curry chicken.\n\nThe price is also extremely reasonable - only $11 for the lunch buffet!"

I went with my family and ordered musaman curry, yum neau(beef salad), chicken sautee, fish cakes, sticky rice, and a dish that's like Thai salsa, etc. You gotta believe me that we were not disappointed at all. My mom was very happy to see that they added in Northern Thai dishes, because most Thai restaurants don't! I laugh at everyone who goes to this restaurant and orders pad thai, there's so much more deliciousness than pad thai!! Service was super slow and they barely came by to check up on us. We waited for our food for 30 minutes, but it was all worth it. The ambiance is very nice.

Great beef salad, excellent curries, grilled chicken, wonderful homemade ice cream.  We've tried a lot of different dishes and everything we've had was great.  Ask for recommendations from the waiter also: that 's how we tried the catfish and the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice with pork sausage.  They also have a great selection of Northern Thai dishes that you rarely find in other places.  \n\nOnce, we tried to order the mango with sticky rice but they warned us beforehand that the mangos weren't fully ripe and gave us a sampling of the mango to test whether we really wanted it.  It tasted OK, perhaps a little less sweet than a ripe mango in-season.  We decided to go with some of their home-made coconut ice cream instead.  I think this anecdote really shows the detail and care they put into their food.  \n\nThey have a lunch buffet on the weekends (geared more toward the locals or the typical tourist) which I wouldn't recommend, but you can still special order dishes during that time.  They apparently have a world-class wine list as well, but I haven't tried it; with the heat of Thai food, I always find myself craving a beer.  \n\nDespite all the fancy, big-name restaurants in the city, the meals I have here are always the most memorable."

First lets start with atmosphere, the place is way down the strip where i don't normally roam. Located in a huge ass parking lot which looks like a strip mall is this gem in what is or was old vegas. Inside this dead looking place its packed, like i had to push my way through the front (lunch time) to put my name down on this long ass waiting list. Hit the bar in the restaurant where we were given a thick ass drink menu i mean thick!! stuck to the basics thai chang beer but for this place being packed we were seated fairly quick 20min at most. Now to the food... got the northern style food and with nothing to compare this restaurant to I'm going by my experience with curries and asian dishes. Started with crispy rice, the fried duck pannang and the garlic fried shrimp... one word AMAZING!! the crisp rice was good but very heavy on the lemon grass which over powered the dish but was still good. The crispy duck was my favorite, now if you have ever tried duck you know that well most places do not know how to cook it and being Chinese decent we know our duck and well so does lotus of siam, cooked perfectly crispy still even when submerged in curry! next the fried garlic shrimp mmmmm, deep fried and very tasty. The service here was on point and when i mean on point, full waters, back to back beers and fast check turn around. Overall I'm a fan for a very delicious meal, yeah i cant base it for any other northern thai restaurant but as far as taste goes this place is amazing and i will be back thank you Anthony bourdain"

After hearing a lot of great things about the dishes, we all took a bunch of cabs from the Strip to come into the side strip mall the restaurant was located. The decor inside was a little dated, but was relatively well-kept, and we were seated right away, as it was a weekday, on the later side of the lunch hour.\n\nOur group had a lot of different types of diners, some adventurous and some not quite as adventurous, so it was good that the menu was very extensive, so that there was just about something for everyone, from fried rice and pad see ew, to more traditional Northern Thai dishes. I personally got the crispy duck penang, which was excellent. The fried bits held up really well in the curry, and the flavors with the rice made me want more and more curry. We also got the garlic prawns, and the Nam Prik Ong (chili dip). The prawns were really great and flavorful, although the chili dip was just okay to me. I liked the intense flavor of the dip, but the crudite it came with was a bit disappointing.\n\nService was fairly spotty throughout the meal, as we were constantly asking for drinks and water refills. To be fair, we were a large group, but on the other hand, the place wasn't particularly busy, as only a few other parties were in the restaurant. The prices were definitely on the expensive side for Thai food, but as some of us went for the more adventurous dishes to try, the bill was a little higher.\n\nWould definitely recommend if you're trying to get off the Strip for a meal. There really is something for everyone, and the popular dishes are really something you should go for."

The crunchy pork skins and vegies to dip were perfect for the dish, especially if you are trying to stay away from carbs.\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice)\nOk this dish was pretty addicting. Basically crunchy rice with all the typical great Thai flavors. A must get.\n\nVery excited at this point...\nbut unfortunately down hill from here.\n\nGarlic Prawns\nVery disappointing especially for $24. The ingredient's quality and portion size was well worth the price but the flavor and preparation was lacking. You could tell the oil the prawns were cooked in was not hot enough since they just weren't crispy enough to eat the shells, and we LOVE eating shrimp shells and all. The prawn were also lacking any flavor besides fried prawn.\n\nPanang Beef\nBasic dish which was mediocre even compared to our local hole in the wall Thai restaurant we go to locally.  Also, not spicy at all at level 7. Again disappointment.\n\nSometimes it depends which dishes you get a restaurant and that may me the case for us.

I thought that with it being almost closing time, restaurant would be pretty empty.\n\nWe waited for about 5 minutes before we got seated.  We got to sit at a bigger table so there's plenty of room.  The staffs were friendly and efficient.  Our food orders came out quickly.  \n\nfried tofu (bean curd) -- nicely fried tofu with cabbage strips on the bottom and a side of plum sauce.  The tofu was crispy on the outside and silky on the inside.  I like it a lot.  \n\nroasted duck curry -- the flavor was good.  You get pieces of roasted duck with pineapple pieces and the usual veggies.  Not too spicy.  Good for people who like some heat but don't want to start sweating from it.   But for people who like extra spicy food or who wants to sweat, I think you can probably ask them to make it more spicy.  Entree comes with a side of rice.    \n\ngarlic shrimp -- jumbo plump shrimps deep fried with the shell on.  The shrimps were butterflied before frying so it's so crispy that you can actually eat the shell .  The flavor was on point.  If you like you can dip it in plum sauce, but there's enough flavor where you didn't have to.  I enjoyed this dish.\n\npad se eww -- Nice flavor, well cooked, and not overly greasy.

It didn't wow me, but it was still very good. \n\nI kind of wish I did get typical Thai fare like Pad Thai/Rad Na or whatever and compare it to the stuff I usually get in San Diego/Portland, but I'm glad we explored N. Thai cuisine! \n\nThanks AB."

We opted to order some drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. We had pad thai, crispy duck with panang curry, garlic prawns and nam prik. The pad thai had a njce combination of sweet, salty, sour and spicy. Noodles were cooked al dente. The crispy duck was really crispy, and I was impressed how the sauce was flavorful and well crafted. Their garlic prawns were indeed garlicky! They included the shells, which I doubted at first but ended up munching because it was crisp and delicious. I was not fond of the nam prik, although the sauce had good flavors and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. I will be back!"

From the reviews, I was expecting Lotus to blow my mind - and it didn't. \nDon't judge this place by it's cover - the outside looks pretty ghetto - the inside is MUCH better.\n\nAfter reading through some reviews, we ended up ordering:\n1)Tom Kah Kai - A distinctive soup of sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushroom galanga, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice. $4.95 for a cup - it was good, not the BEST I've had, but pretty comparable to other Thai restaurants. \n2)Nam Kao Tod -Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. - $7.95 : this had a lot of flavor, actually TOO much flavor. It was pretty salty. The first few bites were really good, after that, the flavor kicked in and it was hard to eat. Unique dish though, never had it before.\n3) Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck - Crispy duck topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil. Serve on the top of pan fried flat rice noodle. - $21.95 : this dish was GOOD, it could have used more noodles though - they gave us enough for one person, hardly enough for 2 people to share. Most people want more meat - and here we wanted more noodles, they gave us a good amount of crispy duck though. The flavors blended together perfectly. Would def. recommend this dish. \n4) Thai Iced tea - $2.50 each : the tea taste was stronger than any other Thai tea I've had - so if you're really into tea - that's a good thing. I'm not into that strong taste so I handed it over to my bf.\n\nDinner came out to be $42 exactly before tip. So if you get these dishes, expect to spend about $50. and that's with no dessert. =(\n\nThe best Thai restaurant in North America? I have to disagree. It's ok, but definitely not the best. I guess that's what happens when places are hyped - you expect too much. If you come here not expecting much, maybe it will live up to the hype. Sorry ya'll."

The wait did not bother us but the restaurant did. \n\nFirst, the ambiance - this is nothing but more than a regular Thai restaurant in any of the US cities. It is a large, noisy, and very crowded setting in a banquet hall. Seats are very uncomfortable, some chairs are even rocking and we were fearful that it could break in any given time. Very plain setting on the table, with one fork and paper napkin. This is certainly not a fine dining restaurant. \n\nThe decor of this place is also very plain. Only a few pictures and some ribbons hanging in a on the walls. Feels like eating in a mess hall. \n\nA  bare minimum service level is provided. Our waiter came to take our order and offered us some suggestions. The dishes were presented to us by the carriers and the waiter checked back with us only once. Water was never refilled. \n\nNow the food. We ordered:\n\n1. Golden Tofu as an appetizer - these are cubes of tofu deep fried. Indeed these are chunks of tender tofu, unfortunately, it has zero flavoring. One must use the accompanying sauce ( a sweet lime sauce ) for flavoring. Many other Thai restaurants can do a better job. Price of this dish is $7.95.  Grade B-.\n\n2. Garlic Prawn deep fried - there are 6 pcs of shrimp, size 16 to 20, The shells comes with this dish and they are deep fried solidly and are crispy. Unfortunately, it is slightly too greasy,\nIn addition, the shrimp is not flavorful and is slightly over fried. Price of this dish is $27.95. Grade C. \n\n3. Crispy Duck in a curry sauce - there are about 12 pcs of thinly sliced duck breast in a coconut cream yellow curry sauce. This is the best dish of the evening. The sauce is great over rice and the duck breast is tender. If you like Thai yellow curry sauce, you will love this dish. Price is $27.95. Grade A. \n\n4, Kang Hung Lay - Pork stew in a northern Thai curry sauce. Small chunks of pork along with one large piece of pork belly simmered in a curry sauce. Very flavorful, but the meat is not tender. Price is $17.95. Grade C.\n\n5. Mua Yum Kattie - grilled strips of beef in a sweet and sour Thai sauce. Beef is quite tasty but kind of tough. Price is very reasonable at $10.95. Grade B-. \n\nIn addition, we ordered two Thai ice coffee which is quite well done. Grade A. \n\nThe food bill came to $102+. Then they add a mandatory 18% service charge in addition to the local tax. The total is then $130.\n\nAll in all, the food is OK and acceptable. I will recommend this place to my friends if only they can accept the mandatory 18% service charge,  zero ambiance, below acceptable service level and the high price they charge on the food,"

With spicy level 6, it just had a nice kick without being hot. Perhaps Northern Thai is a little more relaxed than other places I have been with they spicy level. Our table tried everything from En Tuan soup (beef tendon with a deep rich broth and a huge basil taste), to Kang Hung Lay (Pork \"stew\" curry). \n\nWhat the group liked the most was the lightness of the dishes. The focus on herbs, spices and not coconut cream really allowed us to fill up without feeling weighed down.\n\nMy only regret is not getting the Nam Prik Ong, but that will happen next time!"

I wouldn't say hidden because this place was packed and very popular with the locals and I, being a native of Cali, this place was a good find.\n\nI'm not familiar with Thai food at all so I had to yelp it to see what people craved here. Only thing I knew on the menu was pad tai noodles.  Nam Kai Tod was a good appetizer to begin with. Some sort of sweet crispy brown rice. You have to try this if you have not before.  My partner in crime ordered the glass noodle salad which had a very lime taste to it.  I love sour food and the flavor was just perfect.  It's not an appetizer but it might as well be because even an anorexic can't get full from the amount of glass noodles that was served.  Best to order one for yourself instead of having to share it just as I and my friend did.  Next on the line was the drunken seafood noodle. I'm not very good in describing flavors but I'm just here to tell you this was freaking delicious. It gave many options of flavors in one plate, from shrimp to muscles and the noodles in it.  And the last was the dessert! Damn I've never had one this good. Coconut ice cream on sticky sweet rice. One word to describe this is, can I have some more!? Alright it wasn't one word but you know what i mean.\n\nThe only sour taste that came out from this was I had to pay for her too. Wtf, she's my ex, haven't the rules changed? I ain't gotta pay for you no more, but I hate looking like cheap boyfriend in front of the server because we look like we're on a date.  \n\nDefinitely give this place a try, especially if you're an out of towner because this place has won many food critics and awards."

The first time I came here was about two years ago and right after enjoying the Nutcracker at the Smith Center. \n\nI had read about this place before and looked at its list of reviewers.  One after the other giving it praise.  \n\nI convinced my family to try it out and once we parked I could tell no one was thrilled about the way it looked from the outside or the sketchy area it seemed to be in.  Once we walked inside, I could tell it was huge, way bigger than it gives off from the outside and it was jammed packed ( always a good sign when trying someplace new).  The host told us it would be a 2 hour minimum wait.  At those words my BF began to walk back towards the door, he hates waiting, let alone two hours ( which, when youre hungry is an eternity). I was so excited to try it but two hours is kinda long, we could always come back! \n\nAs I begin to make my way to the door a man standing in line, leans over and tells me its worth the wait.  Dammit, now I want to wait.  \n\nI round everyone back up and tell them its going to be amazing.  We can wait!  Plus we can enjoy each others company and spend some quality time chatting with each other.  \n\nIf youve ever been there before, youll know that there isnt really anywhere to wait. Sure, you could go outside, but in December its a bit chilly.  Inside, theres a little waiting room that holds about four people max.  Its pretty tight and those chairs should be saved for someone that perhaps cant stand as long.  \n\nWe end up against the glass wall to the wine room.  In the direct path of all the waiters pushing carts loaded with hot plates of amazingness, back and forth from the kitchen to the large dining room near the bar.  Talk about torture.  \n\nOur wait ended up being about 1:45 minutes and after viewing and smelling the amazing dishes going back and forth we had a good idea of what we wanted.  And you know what?  Completly worth it!!!\n\nWe ordered a few different plates and shared them all.

I have had my fair share of Thai food so I did not understand how one place could be so highly regarded.  While I could honestly say I was not blown away by anything I tried, I did enjoy the flavors and the service leaving me with a great dining experience.  Plus, their menu is pretty extensive so if I am in Vegas again, I am ready to make another trip to try some of their other items.\n\nHere are some of the things that I tried on my first trip:\n\nNam Kao Tod: A crispy rice dish that sizzles with heat and flavor.  Each kernel of rice was almost fried to a crisp in an oil with a mixture of peppers and spices.  They provide several slices of cabbage and cucumber which help provide a nice counterbalance to the rice.  \n\nGarlic Prawns: Given the high regard for these, here I was a little underwhelmed.  When the dish arrives, you will see the piece of meat hanging from the shell, all of which had been fried to a nice crisp.  While it smells absolutely like something you would come to expect from a dish called garlic prawns, the meat itself was a little lacking in that garlic flavor.  The true flavor actually came from the shell itself which was not necessarily as enjoyable to bite into.  \n\nRoasted Duck Curry: A balance of spicy and sweet with generous pieces of duck make this a recommend.  Sure, in terms of flavor, it is what you would come to expect from your usual curries.  However, the actually chunks that were in the curry were impressive - fresh and vibrant. \n\nIn terms of service, they were really great.  The servers were very attentive to our needs and would do things to make sure everything was okay.  The parking lot is huge so no worries about that but you may have to worry about the wait.  It is usually recommended to make reservations which is possible online.  If you are unable to secure a reservation online, you can put your name on the waitlist online as well.  Make sure to arrive on time or you risk losing your spot in line!\n\nOverall, Lotus of Siam does have good Thai food that is definitely worth checking out!"

Unlike last time where came in the evening and waited an hour and eventually had to take to-go. \n\nFirst, it took them 15 mins for them to take our order. Then I was waiting for my food. Everyone finished their food before they brought out my dish. And when they did, they got the order wrong. After waiting another 20 mins, they got the order wrong a second time, so I asked for them to take it off the check. Considering that it wasn't that busy, I'm not sure why service is so bad.\n\nAlso, the lunch buffet doesn't really get refilled much after 2.\n\nFood's good. Service was terrible, and they didn't seem to give a shit. If we ever choose to come back, we'll probably just order to-go next time!"

Curious, we decided to give it a try.\n\nFirst of, you wouldn't expect to find a great place for food in the run-down \"mini-mall\" that it is located in. One advice, go there during \"lit hours\" if you are by yourself.  Luckily, it's still light out after 7pm.  \n\nWe walked in at 7pm on a Thursday night without reservations and the place was pretty full.  At first the guy told us it would be at least a 30 minute wait but then said that he could seat us if we didn't take more than 1 hour. Since it was just the 2 of us, we said of course! I would recommend reservation esp if you have a big party.  It looks like they had a separate section for a bigger party (maybe 20+) but the biggest table I saw sat 12 people comfortably.  \n\nThe food was excellent!  We skipped the appetizer and went straight for the meal. We had the green papaya salad, drunken seafood noodles, and red curry with chicken.  We asked for everything mild and It was \"just right, a little sweat and tears\" spicy.  It came with a side of jasmine rice but we had 1 order of sticky rice esp for the curry! Yum!  The portions weren't huge but between the both of us, we ate pretty much everything.  Now, we could've been done without desert but the table next to us ordered a whole bunch and we couldn't resist!  So, we had shared 2 of them: fresh sliced mango with sticky rice topped with a light cream sauce AND coconut ice cream. Oooooh, so yummy!  Yes, we finished that without a problem.\n\nThe service was good.  We had a bunch of people helping us and our water glass was never empty.  Thank goodness with all the spicy-ness!  The one thing I thought was strange was that after we got our food, no one came by to ask us how things were until we were almost done eating everything. Then again, maybe that's probably why huh? They probably didn't want to interrupt the \"shoveling\" of food! Ha! \n\nWe will definitely go again.  I'm curious about their lunch buffet that was being advertised as $8.95.  Our meal described above (including desert) was all under $50!  Thanks for all of your reviews. We just found a new great place for Thai!!!!"

After reading all the rave yelp reviews about this place, I was really looking forward to trying out some of their classic dishes -- garlic prawns and crispy duck -- but the food turned out nothing special: it was merely comparable to other neighborhood Thai restaurants yet came with a higher price tag (hence two stars instead of three). I guess they are relying on one-time customers for their business.\n\nThat said, I somewhat appreciated their Bangkok-style soup which has an interesting, complex flavor thanks to the combination of coconut milk, mushrooms, and lemongrass.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a reservation-worthy experience, I would recommend to look elsewhere...\n\nEdit: two days after I wrote my review, I received a comment full of insults. I sincerely hope this was a display of an inspired following of this restaurant (in that case, I am happy they found a place where they like to eat) rather than a regular business practice."

And most folks who eat here love it. Having said that, I just don't get Lotus of Siam. Sure, it's good; the curries are balanced and the salads, and noodle dishes are tasty, but I feel that this is a place that is more concerned with it's reputation as the premier Thai restaurant in the area than the menu. They have tailored their dishes for farang, (foreign), meaning our milder,  palates. What is with the wine obsession? I have never experienced a Thai restaurant anywhere that directs such focus on wine. Not that it's a bad thing, I personally enjoy a glass of Pinot Grigio with a Glass Noodle Salad, for example, but it comes off to me as a little snobbish. The staff are courteous, but seem harried and too busy. The service is good, but I like to chat in Thai to my server and or hostess, and they just don't seem to have the time. Those who are seeking authentic Thai food should try some of the other Thai restaurants in town. Each one is different and I don't really have a favorite, although the beef salad at Pin Kaow is excellent, the curries at Komol Kitchen are mind blowing, (the pastes are made from scratch), and the Larb at Ocha is the best I've ever had anywhere! Order it with sticky rice. There are a few Thai places in Vegas I've not tried, mostly because of their location relative to my home, but for my money, eating Thai means enjoying the personality of the restaurant, the proprietor, & the food. In these areas, Lotus of Siam is little better than average, and the lunch buffet is the only thing I eat there if I'm on my lunch break and am in need of a quick Thai fix. I can get in and out of there in a half hour, and make it back to work on time."

For sure the Garlic Prawns is a must. For me I loved the house special friend rice a lot because they did tomato fried rice with justice. It's surprisingly on the oily side so not everyone in my family enjoyed it like I did. Chop suey was also done right and if it wasn't for the price, I would order it over any other restaurant's. \n\nOther yelpers noted the dirty dishes. My experience was no exception as I had to ask for a new clean plate.\n\nDamage was around $60. Good for a date and food for the family every now and then but too rich for my blood."

However, the inside of the restaurant is nice enough--certainly more so than the outside.\n\nI was most impressed by two of our dishes on the night we went: (1) Tom Yum Kai and (2) Pad Thai. The Tom Yum was, for me, the perfect balance of spicy and sour. Some Tom Yums I've had tend to lean more toward the sweet/sour combo, so I loved LoS' rendition. The broth was pure tasting with the wonderful flavor of lemongrass which was not overpowering. \n\nFor their Pad Thai, LoS uses round noodles, making them different from the flat noodles I've had at every other Thai restaurant I've been to. The sauce for their Pad Thai was otherworldly. \n\nWe also had the mee kraab appetizer, green curry with tofu, and a Northern Thai curry dish with egg noodles and pickled vegetables. The mee kraab was very sweet with a hint of fish sauce, and was enjoyed by all at our table. I particularly loved the green curry, spicy, that was accented with wonderfully-cooked eggplant. And finally, I felt the Northern Thai dish was a bit one-dimensional with a heavy-handed red curry broth. \n\nLoS met the high expectations I had. When I return, however, I'll be sure to tell them to omit MSG from all my dishes, since they cook with it by default (but our server said they'll gladly leave it out upon request). LoS is a welcome respite from the strip--a very \"normal\" restaurant amidst the glitz and glamor of all that Vegas embodies. However, unlike most of Vegas, the quality of the food far outpaces the price."

The fish was so perfectly cooked and buttery that I won't be able to return here without getting it every time.  We also had the Nua Nam Tok, which was one of their many charbroiled beef options.  They do a good job with their beef and it had a great flavor with lots of heat.\nI do wish after all these years, the restaurant would improve its website.  The site has changed a few times, but it always seems to be hit or miss when I visit.  Stop with all the fancy stuff and just give me the basics: menu, hours, reservations.  Thanks"

However, you have a mission.  The mission, if you choose to accept it, is to eat the best Thai food in North America.  I, and I hope you, choose to accept it!\n\nI've eaten here twice.  The first time I got Tom kha kai and the special duck breast with drunken noodles.  The soup is INTENSELY flavorful.  The magic of Thai cuisine is the perfect balance of sweet, salty, sour, and piquant.  If you increase one, you have to increase the others.  Obviously, if you go overboard with any of them, the dish is ruined.  The soup was a perfect example of this philosophy - it was as flavorful as it could possibly have been.  If there was 1 more grain of salt, 1 drop of lime, it would have been too much.  The line of perfection is skirted so asymptotically, you'll think there IS no 99.99999999999%.\n\nYou'd think that, but you'd be wrong.  That extra 9 at the end?  The Tom yum goong will take you there.  Intense is all I can say - you cannot prepare your taste buds for the shock they will receive during a single bowl of this.  \n\nThe duck was cooked absolutely perfectly.  Crispy, delicious skin, perfectly rendered, tender meat.  The noodles were spicy, and perfectly complimented the duck.  \n\nThe Pla Laad Prik (whole fried fish with pepper sauce) was incredible.  It's exactly what it sounds like.  And it's delicious.\n\nOn top of all the incredible food (and to tame the heat, you are getting it spicy, right?), they have a huge list of Rieslings which are not only a perfect compliment to the meal, but are extremely reasonably priced.  \n\nForget whatever silly plans you had for a couple hours one night in Vegas; spend them here, getting a meal you will never forget."

Mind you, I was with my family and, my step mom is Thai. I thought it would give me bonus stepdaughter points so I was pretty excited to bring her to Lotus of Siam. \n\nThe Crispy Catfish Salad was great! The catfish pieces were fried crispy perfection and the salad tasted light to me. The dressing wasn't too salty nor too sour. I definitely loved it and was excited to have our other orders come out. \n\nThe food sure did start to come out one by one and sadly, I got disappointed. I don't know if it was because maybe what we ordered weren't their \"stellar\" dishes but oh, boy. I wasn't a happy camper. We got the Tom Yum Goong, Panang Curry, Pad Thai and my dad got an extra bowl of noodles in soup with meatball type things floating. \n\nI'm sorry, but my go-to spot in Thai Town in L.A. does a better job at preparing what I had ordered. That Tom Yum Goong was just pure sourness with no kick whatsoever (my stepmom asked them to make it spicy in Thai). The Panang and Pad Thai were both on the sweeter side as well. My stepmom agreed to what I had to say as well and, she's a straight-up, legit Thai lady herself. I only have the privilege of saying that I've been to Thailand but she's got it all in her blood. Her opinion has to count as something, right?\n\nI'm not ready to cross them out my list just yet. Everyone definitely deserves a second chance and I could have made a mistake in ordering Thai staples but, that's what scares me too. If the staples aren't even close to amazing then what more the dishes they're known for? I guess I'll just have to wait and see."

The bad dish this time was the fried dumplings.  Very bland, stuffed with a very small amount of meat, and very average.  \n\nLuckily, they served the Beef Jerky and the dumplings at the same time, so my friend was able to see why i like this place so much.  We got the Beef Jerky, Northern Style Pork Curry, Issan Sausage, Seafood with Drunken Noodle, and Coconut Ice Cream w/ Fried Banana Roll.  Everything was very good.  The sausage was very dry, but had a great fermented flavor, and when combined with the cabbage, fresh chiles, roasted peanuts, ginger, and cilantro, it covers the palate with different flavors that work together perfectly.  \n\nThe coconut ice cream was worth writing home about too!  Icy, refreshing, and full of fresh coconut flavor, this was the best way to end the meal since the Sticky rice w/ mango was not available as the mangoes were not in season.  \n\nOnce again, Lotus of Siam comes through!"

Meat can be loaded with gristle, overcooked, or undercooked. Curry can be oily, watery, too spicy, or too bland. Noodles can be too grainy or too soft, and break easily. \n\nLotus of Siam pretty much hit the mark on all of these counts for me. Here's our breakdown:\n\n- Chicken satay. Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken. This is usually the canary in the coal mine for me. The chicken was good quality, perfectly cooked, and seasoned so well that I didn't even feel the need to use peanut sauce.\n- Yellow curry with chicken. This is mostly the reason for my 5 stars. It's my habit to only eat the chicken and the curry sauce on my rice, but on these two counts, Lotus of Siam is among the best of the best for this dish for me. The consistency was perfectly creamy, and \"medium spicy\" (4 out of 10, I think was what we asked for) provided the perfect amount of spice for those of us who don't like a ton of spice in our curry. The chicken was again fantastic quality and perfectly cooked.\n- Pad see ew. This was a good dish. The noodles were prepared well, and the beef was very good!\n- Crispy duck. This was mostly okay for me, although I'm not a big fan of duck to begin with. The seasoning was definitely the highlight of this dish for me.\n\nWe came here for lunch as a group of about 7 or 8 and got pretty good service! They are only able to split checks 4 ways.

There are items on this menu that are absolutely magical, and are best eaten at a 7-8 level of heat. They are the Crispy Duck with Cream Cognac sauce, the Soft Shell Crap Salad, the Tom Kah Kai soup, and the Spicy Catfish with basil leaves. \n\nThey have an incredible wine list with lots of depth including  many Riesling flights. Rieslings pair marvelously with spicy Thai. They have even brought samples to the table to help us decide which to chose.The proprietor is well known in town for his cellar, and his markups are very reasonable. It's also a pleasant surprise to have wine presented so elegantly in this location (just as one would expect in a Michelin rated establishment.) \n\nAs for the dishes you would order in other Thai restaurants such as Larb, and Pad Thai - stay away from them - this is not the place. Be prepared to wait unless you make reservations the day before. Being locals, we expect a 45 minute wait."

Had pad thai, duck curry, a suggested pork dish, and their sea bass over drunken noodles.  \n\nAll of it was good, well balanced with flavors.  Not sure what it is with drunken noodles but it works.  The waitress recommended us to pair our sea bass with it and we're glad we listened.  They miss most of the pad thai for you when its served except for the nuts.  We went through half of before we realized it and finished mixing it in.  \n\nThe thai tea was on the sweet side so we added water to ours.  \n\nWe'd be back to try different dishes when we're in town."

Besides, soft shell crab pad kee mao is good, but in terms of actual exoticness it's not really all that exotic.\n\nThe big problem is two-fold because I'm almost never here on a weekday. They only do lunch on weekdays, and I'm not dealing with that line for dinner time (and let's be honest, no one actually plans dinner in Vegas if you're gonna go out). EXCEPT LAST TIME I WAS HERE ON FRIDAY AT NOON. Sorry Tacos El Gordo, I love you much but my lunch choice that day was not a hard decision to make.\n\nThe reason you go to lunch is simple...you walk in with zero wait. At least that's what's happened the only two times I've been here! And the thing about Lotus is this...it is unquestionably the best Thai restaurant in the city of Las Vegas and arguably the best in the entire country. So you don't go in there with the intention of getting the basic options. Unless for some reason you are a basic person, in which case I hope the gods have mercy on your soul.\n\nMy \"get all the options you can't get anywhere else\" principle truly applies here. My friends were just like...dude, have at it, we trust you. Well, here's the list:\n\n1. Crispy duck with penang curry: OMG IT'S THE BEST!\n2. Soft shell crab pad kee mao (again): I know it's a tad basic, but hey it was really good last time. Besides, you don't really see soft shell crab on pad kee mao anywhere else...so don't judge me! Next time though...sea bass pad kee mao. Because of this next item.\n3. Sea bass with chili sauce: Anyone that knows me knows I'm the biggest sea bass homer there is. This was so freaking good!\n4. Chicken pad thai: Ok fine we got the most basic thing you can possible get. But that's because my friend says it's his favorite dish to cook and he wants to see how every restaurant cooks it since it's always different depending on the cook. He approves!\n\nYeah, everyone was satisfied. I think I know a thing or two about decent Thai food options here lol. And the great thing is that because the menu is so ridiculously deep, I could come here 5 times and never order the same combination of items. \n\nOnly problem is actually finding time to come here again. I ain't trying to mess with that weekend line bruh."

Plus this was one of the few times I had a rental car available when visiting Vegas.\n\nFresh and marinated raw prawns with chili paste.. what a great and unique dish. The serving came with 8 large shrimp that I shared with dining companions, but I could have polished off a plate of these.  I also loved the crispy fried duck served with a congac based curry.  Again, another unique dish to me and I couldn't get enough.  We had other dishes that I can't complain about, but these two were clearly the standouts. \n\nOne thing I would mention, the spice level was not nearly as high as I assumed. We ordered \"medium\" and my next go round i would go high as I felt there wasn't much heat at all. That didn't take away from the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here. \n\nPrices are very reasonable for what you get. This is a very good choice to take a break from the flashy casino dining."

I was a big fan of the duck, super crispy skin, a serious crunch to it and then the soft tender meat underneath it all.\n\nNot really a fan of all the coconut curry stuff.  The Soup ended up being an unfinished dish on our table.  We even went mild so hot would be ridiculous, like ludicrous speed on space balls.  My belly was on fire after our dinner here.  I did need some smoothing desert and found some ice cream at my hotel to cure my stomach heat. \n\nI would put this on your list of must try in Vegas.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. I started with the chicken larb appetizer which was the best I'd ever had. Three of us dined \"family style\" so we were able to try a lot of different meals. I ordered the green curry which was very good...they are not shy with their spices, so buyer beware. (They can always cut the spice down if you get too ambitious.) Also had the Tom Kum Kai Bangkok soup which had me sweating and my sinuses cleared. We also passed around some Koong Tenn, a roasted shrimp plate that was by far the best meal ordered that night. The shrimp were huge and prepared perfectly. Definitely worth trying out, and I will be back next time I'm in town."

It was killer.\n\nThe spicy chicken wing appetizer was also as good as I have had. We are madly in love with the same dish at Bangkok House in Kona and yet we thought this was even better....the sauce was richer and more garlic. Also a killer dish.\n\nLastly was the pineapple fried rice which has curry powder added as a twist....something not normally done in Thailand. The dish was perfect and so tasty.........but it was small and for the money they should be using fresh pineapple not canned. But it was still good enough no need to complain and even the curry powder was a nice touch.\n\nOur waiter \"Tea\" is fantastic, great sense of humor.......and knows his stuff.

My partner ordered the Watermelon Fresca which was awful!  Next we placed our order for the Chicken & Waffles and ShortRib Bologne.  Nothing special here. Just so so!  The Chicken was over cooked dry and chewy.  The pickles severed on top of the chicken were excellent.  The ShortRib Bologne was fair, once again nothing special.

The garlic shrimp is something you might not want to share. It's really good. Crispy fried, garlicky salt sweetness actually makes the shell into a chip like snack almost. Everything else pales in comparison. I recommend sticking with the classic salads, pad thai and tom yum soup. I once or twice I veered off course and was a little disappointed. The curry without coconut milk tasted like a tom yum soup. I probably wouldn't be disappointed if they called it a soup rather than a curry. Their beef soup is more or less flavored for the white man's taste buds. Considering two people can only eat so much, I wish I tried something else. It was like a very sweet pho. Overall, my experience was great and I wish I could trust Yelp reviews on what to order, but everyone has different preferences."

We arrived a bit early and ordered a Singha to share. They have an extensive wine list with many by the glass but we'd just come from Valley of Fire and were thirsty, so beer seemed to fit the bill.\n\nIt wasn't busy yet so we got a lot of time with our waiter and asked him what he recommended. The menu is pretty extensive and there are a lot of really interesting things to choose from, good descriptions too! He pointed out a few house specials and we ended up ordering entirely from his recommendations. We started off with the crispy rice and sausage appetizer. My boyfriend loved it. I thought it was spicy and salty but didn't taste like much.\n\nThen, we ordered three dishes to share among three of us. Crispy duck with drunken noodles, short ribs in red curry, and the liver which the other two wanted to try. The crispy duck was by far the best of the three. Really delicious, good portion size too. The short ribs were amazing but there wasn't enough. I think there were four. For $20, I thought we'd get more than an appetizer size. But the sauce was really good over the rice. The liver tasted less like liver than I'm used to, the fresh lime and onion was really nice, but it was pretty dry and didn't come with any sauce. \n\nOverall, the ambiance of the place is okay. Not anything memorable and the lighting is bright and unremarkable. We liked the food but it's pretty rich and we felt a little ill later in the evening. It was pretty expensive too! I enjoyed it but don't feel a need to come back.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out how this place has over 700 reviews on Yelp and is so highly rated given that there is a lot of really good food in Las Vegas. It seems to have a very good PR person! I think it's unique and worth a visit but we had an incredible meal at a gorgeous Thai restaurant right off the strip  for much cheaper on a different night."

It is a heavy dish since its deep fried and I am glad I shared it with my wife.\n\nAs for the duck, it was over cooked and the curry sauce tasted too creamy/milky to me.  Overall a decent dish, but again, nothing special as far as I am concerned.\n\nMaybe if someone is coming into town from a small city that does not have a decent Asian restaurant selection, this place would be considered amazing.

Yumm crispy rice.  \n\nmusaman curry - To be honest the curry was a little thin and the flavor wasn't as deep and rich with spice as this place in Houston I love.  Ever since I ate the \"masamun curry\" there, that's the benchmark I place other curries at.  Lotus' curry was just so so.  However, the beef was great!

I would recommend this dish.  we got it with seafood, but there's a whole bunch of other variations you can get the noodles with.  \n\nI think the last thing we got was the red curry, but I'm not sure - I liked it better than the musaman curry, richer flavoring.  Decent choice.  \n\nService: really good for an Asian restaurant in a sketchy looking stripmall.

Nevada natives, Ethiopian, Vietnamese, and Nigerian ex-pats and a fiery Argentinian abuelita [although she didn't look a day over 50] were some of the most memorable faces.\n\nYet our driver on our trip to Lotus of Siam,  with whom I built the strongest rapport, was the most interesting of them all. Ironically, he was himself, Thai, and a former restauranteur in Las Vegas proper. We spoke of thai dishes, international travel and our mutual distaste for pad thai sauce in a bottle.\n\nAt some point during our dialogue, I asked the lingering question, \"So...is Lotus of Siam REALLY as good as they say it is? Is it the best Thai restaurant in the country?\" To this, he replied with a simple shake of his head and a \"No\". \"If you want good Thai food, go to Thai Town in Hollywood.\" He clarified.\n\nI am grateful to this man for lowering my expectations of Lotus of Siam, it's never a good idea to go into a restaurant experience believing that the food should be the \"BEST\" -- a recipe for disaster. So with a newly acquired, down-2-earth perspective, I entered the packed Lotus of Siam and prepared for a memorable experience.\n\nAmbiance:\n\nAfter the Travel Channel stakes claim to a restaurant, one of two things are bound to happen. Either the restaurant will cling to or completely abandon it's former character in the face of extreme \"over-night\" popularity. Fortunately, it seems that Lotus of Siam, while extremely crowded, has apparently retained most of it's pre-celebrity essence.\n\nIt looks like...well...a family-run Thai restaurant. The only difference was an entry w/o standing room, a policy that reservations are lost after 5 minutes of seating time [if a \"no-show\"], and an elaborate walk-in wine cellar in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nFood:\n\nThe Pad See Ew, Fried Rice and Mint Chicken where all winners; but the two dishes which stood out in my mind where the Garlic Prawns and Jackfruit Curry.\n\nGarlic Prawns: Full prawns, shells included, which where completely edible from head to tail. Crispy, moist and \u00fcber flavorful.\n\nThum Ka Noon: This northern-style, non-coconut milk curry is made with young jackfruit and shredded dried fish. The curry broth was like none I had ever tried. It was a fan-favorite around the table for dipping, showering over rice or straight up slurping!\n\nSo...who was right? Andrew Zimmern or my Thai cab driver? Is this really the best Thai food in the country? Clearly I am not qualified to answer this question. Yet, I can assert that the food was quite memorable and some of the best Thai food I have had to date. Additionally, their unique specialization of Northern Thai cuisine is hard to come by outside of Chiang Mai."

            "review": "Lotus is legit. You know it's legit when your cabbie perks up immediately when you mention that you want to be taken there from your hotel on the Strip. During my most recent trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago, I boarded a cab from the Palazzo and indicated to the cab driver to take me to the Lotus of Siam. He simply said in his Yugoslavian accent: \"best Thai food in Las Vegas...hell, best Thai food in the country! I love that place.\" It seemed like an honest review, but not Yelp Elite caliber. \n\nSo here goes mine, hopefully a bit more fleshed out:\n\nLotus lets people in around 5:30pm for dinner service. Knowing this, if you arrive a little before this time, you will see a group of people standing outside, all wanting to be the first one in. There's no order to the way people congregate outside, but there's an unspoken rule to just keep a mental tab as to who arrives after you, and when the doors swing open, to make it inside the restaurant before them. The sooner you sit, the sooner you eat! No pushing or shoving, though the temptation to invade others' personal space is strong as you try to think of what to order in advance in your head.\n\nAs you shuffle inside, you'll be greeted by newspaper snipets featuring Lotus in the local papers. You'll see plenty of photos of famous people (both American and presumably Thai) over the years, enjoying the food at this Las Vegas institution.\n\nAccording to others in my group, the restaurant was expanded relatively recently to include the empty neighboring space. That effectively allowed the owners to add a wine bar and a wine storage room, as well as more dining space. It doesn't seem like there's much activity going on at the strip mall where Lotus is located, so the whole wing of the building can be converted to more Lotus as far as I'm concerned. It would be way better that way, really.\n\nService has always been kind and friendly whenever I come here, as per Thai tradition. I've only been a couple of times, but with all the stuff I've ordered and shared with my group (it's an extensive menu), I did not find one thing I did not like.\n\nI recommend the jumbo fried shrimp/prawns to open things up. You can, and should, eat the skin. I don't usually do so with any fried shrimp, but the way it was cooked with the peppering and seasoning, it was almost like having twice as much prawn. Those will disappear in a couple of minutes (because of some secret crack-like substance that the cooks sprinkle into the batter, I'm sure), so I also recommend the yellow curry (though I don't think the color matters...they're all really savory and the spice level can be adjusted to your liking) and the fried, boneless catfish (either with curry paste or garlic pepper sauce). Eat that with a side of salad and some white rice and wash it down with some Singha, and you'll be golden.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can take a cab here from the Strip if you're visiting from out of town, or drive your own car here. The only problem is getting a cab back to your hotel or next destination. You may want to have the host arrange a ride back for you before you sit down to eat, otherwise, you may have to go out into Sahara Road and flag one down yourself or pray that you find one just emptied of passengers intent on coming here in the parking lot. That would be called \"Lotus luck\" or, winning the Lotus lottery."

The big bottle of course! \n\nThe food: \nGarlic Prawns...... The star of the show! This one is definitely all it is cracked up to be! If you go to Lotus of Siam, you MUST get the Garlic Prawns! I will come back for the prawns alone!\n\nCrispy Duck with Basil....... Delicious! Really good quality duck cooked perfectly, with a wonderful basil sauce that accented the dish without overwhelming the flavor of the duck!!!\n\nCrying Tiger.... I do have to say that though the flavors were good, the steak was over cooked! It was medium well almost well done.... we didn't finish the steak or take it home..... this one was disappointing!\n\nDrunken Noodles with chicken.... good... not great... flavors were good, but I ordered spicy 5 thinking this is my first time here and 5 would be spicy but safe.... no... not spicy at all... and for me, I need some spice with my thai noodles!\n\nAll around though, it was very good! Service is great! I will def be back!"

Service was so-so..but the food was great!\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- spicy chicken wings: DEEEELLISH! I think this was my bf's favorite. If you are in the mood for fried chicken wings, order this! It's fried wings covered in a sweet & spicy sauce so it's a bit sticky. These little things were just addicting and we loved every bite.\n\n- drunken noodles w/ seafood: yummy while it's hot! The first bite was amazing. I haven't had drunken noodles this good in awhile. It's more saucy than I'm used to but the flavor was all there. They didn't skimp out on the seafood either. Mussles, shrimp, scallop, & imitation crab [disappointed in the imitation crab but that's ok]. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the noodles stuck together after awhile so it got clumpy. Flavors were still good so I accepted it lol. \n\n- braised short rib w/ panang: this was interesting. Decided to order it because of its popularity among yelp reviews. On the pricey side [~$17].. but it's braised short rib so I get it. I don't know if this is the best combination for my taste buds but I can see it growing on me. It's still good don't get me wrong and I might order it again. I think I would have liked it if the short rib was more moist..I think it was more on the drier side which is why I can't give it a glowing review. Maybe it was an off day..but that's just what I thought about it. \n\nI will absolutely come back the next time I'm in vegas. It's a must-stop!!!"

Wouldn't go there unless you have a car because we walked all the way from Fashion mall and Sahara Ave does not look safe to be walking through at night. \n\nOrdered Prawn in a Blanket, Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab, House Special Fried Rice and Mango Sticky Rice. They were ALL delicious!! They gave a lot more prawns than I expected for the appetizer and they were pretty good size prawns too. The noodles were very tasty but they were sure spicy as hell even though we asked for MEDIUM spicy!! On a scale of 1-10 it was more of an 8 and our mouths were practically on fire with each bite! I'm not a whimp for spicy food since I eat them pretty often but this place makes me wonder how hot can it be if someone ordered \"very spicy\". Their dishes are very decent sizes so we were so full at the end. Even the dessert was pretty huge! \n\nAs for service, it was excellent! We got there at 6pm on a Monday and ordered a pretty expensive bottle of wine so not sure if that had any effect on the service we had. They were very attentive in terms of refilling the water and checking to see if everything was ok. In the end they even gave both of us a glass of dessert wine that was pretty good. My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas so far!"

I can say that all of my expectations were met. \n\nUpon arrival, we parked in a packed parking lot in a very unassuming shopping center. The restaurant is nestled in amongst other businesses so if you were just driving by, you'd never expect a James beard restaurant to be there. \n\nWe made reservations for 6pm on a holiday. So glad we did because when we arrived, the wait was about 10 people deep already. Highly recommend reservations!\n\nWe ordered the golden tofu and chicken satay as an app. Tofu was pillows of hot, fried goodness and the chicken satay was perfectly grilled and moist. Luckily the appetizers kept our tummies from screaming because the wait for our main dishes took much longer than I hoped (about 35 min).\n\nThe crispy duck curry was the main star of the meal even though they got the order wrong initially and sent us braised short ribs instead. Our server fixed the problem promptly. The northern larb was a second favorite. Pad see ewe was good, but nothing to write home about and their pineapple fried rice had more curry flavoring than I'd prefer. By the end of dinner, I was beyond stuffed and slightly disappointed that I didn't save room for dessert. \n\nOh well, there's always next time."

At 530 they opened doors and took ppl with reservations 1st. We were seated fast and received great service. \n\nWe went with yelp recs and got crispy duck in panang curry. It was amazing with perfect 8 spicy although very expensive.  We also ordered the soft shell crab with Drunken noodles which was pretty good but it was a small portion and expensive. Chicken wings weren't anything special. Garlic prawns were delish but again def expensive. Portions were small so we had to order 2 more items. Got the beef jerky which I personally didn't enjoy. I'm a sausage fiend so we got the sai oua which I felt was a little dry and missing something. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't wait for 2 hours for this place. Everyone raves about it and I agree the food is mostly delicious but the portions are way too small for the price.  Our bill was $113 before tip between 3 of us.

We looked over the giant menu, but settled on the lunch buffet since that's what the majority of people were eating (there were at least 10 people at the buffet the entire time we were there.)  It was cheap, both in terms of price and quality.  Nothing really stood out to me - I'm having a hard time remembering what I even found edible.  I wanted to like this place, but everything was pretty mediocre and forgettable.  Maybe if we'd ordered off the menu, my review would be different.

I did visit their ladies restroom and I was very surprised to see a fabulously clean and well groomed restroom. Soap, toilet paper..everything was stocked.

It is in a run down (understatement) strip mall and the inside isn't much better. We were seated in the room with the basement windows. \n\nThe buffet was the smallest I've ever seen - there were two chicken options, two soups, 2 noodle dishes and some vegetarian options. I tried a little bit of everything, but the only thing that stood out was the noodle soup. The orange chicken had an overpowering fake orange flavor and the pad thai was not good, nor were the egg rolls. That's too bad. \n\nMy friend ordered the drunken noodles, and they were good. Maybe ordering from their entree menu would have been a better decision? We split a bowl of coconut ice cream and I grabbed a few deep fried bananas off of the bar - the ice cream was super delicious, but the bananas were just okay.\n\nThe service wasn't that great. We had empty cups almost the entire meal (until it was time for the check, then we were given a refill.)\n\nI wasn't impressed and I'll probably just stick to eating in China Town."

There was a pomegranate tree growing outside my window on Gypsy Lane, and hummingbirds would fly up to feed at it. Air travel was wonderful in those days, so I would often take off for the weekend, to LA, SF, CO or NM. Nobody knew how amazing Lotus of Siam was, and it was my favorite place to eat.\n\nI moved back to NYC later that year, but I returned to Las Vegas in 2003 to get married. Having seen many other friends tie the knot since then, I will say this. Las Vegas weddings are the best. Don't just do a bachelor party. Make it one big party for everyone. No parents, no kids. Everyone arranges their own travel, and then block out some hotel rooms for your guests and have fun. \n\nNow that you have an idea of what I call romance, Lotus of Siam is a great date spot. It's been forever since I've been back to Vegas, but I recall this was tucked into a strip mall with a shooting range, a bail bonds, a pawn shop, a check cashing and a trashy lingerie shop. Basically, everything you want one stop shopping, even if you have to beg, borrow or steal, and why not go for the hat trick?\n\nWhy am I remembering them? Because that was a seriously awesome time. They opened a NY restaurant, had a falling out with their business partner, who tried to make it fancy, and I respect that they wanted more management control, though they're so old, it was too much for them, running two locations. I appreciate how passionately they feel about the food and their reputation. That also means long waits and big crowds, so I will fondly remember those halcyon days and that delicious Thai food."

The place is located in a dingy plaza however once you step inside you tend to forget the location. They have a huge glass wine cellar when you walk in and framed pictures hanging all over the walls of people who have eaten there. We were seated and serviced immediately, no wait. I asked the waiter what were popular dishes and he made recommendations,  mainly all under the \"Northern\" portion. I decided to order the Khao Soi with chicken and I'm glad I did. It was very delicious and had just the right spice to it. The chicken and noodles were cooked throughly and went perfect with the sauce. Only gripe is I wish it had more chicken and noodles because towards the end I had nothing but the sauce to eat however it was seasoned so good that I didn't mind slurping that alone. My friends ordered drunken noodles and thai tea and both of then said it was really good too. We ordered mango and sticky rice for dessert.  Although in our opinion it wasn't the best we had,  it was still good. As other reviews have mentioned, the portion size tends to be on the smaller side however we did not leave hungry either. We were still very satisfied and felt the price was quite reasonable for the quality.  This will definitely be a spot we hit up when we're in Vegas again. Next time I plan to order the crispy duck since it seems to be the most popular item to order."

However, we got seated at the bar and ordered our drinks first. Thai teas all around of course! Service is pretty darn good here, they sat us down and made sure we got our orders in quickly. Things I would recommend ordering:\n\n1) Crispy duck Penang curry (pricey at $24/dish) the skin is so crispy and the duck is cooked to perfection. I personally think the curry is too creamy but for those that love a coconut base curry, this is a must for you! \n2) Garlic prawns - gahhh damn it's good. They peel the skin but keep it semi attached to the meat of the shrimp so that you get the crunch of both. \n3) Veggie tom yum soup - the perfect combo of spicy and sour. \n4) Pad Thai - pretty good, but not their best dish. But I think it's cuz the other dishes I can't get else where as good! \n\nWish they would expand and bring this to SoCal! But this place is a must for every Vegas trip. Bill came out to be 85 including tip! Pretty good for the quality of food you get."

A friend and I decided to go out and had heard great reviews about Lotus of Siam. I Googled them, of course, to see what we were in for. I saw the words \"Extended Wine Selection\" and was immediately on board. The location is not the best in Vegas as the Commercial Center (yes, that is the actual name of the strip mall) has seen better days. Parking was plentiful and the restaurant was easy to find. Walking in, it seemed a little small until we entered the main dining room saddled by a giant wine cellar. The decor looked better suited for a mid 1990's country club, and was sort of all over the place, but not kitschy or themed which I appreciated. \n   The moment we were sat, waiters sort of came out of nowhere to bring us plates, water and cutlery. Extended wine selection is an understatement. The wine menu is larger than the food menu. I chose a cabernet on the lower end of the price scale as I am no Rockefeller and was pleased with it. Most impressive was the two wines that were ordered came in the appropriate glasses. One red and one white. (This is rare). \n   Once ordered, the food was brought to us very quickly. I ordered the Seafood Fried Rice and my friend ordered the Mint and Green Chili Beef (spiced at a level 9 out of 10). I was surprised at the serving size we were given for an entree priced just north of $10. I was full at the end of the meal with no appetizers or desserts. (Also rare). My friend, being more of a Thai food junkie than myself was satisfied that \"this place wasn't messing around\" when it came to spice. Apparently, many restaurants fall short in this department. The seafood tasted wonderful in the fried rice and included shrimp, crab, calamari and scallops. \n   The noise level was average, I didn't feel like everyone could hear our conversation, and try as I might, I couldn't eavesdrop on anyone else. The overall feel of the restaurant was unpretentious, relaxed and the service was consistent, yet unobtrusive. Toward the end of our meal, we were elated when the current Mayor of Las Vegas and his wife, the Mayor-Elect, were seated next to us and seemed to receive the exact same service level as everyone else. \n    Overall, I was pleased and will be returning many times in the future. A lot of reviews are right on the money when they say this is a hidden gem in the heart of Las Vegas."

We made reservations for dinner, so there was no waiting or anything like that.\n\nFood: The food is delicious. While I do appreciate my go-to, hole-in-the-wall Thai place, \"King and I\", down the street, I think that the quality of Lotus' food is much higher. Some of the dishes we had (we had a lot, so I don't remember the names of all of them), but red curry with duck, panang curry with tofu and chicken, drunken noodles with sea bass, papaya salad, glass noodles with chicken, crispy rice, and a couple other dishes I can't remember. All of them were delicious. My personal faves were the drunken noodles and panang curry. We also had dessert...mango with sweet sticky rice, and fried bananas with ice cream....yummm! We also had two bottles of wine. It was a LOT of food, and we only ended up paying about $45 bucks each between 6 girls...a pretty good deal, considering how much we ordered, and we were stuffed at the end.\n\nService: The waiter was very attentive. Plenty of refills without asking. \n\nDecor: Nothing fancy, but it has a nice ambiance, moreso than your typical hole-in-the-wall.\n\nLocation: It's kind of in a sketchy part of neighborhood, Sahara Ave and  Commercial Ctr. There are some other restaurants around, like a Korean bbq restaurant. \n\nIf you're looking for fantastic Thai food in the Vegas area, check this place out, you won't be disappointed. I'd come here more often if I didn't live on the opposite side of town!"

The strip mall it's in is sorta ghetto and depressing (tons of parking, though), but the restaurant itself is nice and quaint.  I heard that it's tough to get a table, so we got there about 10 mins before they opened on a Wednesday.  There were already two other people waiting for them to open, as well.  A steady stream of folks were filling up the seats as soon as they opened.  By the time we left, almost all the tables were full.\n\nThe food is good, but to be honest, didn't blow my mind.  I think all the hype set my expectations pretty high.  The food was still great, though.  We ordered the larb to start.  It was tasty, but there was definitely a lot more rice than meat.  We also got the crsipy prawns, which was my fave. They take the shrimp out of the shell, but still leave it connected, then they deep fry it, so you have one part fried shell and one part fried shrimp.  Really tasty.  We got the drunken noodles, too.  They were OK - was like a brothy pad see ew.  I was expecting a thicker sauce, but it felt more soupy than saucey.  We didn't order wine, but their wine cellar was HUGE and they had a bunch of awards on the wall for their wine list.\n\nThe service was AMAZING!  Extremely attentive, friendly and knowledgable.  They really made the experience great.  They also have a huge menu, so there's a lot of dishes to choose from.  \nOverall, I'm glad we went, just so we can say that we tried it.

It was Friday and still pretty busy, but as long as you don't have to wait, that's great.\n\nMy main focus at Lotus is their Northern Thai specialties. Besides these dishes, there are a lot of other Thai specialties that you don't typically find at other Thai restaurants in the valley. \n\nNam Kao Tod ($8.95): Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chili, ginger, peanuts and lime juice. Tasty salad mixture with great texture from the crispy rice. Love all the herbs and flavors.\n\nSai Oua ($11.95): Northern Thai-style spicy pork sausage. Served with ginger, red onion, chilies, and Napa cabbage. One of my all-time favorite sausages. I love the lemongrass especially. The sausage is great with all the fixings, too.\n\nNam Prik Ong ($11.95): Northern Thai red chili dip composed of ground pork, tomato, and spices; served with assorted vegetables and fried pork rinds. This dip will remind you of a meat sauce (you could totally create a pasta with it). It has a good depth of flavor and it's not heavy.\n\nThum Ka Noon ($10.95): Pounded and shredded young jackfruit salad with ground pork, tomato, and northern Thai spices and seasoning. Another delicious Northern Thai specialty. I enjoyed the flavors of this salad more than the Nam Kao Tod and Nam Prik Ong. Goes well with rice.\n\nCrispy Duck Panang ($27.95): Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. The duck is juicy and the skin is fantastically crispy. The panang is really great, too and definitely good with any choice of meat, but the crispy duck is the way to go!\n\nEverything is delicious and takes me back to my vacation in Chiang Mai. I'm definitely back for more specialties!"

The soup had chicken that was a little chewy, but was nicely spicy and piping hot-- though to be honest, I'm not sure why we ordered soup in 105 degree weather!\nOn to the entr\u00e9es, which were a mixed bag for me. I enjoyed the nuttiness and creaminess of the Penang Curry (paired nicely with tofu) as well as the Pad See Ew noodles. The sweetness from the palm sugar was noticeable in those dishes but were not overpowering. However, the Mee Krob crispy noodles tasted oddly chemical-like to me. I just could not eat them, and I think it was just the combination of spices and vegetables that created a strange odour and taste. The northern curry with (sparse) catfish was a little on the bland side for me and not quite what I'd expected. It was almost like soup; sauce was thin and did not hold up to the rice I drizzled it over.\nOverall, the food was good but nothing was outstanding.

Lotus of Siam is tucked away in a sketchy area, but the restaurant was just renovated and its actually nice inside (not fancy, but nicer than the standard hole in the wall asian restaurants). This place has the BEST THAI FOOD...EVER! Their specialty dish is the drunken noodle sea bass (must try this!). The catfish is amazing too! (Warning: for you non asian readers, the fish comes with head attached, but you can ask them to not serve it with the head) When you order food from there you have a choice from a scale of 1 to 10 on how spicy you want your dish to be. I'm kind of a wuss and only get level 3, but I still have to have the thai ice tea to cool my mouth down. This time, I ordered the chicken panang curry (level 3) and it was the perfect amount of spicy. Curry is so good for you, so I try to eat it when I can.\n\nwww.anitaeat.com"

The flavours, and textures, of this appetizer and everything else I tried (the \"chicken wings\" are unlike anything you've had anywhere: deep fried until crispy then sauteed with chili, garlic, and topped with crispy mint leaves.)

The Pad Prik King is one of the best things I've ever ate. It is a small portion for the price but it is worth it. The Nam Prik Ong is almost the same thing but more of an entree and equally delicious. Crispy Duck Panag was not good. I love duck but the cognac sauce was overpowering. The wine was perfect. Restaurant has a comfy vibe, perfect for dates. The lighting is bright and there is just enough noise to be able to hear the person across from you. Service was good too.

The menu is large but perhaps the most noteworthy dishes are the distinctive Northern Thai options. I never miss the Tom Kha soup, Nam Kao Tod, Garlic Prawns, Khao Soi. Enjoy a Thai Tea or a very refreshigng Tsing Ha to drink, not to mention the excellent wine list.\nThere is often a wait but that speaks for itself. When locals to wait to eat somewhere, there's a reason. Much has been written about this humble location and it's award winning chef, Saipin Chutima, and the hype is real. Service has generally been quite good, sometimes slow, and yes without reservations you can wait awhile for a table. However, they also offer take out so you can happily place an order and simply pick up your food which I do often."

It's in a strip mall, there was a bunch of broken window glass in the parking lot, and it felt kinda seedy.  But, the food.  Oh, the food.  I'd read that Gourmet magazine called it the best Thai restaurant in America, and I had sky-high expectations.\n\nThey were exceeded.\n\nThere's a neat twist, too.  In addition to all the dishes you think of as \"Thai\" (which are from the southern part of Thailand), they have a whole set of Northern Thai specialities.  If you think you know Thai food, only order from the part of the menu with the northern specialties.  It's Thai, but it's nothing you'll recognize unless you're really well traveled and know Thai food extremely well.\n\nEat. Here. Now.  If you say you don't like Thai food, eat here anyway.

Having said that, usually we'll order 4 or 5 dishes and chow down, it seems that all the chefs there aren't exactly cooking the same meals consistently.  We'll LOVE a dish one night, try it again on the next visit and ... well... just isn't the same.  It's still good, just not mind-blowing *shruggs* can't win them all.\n\nIf you know you are planning on trying here, MAKE RESERVATIONS, if you are trying to get in last minute at dinner time, try showing up 15/20/30min before they open.  The line usually will already be forming at the time but I've had good luck getting in that way.  \n\nBest of luck to you and hopefully you enjoy!"

The waitress had a real attitude and did't seem to want to be bothered with us. We are not overly familliar with Thai food and had many questions. The waitress didn't really seem to want to be botered. The foods we ordered were marginal at best. Just not a real pleasant experience. Will go elsewhere next time.

Perfectly crispy and garlicky but consistently a little on the salty side for my taste. However, the flavor is so good that I can't complain. \n\nThe crispy duck panang curry is also very good. You could adjust the spiciness level (up to 10) and warning- their spicy is SPICY!! \n\nI wouldn't get some of the dishes you could order at normal thai restaurants.

The 5 other people I dined with are American and i'm British. I don't know if the U.S. is lacking in good Thai restaurants but this place for me was just 'good' despite previously being told by my American friends that this place is amazing/delicious/fantastic...\n\nHalf of us ordered chicken pad thai and the other half of us ordered green or yellow chicken thai curry. We had soup and spring rolls for starters. The food in my opinion was tasty, but nothing that excited my taste buds. The sauce for the curry was a little watery in my opinion and the spring rolls lacked in flavour. If I could give this restaurant 3.5 out of 5 I would as i'm teetering between giving 3 or 4 stars. The service was just ok, not as attentive as they could have been but not impossibly slow. I had a lovely evening but that was mainly more due to the company than the food. I do have to say though that the portions are very generously sized and the prices are reasonable. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back here next time i'm in Vegas as cab fare is about $25 each way, not too bad if there's a group of you but if there's only you and one other then maybe not. I would only return IF I or someone I was travelling with had a strong craving for Thai food when in Vegas but other than that, I live in the North of England and there are tonnes of Thai restaurants in our city centres of Leeds & Manchester of which i've ate at many of them and have had much better Thai food back home in the U.K. This isn't the worst Thai restaurant i've been to, it's just okay/nice/pleasant.. nothing outstanding."

So when I came across Lotus of Siam, I naturally thought it was a massage parlor with happy endings. After all, the lotus is the universal Asian code word for vajajay. I quote from an ancient Thai love poem - \"She laid back with her beauty spread before me like a lotus blossoming, ready to capture the dew\". Who woulda thought that Thai poets wrote in English back then!  But after reading the reviews I was aroused in a different way.( Now the term sexual appetite makes sense) and I had to go (or come, depending on your perspective).\n\nSo far of all the Thai places that I have been to, Lotus of Siam has had the best food of all.  I was pretty amazed at the wine selection available for a Thai restaurant.  Who thinks about varietals from Chateauneuf du Paupe in a Thai place?  But they have it here!  Service was unusually good for an Asian place.\n\nTom Yum Kai and Tom kha kai was the best I ever had anywhere.  Nice acidity and creaminess of coconut was spot on.  Braised short rib with panaang was ultra tender and wonderfully flavored.  A fantastic idea for that curry.  Fried sea bass on top drunken noodles was also very good.  very tender with a nice crisp saltiness.  I'm not sure if my taste buds were a bit off that day, but the food seemed a bit on the salty side, but not overwhelmingly so.  Spice levels tend to be on the higher end, so I would order a notch or two down from what you normally get at other Thai places.\n\nGourmet magazine (before its closure) touted this as the best Thai food in America -  a pretty bold claim, but I can't find reason to argue.\n\nIf you can't get your spice on here, there is always the Green Door just across, so you can get your kinky on (or so I've heard).\n\nI end with a famous Thai adage - Beware of who you lay with because you may be struck with the fiery burn of Thai chili in your head that has no mouth.\n\nbest thing - tom kha kai and braised short rib with panang"

I was encouraged by the likes of Ryan D. and new acquaintances at Khoury's to give the \"best\" Thai restaurant in Vegas another chance.  So I made my third visit.  Today, Lotus redeemed a star.  However, I am sorry to say that its still overrated and I doubt I will return for a fourth visit.  We had the roast duck curry, the green curry with beef, and the pad see ew.\n\nMy favorite was the roast duck curry.  This is the dish that has inspired other restaurants like Thai BBQ and Stick E Rice to make the Americanized red curry with cherry tomatoes, grapes, and pineapples.  I think they both do it better.  The curry was sweet, but had some flavor to back it up.  The portion was ridiculously small, and the duck meat, while good quality, was skimpy.  This is an above average, Americanized duck curry that I guess I would recommend if you aren't familiar with authentic Thai food.\n\nNext up was the pad see ew with pork.  The pork was a bit tough, but nothing to complain about.  What little Chinese broccoli there was in this dish, wasn't rotten this time, so that was a plus.  This is a very saucy pad see ew, and sweetened.  Good for the general public, I suppose.  Not a bad dish, but I prefer a drier pad see ew.  You can get a much better version of this next door at Komol with huge portions of fresh Chinese broccoli.\n\nAnd on to today's joke, the green curry.  This is one of the weaker green curries I have had. The beef was a little on the tough side.  There was potential with well balanced and interesting spices in the curry, but the curry itself lacked any real backbone or character.  It was quite watery in taste.  I had to add chili powder to make it enjoyable.  If you are a fan of green curry, you might want to skip this one.  Again, the portion was small.  \n\nAs with most Americanized Thai restaurants, don't be afraid to order really spicy to have a bit of heat.  I could eat a 10 here and not break a sweat.\n\nLoS gains a star for not having rotten Chinese broccoli, and taking that terrible Northern Red Curry off of their new menu.  Unfortunately, this place is still on the bottom of my list as far as Thai restaurants in Vegas go."

Located in a dilapidated old strip mall north of the main strip, you'd easily miss this place if you sneezed but make no mistake, this place is the real deal folks! At check in, we were told it would be a grueling 45 minute wait. We were then invited to the bar to pass the time.  Needless to say, we enjoyed a shot or two at the bar and made some new friends in some cool gals.  Before we knew it, our table was ready! Way less than 45 minutes I might add.\n\nOur server was kind courteous and very helpful. She took our orders and within moments, our tasty dishes were basking on our table.\n\nSea bass drunken noodles - if you like chow fun, you will enjoy every bite of this phenomenal dish! Order it medium spicy and top it with the buttery sea bass and you'll be good to go! Satisfaction guaranteed!\n\nCrispy duck - served with a coconut panang curry sauce, I was blown away by the incredible texture and zesty tang of the panang curry, awesomely delicious!\n\nGarlic prawns - jumbo prawns served nice and crispy with the most enticing aroma I've experienced in years. It will make you drool at first whiff and the explosive garlicky flavor will keep you pining for another decadent bite!\n\nOverall, awesome service, impeccable food and good times = A+++ from this guy \n\nHappy Eats!"

Then my cousin suggested eating at one of his MUST EAT AT restaurants in Vegas, Lotus of Siam!\n\nWe just got to the restaurant just in time before closing for dinner service. The hostess sat us quickly and hand us our menus. I wanted to try some of their popular menu items, but I had to hold back on them. Since it was the season of Lent, I had to avoid beef, pork, and fowl foods. Being in the city of sin, I decided to be good on a Friday. It was a hard decision for me, but I went with the pad see-ew.\n\nOur entrees were served withing a couple minutes. The pad see-ew was composed of stir-fried wide rice noodles, eggs, and Chinese broccoli all mixed with black soy sauce. Although the pad see-ew had egg in it, it was one item that I could have while observing Lent. The noodles were nice and chewy. The Chinese broccoli was crispy and fresh. The egg was in the scrambled form, but added the protein element to the dish. To complete the melody of the dish, the black soy sauce gave the right amount of saltiness. Just like one of my favorite dishes, Chow fun, I really did enjoy this dish.\n\nI do need to come back again and try the other popular dishes when in Vegas and not observing Lent."

I would like to thank you by telling me about Lotus of Siam. \n\nI have to say the location is kinda hidden. I had a hard time finding it with my GPS. It is in a stip mall that looks run down. I would never think that such a place would be so popular. \n\nI came here with Kim D.  I was so happy to see lemon grass drink on the menu. I have looked at all of the dinning places in the Bay Area and have not ever seen it on the Menu.\n\n I tried it once when I was on a trip to Thialand.  I remered to being sweeter with a fuller taste to it.  The one at Lotus of Saim brought me back to Thailand. It is not as sweet and taste as if there has been more water added to the drink. That being said it was still good.\n\nWe had also odered a soup it was sweet and sour with chicken and coconut. It was the best soup I have ever had. Notes of lemon and coconut rang out. A dance that came together. I wish I could bring it home. \n\nWe had also odered the Pad Thai with shrimp and eggs whites only. the pad thai was only oki. \n\nthe last dish was Larb with pork. It was only oki as well."

Cashew nut chicken was excellent Curry Panang wonderful  and last but not least the Tom Ka Kai is my favorite!!  I always order medium spicy on everything when eating  Thai but Beware of the level of Hot/spicy  you ask for with the Panang  because the 5 really  got my attention..  Pad se ewe is great also!  The only downfall is no brown rice here and the wait for your food if its crowded.

We came 10-min after it opened on a Saturday night, and already there was an hour wait.  We debated if we should stay, but since it was still pretty early we decided to wait it out.  Tip #1 - Don't be like us.  Make a RESERVATION.\n\nIn the waiting area, there are laminated articles and accolades plastered from wall-to-wall.  They've won so many James Beard awards, and have been named THE best Thai restaurant in the country.  High praise!\n\nWe only wished that we came with a large group of people so we could try more dishes, but since we had an hour to kill we had plenty of time to decide what to get.   It took us forever to settle on a few dishes because everything on the menu sounded delicious!  I would recommend trying stuff that's from Issan, Northern Thailand, or Chef's choice because c'mon... you can get Pad See Ew and Pad Thai anywhere.   \n\nThis is what we ordered:\n-  A cup of Tom Yum Koong soup\n-  A cup of Tom Kah Kai soup\n-  Shrimp in a blanket (shrimp wrapped with bacon and wonton wrappers then deep fried).  \n-  Crispy duck with Panang Curry\n-  Soft Shell Crab with Drunken Noodles\n\nEverything was DELICIOUS.  My favorites were the soups and soft shell crab with drunken noodles.  The depth of flavor they were able to infuse into the soups really made them memorable.  You could taste all the wonderful flavors of Thailand in those little cups - lemongrass, lime, chili, etc.  Mmm... \n\nThe soft shell crab was perfectly fried and layered beautifully atop the flat noodles (like the ones they use for Pad See Ew).  There were so many popping flavors that the dish still danced on my tongue hours after we had eaten.  I highly recommend this dish!\n\nI was least impressed by the Crispy Duck Panang Curry even though it was still good.  I think I like really unique, bold flavors and the red panang curry tasted pretty similar to other Thai places.  The deep fried duck was good, but nothing beats Chinese peking duck - I couldn't help but compare.\n\nCan't wait to come back again.  This place is a must try for those who enjoy Thai food!"

No hard liquor; and 3) make a reservation.  We called on our way into Vegas for the next day, so don't be scared off by this fact.  Just call, take the late night reservation time, and enjoy the food. \n\nStarted with fried wontons, which honestly were tasty but nothing new or interesting or astonishing.  Then, had the beef with peppercorn, which is a ton of little peppercorns on the vine (?) which surprised me; but this was delicious.  Never had something like this before!  Also, tasted the garlic prawns.  All the talk on yelp, so I'll leave that to the serious seafood eaters. \n\nGiant parking lot, so that's one less thing to worry about.

            "review": "It's been, oh 5 years since I've step foot in Lotus of Siam. I had the lunch buffet and remember not being super impressed. So when my boss said we were going to Lotus of Siam for dinner, I was a bit confused. He said the food was amazing, and it turned out he was right. Unfortunately, the service was pretty terrible, so I won't be running back.\n\nWe had a \"reservation\" yet had to wait 10-15 minutes to get our table. With it being 110 degrees outside, that sucked. Once seated, it was another 20 minutes before we could order, and only because we pretty much tackled an employee to take our order. The ordering process was very rude, as we seemed rushed and weren't helped by any recommendations as we had asked for.\n\nWe were brought three different plates that weren't ours. We had ordered so much food we didn't know what was ours and what wasn't, and the staff kind of scolded us for beginning to eat a plate that was set on our table. Get your act together, guys!\n\nAs I said, the food was all pretty amazing. That's the only thing saving this from being a 2* review. Everything they put in front of us was delicious. I really don't remember a bad dish.\n\nWhen all was said and done, we were left with a $50 per person bill, which seemed like a lot for the style of restaurant we were in."

This place is, in street term, \"proper!\"  Yea, I'm hood like that.\n\nI love watching the expression of my friends' faces when they take their first bite of the Braised Short Ribs with Panang.  Their eyes always light up, and to me that's enough because I'd like to think they're saying, \"Thank you.\"  \n\nLOS knows how to do curry really well.  I still think it's kind of weird that their The Crispy Duck with Chu-Chee and Panang taste the same to me.  I tried them side by side too. Maybe my palate was inflamed from the heat of all the other dishes.  \"Shoot for a level 7 next time, Chowder.\"  It's still good though, but i would prefer the Braised short ribs over the ducks.\n\nMy latest craving is their Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  It's deep fried sea bass  top with chili and basil over a pan of fried flat noodles.  Very similar to Chinese Chow Fun. The sea bass is always fresh and hearty.  Heavenly! \n\nPortions here are a tad smaller, but you're getting more refined ingredients for what you're paying for.  \n\nVerdict: Make reservations in advance!"

But I'm glad that we went, it's definitely a diamond in the rough. It's a causal place with a menu, much like other Thai places, thick as a novel. There was only two of us so we couldn't order that many things but everything was great. I think the highlight was their insane wine selection. And I didn't get a chance to really look but it must of been decent prices b/c the table next to us was ordering bottles of Cakebread, like it was soda or something. Our waitress recommended a glass of Sauvignon Blanc that we both enjoyed. \n\nFood: \nSea Bass in ginger sauce- not the whole seabass that some Thai places give, but I think I like it better this way.\nShrimp Pad Thai- the other fattie I was with, seemed to like this dish alot. Kept ranting and raving about it being the best Pad Thai since being in Thailand. I guess there's some credibility to Chef P's statements\nGreen curry- loved it, nice and spicy. But could probably get that at any Thai place in LA. \n\nNext Vegas trip, will def make it a point to go back and try some other things and hopefully with a group of people so that we can order more dishes and this time get some bottles of wine!!!"

            "review": "Everyone who frequents restaurants has what I like to call a \"benchmark\" dish.  At an Italian spot it might be Pizza Margherita or Veal Parmigiana, For French food it might be Moules Frites or the Torchon of Foie Gras.  It's the dish that, if prepared properly, signals that the cuisine is up to par.  When trying to ascertain whether the full range of offerings is worth exploring it must first be determined that the kitchen can get the basics right.\n\nMy benchmark dish for any Thai restaurant is Tom Kha Kai, a magical combination of chicken, chicken broth, coconut cream, galanga, fish sauce, mushrooms, lime juice, and chili oil.  Ingredients may vary from spot to spot, as they often will, but the overall composition is pretty consistent.  The rub, as I have experienced it, is in getting the balance right.  Some places have too much coconut cream, others offer just a hint of chili oil (or omit it completely.)  I've had it with all kinds of mushrooms, and sometimes with huge chunks of galanga, and sometimes with none at all.  For one as obsessed as I, it grows a little tiresome.\n\nI have had Tom Kha Kai at countless restaurants in the Southland, and am still looking for one that is as perfectly put together as what they serve at Lotus of Siam, the celebrated industrial park oddity way off the strip in Las Vegas.  Everything is in perfect balance and when I that first spoonful slides down my gullet I almost tear up a little.  Seriously.  It's just that feeling one encounters when something is SO right.. there's a magic to it.\n\nThe rest of the menu can be a little hit-or-miss, as others have noted.  But there is so much on the menu that is off-the-charts terrific that it hardly seems to merit de-starring.\n\nSo five stars for the crispy duck with spicy mint leaves.  Five stars for the Nam Kao Todd, crispy rice with minced sour sausage.  Five stars for the spicy beef salad.  So what if the Panag curry is a little lifeless?  There is certainly no shortage of items on this menu that make my head spin with delight.\n\nAnd no, the decor is nothing to write home about.  I couldn't care less because the service is always so friendly and accommodating.  My blinders go on at Lotus and when I have an array of tasty treats in front of me I can't even SEE the decor.  Love really is blind, I guess.\n\nAnd eleventy-billion stars for the wine list.  Jeez LOUISE the wine list.  Nothing, NOTHING goes better with spicy Thai cuisine than a cold bottle of Reisling and Lotus of Siam has scads of them.  Rare and highly rated selections at rock-bottom prices.  Donhoff.  J.J. Prum.  Zind-Humbrecht.  All the heavy hitters are represented, and there are plenty of Goldkapsels at near-release prices. Achtung! A perfect match for every dish can be found here along with a staff that can guide you through the polysyllabic minefield that one encounters with all things Germanic.\n\nStay away from the buffet.  Make a point of ordering some Northern dishes.  ABSOLUTELY order a bowl of the Tom Kha.  When visiting at night be sure to make a reservation and DEFINITELY arrange with your cab driver to pick you up after your meal because the parking lot gets a little bit sketchy after dark.  But for me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a visit to Lotus.  It's a can't-miss."

We arrived during dinner rush, but honestly they're probably busy at any hour since it's been featured on Food Network, among other places. It is handy that they had iPads set up to where they can text you when they're ready to seat your party. There is also a bar area and a waiting room so you don't have to wait outside. Before dinner, we grabbed beers and Thai tea to drink in the waiting room while being able to sit and relax inside. They have photos of celebrities from movie stars to Food Network shows all over their walls, and the owner of the restaurant which was also the chef, popularly walked around to tables with which seemed to be many regulars praising him and greeting him. Our table was ready and we ordered the prawns which seemed to be most popular on all of the tables, and a duck noodle. Mind you, I'm not a fan of duck but it was crisp and fried to perfection in the most perfect sauce. The prawns were huge and flavorful. We also had a steak dish that came with a small sauce that is to die for. What had me was that they offer the Laos papaya salad that not many other places do. We ordered a spice level of 10 and we were dying but it was literally perfection. Everything was extremely good. I was disappointed to find out that they were out of mango sticky rice, so we settled for a fried banana and ice cream, which tasted similar to Filipino banana lumpia, but they were cut up into small pieces for an easier family style and small portioning.

It was so good that it put me in a four hour food coma that left me missing all the activities on my last night in Sin City -- no regrets.\n\nI highly recommend reservations since the line was hopping before it was even open. We were lucky enough to snag a last minute reservation and got to skip the long line of hot and hungry patrons outside. The decor here is warm and homey -- like every family owned Thai restaurant you would fine in your favorite suburban strip mall in Anywhere, America. Lotus of Siam specializes in Isan food which is pretty similar to the Laotian/Cambodian food I've had in the past meaning it was extra, extra delicious!\n\nMy best friend and I shared:\n+ Garlic Prawns: The prawns are cut to look like the shell has molted off the flesh and then deep fried. Disgusting yes, but also very yummy and crunchy! As the menu said -- it's like potato chips! This hearty portion was on almost every table in the joint and for good reason too.\n+ Panang Crispy Duck: Lotus of Siam does the deep fried game very well and this duck did not disappoint. I'm usually wary of duck curries because they can be very gamey but that was not the case at all -- this was recommended to us by our server since the bbq hen was not available and ended up being one of our favorite things on the menu!\n+ Khao Soi - Burmese Egg Noodles in curry sauce. A unique dish that I have not seen on any other Thai menu near my house so we had to get this! It's super runny but totally worth the mess.\n+ Nam Kao Tod: Crispy Rice Salad very similar to a Laotian dish I'm obsessed with. It was spicy and crunchy and full of different herbs and flavors! I recommend asking for extra lettuce to scoop this up since the cabbage they gave us was quite small and do not do the job right.\n\nI would skip eggrolls or dumplings -- they are bland and not worth the space in your tummy.\n\nI'll definitely be hitting this place up the next time I'm in Vegas.

I haven't been to many Thai places so I can't make that statement, but I know it's definitely some of the best food in Vegas.  \n\nI've been a number of times, both pre and post expansion.  If you haven't been there in over a year then note that they've expanded and have taken over what I think is part of the wig shop (yes, wig shop) next door.  Like a lot of good places in Vegas, it's in a strip mall and if you didn't know it was there you would never see it because it's not facing the road.  The strip mall itself is a bit old and run down, and the exterior of the place is not impressive.  The entryway of Lotus, even, is tiny and cramped.  Their \"waiting area\" has space for about 4 or 5 people and that's it.  Once you get inside, though, things look decent.\n\nIf you go at night or on a weekend expect a bit of a wait if you haven't called ahead for a reservation -- don't worry though, no fancy wear is necessary, a t-shirt and shorts would be fine.  Normally you can just walk right in and get seated immediately.\n\nEvery time I've been the staff has been helpful, courteous, and attentive.  They do a lunch buffet which I thought looked rather pedestrian the couple of times I've been there during lunch, but honestly you should actually sit down and order a real dish or two rather than pick from the buffet unless you happen to work near Lotus of Siam and go there frequently for lunch.\n\nThe menu is absolutely huge, with maybe up to 200 items on it, and they offer both northern and southern Thai dishes, not that I would necessarily notice the difference.  The prices are usually around $10 per dish, and they have a wide selection of wines since they've expanded if that's your thing.  \n\nThe chicken satay is a good classic appetizer that's done well and served with the usual peanut sauce and a small vegetable salad.  I've also had some garlic & pepper chicken wings which is probably the only thing I've had that I've not been overly impressed with.  They were a bit too dry to me.\n\nAs far as dishes go, I had the moo yang (grilled pork with a very nice savory dipping sauce) once and thought that was pretty good.  The next time I got the chicken panang curry and that has become my usual order.  The quality of the ingredients is top notch and the portions are large.  Every person I've ever taken here has been very impressed.  \n\nAs a side note, if you do drop by Lotus of Siam when they are packed and you don't have a reservation, just go to the adjacent restaurant, Namaste, which has some extremely good and similarly priced Indian food."

We had that dish and were blown away, noting that we had never had anything quite like it. We sampled a number of dishes--all of them superb.

This was dubbed as The Best Thai Restaurant in America (even the concierge at The Palazzo raved about this place) by Food Network, but alas! FN has failed me again. \n\nFirst, it's in a seedy area in Vegas.  Second, for a very 'famous' place, the waiting area barely fit 6 people.  It's hot in Vegas! Waiting outside feels like waiting in an oven.  Third, everything is wayyyy overpriced.  $25 for 4 pieces of mid-sized prawns.  Those prawns tasted superb but geez! 4 pieces?  Fourth, the service is mediocre.  They took forever to acknowledge us after we sat down and for drink refills.  \n\nOther than the crispy fried prawns, the rest of our meal were just ok.  We ordered Pad Thai with shrimp& chicken (this is how we test new Thai restos we try, if you can't do this impressively then you fail as a Thai resto), Thai fried rice, and two other dishes I don't even remember (one was fish and the other was saut\u00e9ed seafood with vegetables).  Our bill totaled way over $150.  $150 for 'just ok' is unacceptable.  \n\nCompared to our fave Thai resto in San Francisco, this place is no match.  Like I said, I really wanted to like this place but as much as the chefs in FN and the concierge raved about it, it's just not that impressive.   \n\nThe two stars is just for the crispy garlic prawns!"

Duh, right?\n\nNam Kao Tod - I never had deep fried that wasn't burned, but they had it. It was the most memorable dish that we had out of the five we ordered. \n\nSea Bass Drunken Noodles - quite good\n\nReminder: Their version of spicy is not the same as yours. Be careful when ordering.\n\nThe reason I'm rating them with 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food (while good) wasn't memorable enough for us. The service was also laid back, especially when we weren't knowledgeable with the food. If you need someone to refill your water (AND YOU WILL), you will have stand up and wave them down in order to get their attention.\n\nI can't say that the GF and I will be back, but it probably was the best Thai I've had.

I like smaller friendlier atmospheres and a relaxed ambiance with fantastic food at reasonable prices without the pretense thats usually displayed at a lot of sub par casino restaurants. I really like the house special flat noodles with crawfish. Their wine list is fantastic and much more reasonably priced than other places that boast great wine lists. Alas, the beer is limited to the standard weak Asian lagers and domestics, but if its fantastic beers I want I just go to the Himalayan Cuisine instead. The sommelier here is a very affable man and after chatting him up I was able to twist his arm and offer him a little taster of the Bergstrom Pinot Noir I had one night. All in all, fantastic Thai food that deserves its well-reviewed reputation, great wine list, friendly wait-staff that doesn't stand on ceremony, bland beer selection and decent but not necessarily fantastic lunch buffet."

So, make reservation.\n\nWe ordered the special crispy duck with panang curry sauce, Thai fried rice, chilli mint catfish, ground pork, chicken curry, and stuffed chicken wings.\n\nThe crispy duck is really really delicious! It is a must try! We did pay $20+ for 6/7 small slices of duck meat tho. \n\nThe spicy chilli catfish was just ok.  It cost us $15 for literally 5/6 small pieces of fish.  The chilli mint ground pork tasted good but the serving portion was so small that we were almost upset.  Seriously, ground pork costs nothing.  Fried rice was good but nothing special.\n\nWe did have the sticky rice and mango dessert.  It is to die for.\n\nOverall, food is decent but prices are not acceptable for Thai food.  I would suggest you go for the Chef's specials such as the crispy duck and beef stew.  They are all over $20 a dish but at least they are special.  Don't order the typical Thai food that you can get it somewhere else at a much cheaper price.\n\nWe probably won't go back because all we really did was loading up on steam rice so we didn't have to leave hungry."

Everything is good; I have yet to try anything \"bad\" here. The portions are decently sized, the flavour is full on. I suggest ordering things on the less spicy side of the spectrum so you can add spice to it once it's served. Got overzealous and ordered a 6 on the spicy scale. Was a little too much!\n\n2. THE WINE LIST: Last thing I would have anticipated is a good wine list at a Thai restaurant in a strip mall in Las Vegas. BUT, this place blows it out of the water with their wine list! Definitely ask a server for pairing recommendations for your order.\n\n3. THE PRICING: IMO, their pricing is very fair for the quality and quantity of the food that you get. Order away, good sir!\n\nThe negatives are a little bit out of the restaurants control, but still something to take into consideration:\n\n1. LOCATION: The restaurant is located in a rather dark strip mall that is closed off from major streets. Don't be too worried, but keep your wits about you. Have been here a dozen times without incident, and haven't heard of any issues. Just looks a little...shady.\n\n2. SPEED OF SERVICE: Sometimes the restaurant is so packed, service is a little slow...too slow for my taste. BUT the food outweighs the negative for me, so I deal with it.\n\n3. LENGTH OF TIME TO GET SEATED: Be prepared for a wait! Sometimes you can wait here for up to an hour. Yes, it's that good.\n\n\n\n\nWould I recommend this place to others? Absolutely.\n\nWould I come back here myself? Thinking about going again tonight now that I've written this review!!!"

And I would gladly move to Thailand in a heartbeat if it weren't the sauna sweatbox of tropical equator hell, where  I'd look like a tool that had taken a shower in my clothes pretty much whenever I walked outside....  not pretty.  So as a consolation, I've been terribly fortunate to have the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. right in my own back yard, (well, ten miles away but whatever) within the first week of moving here, I had my first experience at Lotus of Siam and my world has never been the same since.  \n\nAnd what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times).  In a rundown shopping center east of the Strip, Chef Saipin creates some the loveliest, humble yet sophisticated dishes that make up for the lack of ambience.\n\nNow please, please do not be disparaged by the desolate location and crappy shopping center facade; yes, it is dilapidated and no, your car will not get jacked (many a friend have periodically checked to see if their car's still there) no worries, the homeless keep an eye out for ya!  They've even told me I had a brake light out, which deserved a buck...good people, those cracky addicts...\n\nAs you enter through what I can only imagine is akin to walking through the entryway of a Western Union in Compton, you've suddenly matrixed into a crowded, tiny vestibule that is indicative of the original size of the restaurant.  In fact it's recently gone trough an expansion, and when you've managed to squeeze past the herd, the room on the right is the expansion, while directly in front of you is the original dining room.  And the interior, although updated, has the exact the same finishes: green carpeting dark, mahogany wood chair rails, brass railings and oddly scaled glass drop chandeliers....it's like a time machine into retro...without the chic... which I have grown to absolutely love, like visiting grandma's house in the not so nice neighborhood during the Holidays.\n\nApart from your typical Thai Apps, (Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Chicken Wings)  The Moo Dad Deaw is an awesome starter, akin to a Bar snack item, to be eaten with a nice cold beer.  These succulent, juicy, tender pieces of pork are the precursor to chicken fingers, you can easily pop these suckers one after one in your mouth; as a good accompaniment, have some Sticky Rice to go with it; go ahead wreck your diet, you weren't serious about those New Year's resolutions anyways...\n\nMy favorite curry dish on the menu, which isn't you normal curry dish:  the Braised Short Rib with Penang Curry - this luxurious dish has all the depth and richness laid into it's protein not usually paired with Thai cuisine but definitely makes sense.  The hearty Short Rib goes so well with Penang, which is so good, Chef Saipin add Cognac into the Curry which elevates it to whole different level.  I bypass all the other curries cuz I know this one has the best flavor profile out of all of them.\n\nLotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!  First, the Noodles have that perfect texture; mochi chewiness but firm enough to achieve maximum noodle satisfaction.  Combine it with the Egg, Beef, Broccoli and sweet Soy, it's such an addictive dish that's light yet savory with just a hint of Black Pepper to tighten the palate...just yum.\n\nAnother all time favorite of mine:  Crab Fried Rice.  The way that Lotus makes this dish is pretty unbelievable, the rice is incredibly fluffy with a light infusion of crab broth.  I love finding morsels of Crab and Egg as if it's a treasure hunt and there's always a big hunk of Tomato wedge that's seems so out of scale with everything else that's on the plate.  But, as I've ordered this dish consecutively on numerous occasions, it's become a endearing and integral component that adds acidity to an otherwise aromatic, subtle dish.  It is a must-get item on the menu, but be warned, it's not an all out powerhouse of strong flavors, so you may want to order it as an earlier course before the heavier dishes arrive to your table. \n\nAs dining experiences go, it's all over the place except for the food.  And in the end, with moderate prices, I can't really say that anything else affect the fact that Lotus has the best Thai food I've ever had.  \n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\nFood:          5+++\nAmbience:  2 (much improved hole in the wall)\nService:       4.75 (they're always so busy, it can't be helped)"

The Tom Yum Kai hot and sour soup with chicken, lime juice, lemon grass and straw mushrooms is spectacular and consistent in quality.\n\nSeveral years ago Lotus did a large expansion,  started catering to tour buses, and in my opinion, at the expense of small groups and locals.  That change has resulted in service screw ups, including forgetting parts of an order several times, being served the wrong entree,  unusually long waits for the arrival of food and at times wait staff that was non-communicative at their best and outright rude at their worst.\n\nCombine the above with the inability to make reservations online or by phone prior to their opening time each day, the inability to get anything but a busy signal once they open, and the mass feeding frenzy created by bus arrivals that has lowered the ambience from mediocre (hey, for years it's been about the food in spite of the mediocre ambience) to an ambience somewhere between an Army mess hall and a bus station waiting room, I've given up on going to Lotus.  When they're good they're really really good and when they are bad they are terrible.  In the past two years they have typically been close to or at terrible.\n\nOne way to enjoy the typically outstanding food is to order carryout.  I was uncertain the first time because I didn't know how well cooked fish would taste after a 20-minute car ride, but the answer is that is was excellent....excellent enough that we've used the carryout process several times recently."

The sauce is perfectly spectacular and they make it just as spicy as you want which for me is \"tears in your eyes, flames in your mouth hot\" :) .  The chicken quality is great -- fresh and perfect.  The service is great -- the staff were very attentive and nice.

He even discouraged us from ordering the Thai salad because he said the dressing might have been made with it as well.  \nMSG certainly enhances the flavor of food.

We had to wait about 35 minutes for a table of 2. We were told by the waitress that the buffet was closing in 25 minutes so we could order that or order off the menu. We chose to order off the menu.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer and two items off the Chefs Choice.\nFor drinks we got a Thai beer - Singha and then a Thai Iced team - which tasted like candy.\n\n\nOur appetizer was  GARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - the wings were big and fried perfectly well. The garlic was definitely in full force but really yummy.\n\nEntrees included: GARLIC PRAWNS - which were really fantastic. Cooked perfectly and seasoned very nicely. The prawns came on top a small bed of lettuce, carrots, cilantro and a delicious sauce. This would be a great appetizer even for the table if you had a party of 4.\n\nand\n\nKHAO SOI BRAISED SHORT RIB - this was really great. the short rib was incredibly tender. The curry was just the right amount of spicy. \n\nService was a little slow. It seemed like they had just gotten slammed and we were coming in right at the end of lunch rush. It took a while to get our food and it took a while for them to take the food away, get our bill and then for them to take  and run the credit card so we could leave.  I felt like they were rushed and so some customer service steps were definitely skipped. like checking back on us after we got our appetizer so we could order our drinks. I had to ask the food runner for drinks when he dropped off the entrees because the waiter never popped by to check on us. Not a huge deal - but when we placed our initial order we told the waiter we were debating on our drinks and asked to keep the menu so I was pretty sure he was looped into knowing we wanted to order drinks.\n\nFood was pretty killer and I would highly recommend it. My hope is next time we come with more people so I can try many more things and I want to thank my hubby for eating a curry dish when hes not the biggest fan :)"

            "review": "These days, thanks to sites like Yelp and television programs, restaurant hype is more prevalent than ever before.  Lotus of Siam has certainly benefited from positive coverage and word of mouth--just on my flight into Vegas, two groups seated next to me were talking about upcoming reservations.  But hype is a double-edged sword:  my expectations for my dinner were so high that nothing short of an unforgettable, \"I'll be talking about this years from now,\" kind of meal was going to be good enough.  Amazingly, Lotus of Siam met those expectations, and then some.\n\nMy extended family (party of 9) arrived at Lotus, and I immediately got ragged on--I am known for taking trips off the beaten path in pursuit of great meals, with mixed results, since most of my family generally favors \"meat and potatoes\" kind of establishments.  Lotus's location in a less-than-beautiful strip mall did not win me any points, but once inside, the restaurant is large and comfortable.  Because we were warned that the restaurant does not hold reservations, we arrived 20 minutes early, and after a quick drink at the bar, we were seated.\n\nLet's start with drinks--Lotus has all the standard beers and liquors you might expect at a Thai restaurant, but also has a very impressive (and appropriate) wine list, with great options at every price point.  This was a nice, unexpected touch.  Service was quick and friendly, as well.\n\nAs for the food, all I can say is that there was literally something for everyone:  the classics (Tom Kha, garlic prawns) that you can get at most Thai restaurants were made at a higher level.  There were outstanding vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat.  Some of the Northern Thai dishes were things I'd never seen before, and everything we tried (in particular, a green chili pepper dish) was a hit.  The curries were also universally delicious, and for those of you who like spice, rest assured that Lotus isn't afraid of adding real heat.  My brother joked that the menu was like the Cheescake Factory if it was good, and this is actually a pretty good analogy; it takes time to read through the encyclopedic menu and figure out what you're going to order, but at the end of the day, everything we chose was either very good or excellent.\n\nThis was an incredible meal, and I will never make a trip to Vegas without stopping by."

During our wait there was a car getting broken into.  Wait, did I already say the location is sketchy?\n\nSERVICE:  Bad.  We asked for extra spoons that never came.  The food took 30 minutes to come out.  While fuming, I saw two ladies who got seated way after us getting their food first.

We had the usual pad Thai, pad see ew, rad na, Thai fried rice, etc., and there was nothing special to write home about.  And the portions are tiny!

Worth a try but not worth eating more than once, very simple dish that you can probably make yourself with a deep fryer.\n\nPapaya Salad - Nothing special here, don't get me wrong it is good (you can't really mess up with papaya salad).  Again such a small portion, what are they expecting to feed, a baby rabbit??\n\nPad Thai - Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nSoft Shelled Crab Drunken Noodle - The soft shelled crap was crispy, and alright.  This was okay for me, it was quite salty but the blandness of the greens evened it out.\n\nSweet Coconut Rice, Fried Bananas - I enjoyed this very much however, again overpriced for something that tastes the same almost everywhere else.\n\nTom Kah Kai Hotpot - The soup was delicious, however the chicken was like rubber!\n\nHonestly after my group finished our dinner, we were hella confused because all of the other good reviews.

Nonetheless, we had heard such great things about the food so we were excited to give it a try. When we walked in, the inside was pretty cute. We had quite a long wait (as other reviewers said, reservations are a good idea). We thought we'd just go to the bar and have a drink while we waited. The bartender was AMAZING. I'm very picky about wines, and she let me taste a couple before ordering the one I wanted. When a table finally opened up, the dinner service was absolutely fantastic as well. Everyone was so friendly and attentive! As for the food, it was by far some of the best Thai I have ever had. I had the calamari garlic. I love calamari, but sometimes when I order it in restaurants it's really tough and chewy. The calamari here was SO tender. The sauce was spicy and fragrant: lots of garlic and cilantro.

Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch or for the buffet because not only was the food meh but the service was horrendous.\n\nWhen we got there, the host asked how many were in our party to be seated. We told them that our friends were already here and asked if they minded if we took a quick peek around the corner to see if they were seated already. The host said no problem and we walked past him. After looking for about 5-10 seconds, he walks back in front of us and says \"maybe they're not here yet\", as if to call us liars and try to seat us anyways. We walked back towards to entrance to call our friends to see where they were. The host follows us around the whole time as if we're not allowed to walk freely in the lobby. He continued to challenge us even after I told him nicely that our friends had texted us that they were seated somewhere inside before we even walked in. We eventually found our party, which had been seated towards the back.

I even grabbed some plates and threw them on an empty bar where nobody was sitting because they were piling up. I also had to get up and grab my own sauces and napkins from the waiters' supply corner...no customer service whatsoever, but this is an Asian restaurant so who knows if they even care. There was also not very many people there for the noon lunch hour compared to what you would expect when experiencing a lapse in service. Maybe 2/3 of the restaurant was full if even. Had the restaurant been completely full, I would've taken that into account. There was also some confusion when we were paying our bill so it seems like the hostess' don't know what they're doing either.\n\nThe buffet featured items such as chow mein, pad thai, garlic wings, mint chicken and other typical buffet foods. The selection was small as there were only 2 tables worth of food. Most of the food was bland (pad thai especially) and some of the fried items were 90% dough and not much filler (egg rolls, fried banana are examples). The only thing that I really ate more than a couple bites of was the chow mein and garlic wings...show I really just filled up on wings. Not really what you would expect at a Thai restaurant.\n\nWhile I was eating, I was already thinking about how I was going to word this review because I was unhappy the entire meal. Keeping in mind that it was only the buffet that we had, makes me want to go back and try ordering items from their menu. However, the service was a real turn off and I've had better service at fast food joints than what I had today at Lotus. I doubt we'd be back in the future. Not sure how this place got their Zagat rating because I'm pretty sure service counts for something."

And some of the more common Thai dishes, like pud Thai, are no better here than at your neighborhood Thai restaurant back home.\nLotus of Siam offers an exceptional variety of food. Beef jerky is always a winner for me as an appetizer. I also like the spicy crispy rice and the bacon-wrapped shrimp that are deep fried. (See my photos).\nTom ka gai is a chicken coconut soup they do so well. The way I get it normally in restaurants is that they cook the mushrooms in the soup. At Lotus of Siam they add fresh mushrooms right before they serve it. THat's a different way to do it and I like it. Also, if you look at my picture, you'll see a nice dose of chili sauce floating on top of the soup. Be forewarned about eating that straight. Make sure you mix up your soup before you eat it.\nThe duck dishes are usually pretty good at Lotus of Siam as well. \nIf you're not sure what you want, you can trust your server to order for you. Just tell them what you don't like and they can pick dishes for you.\nThe wine selection is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable."

Thought that odd. We arrived 5:20. There was already a line. Hostess came out to the group. Asked if anyone had reservations. I was peeved, cause I had called several times but no one picked up. Wonder how they had managed to get the woman to answer. Would we make the time deadline with just a smile and a walk in? But, who knew how big the place actually was. It's really much bigger than it appeared. Thank goodness. We were ushered in and the server was right there. The menu was incredibly extensive. At first sight, there were many items in the $12.00-14.00 range. Then there was the twenty five to thirty range. Like America, the middle class is vanishing. So were the menu items between the inexpensive to the expensive. I asked about he duck curry ($12.00). The waiter said the $26.00 one was better.  Of course it would be... The menu was filled with great choices that could cater to almost anyone's palate. I got the cheap duck curry, she got the drunken noodle seafood, and her husband got the beef salad. The amazing thing was the speed the food arrived at the table. I've seen buffet lines take longer. Each of the food items was very good. However, did feel that the medium spice was really not spicy at all. His beef salad, also medium spice, had a nice kick. I did find the proportion size of each to be small. Too small? Yes. Very tasty? Yes indeed. Service was lightening fast. The food choice on the menu was expansive. Taste was very very good. Just could have eaten a little more. But hey. I'm not European, satisfied with minimal food decorated by a blank plate background. I would come back, but, I'd order the expensive items as a challenge. O btw, made it to the show on time.

There isn't a vegetarian section of the menu here, but from the sound of it when I spoke to the waiter, it isn't uncommon for folks to request vegetarian versions of things, so I guess you can always ask!\n\nI got the Rad Na with tofu and mushrooms and specified that it needed to be vegetarian (in case of fish sauce, which is common) and mentioned my egg allergy and things came out okay. It was a lot saucier than I expected (it looked like soup when it came out, actually), but was tasty nonetheless. I also got a Thai iced coffee, and that was tasty (as it always seems to be, regardless of restaurant).\n\nMy non-vegetarian compatriots apparently thought the wonton soup was amazing (and ended up ordering two more rounds of the stuff, one more for the table and one solely for one person who liked it that much). Mr. Piano got the pad thai, and thought that was fine. The others I believe also ordered the sea bass and the crispy duck, and I think they preferred the duck. Not 100% sure on that. But they all felt it was quite good, so I'm inclined to believe them.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor and setting of the place is rather nice, and the service is pretty good. The menu is admittedly very large, so it's surprising that they can keep up with it and execute such a wide variety of dishes well. Also, that could be a problem for the terminally indecisive or the easily overwhelmed. Still, no vegetarian section, which would have been nice. The actual location of the place is a bit desolate (it seems like an abandoned strip mall, except for the Korean BBQ place which may or may not be on life support via the Korean tour bus we saw headed there), and we definitely arrived right when they were opening (with reservations, since there were 7 of us) and there was a line past two dead shop fronts before they started letting people in, so if you don't have a reservation, be aware that there's a lot of people going here for dinner. On a Monday, even.\n\nThat said, I didn't notice it being significantly better than other Thai food I've had, but since I could only try one dish and everyone else liked it so much, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I'd certainly eat here again if in the area--it's a good value for the money, and tasty :)"

I decided I MUST try it, so I made a reservation on a Friday night right after we got to town. I was so pleased with this decision.\n\nLotus is in a strip mall off the strip so you will need a car, a taxi, or an Uber/Lyft to get here. Everything else around it looks a little industrial or sketch and maybe there was a naughty club nearby, but it doesn't matter, just go.\n\nI made a reservation and they say they hold your reservation for precisely...3 minutes...so be on time. We got there right in time, but do allow for traffic when you are coming from the Strip.\n\nI would recommend perusing the menu before you get here. I not only read the menu front to back online (there are a lot of options), I also read some articles about the best things to get here. Of course, when I got there I read the menu again. It is all so exciting, but apparently what they have that many other Thai places don't is Northern Thai cuisine and a killer riesling menu.\n\nWe started by ordering an off dry riesling since we aren't much into sweet wines but wanted to try one to complement our spicy dishes. We got a bottle and were not disappointing. Apparently they have one of the best riesling menus of anywhere around and they really do go well with Thai food. Try some!\n\nAs for the food, I went with the waiter's recommendation of Nam Kao Tod. That's crispy rice with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, onions, ground dry chiles, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. I have never had anything like this. We went with 5 out of 10 on spice level to see what we were working with here and it was pretty spicy and it was fucking delicious. The crispy rice was a new one on me, it was like each individual piece of rice had been fried in spices and was individually crunchy and flavorful. I mean, it was a home run.\n\nFor entrees, we went Northern Thai to see what that was all about. I got Kang Ka Noon which is spicy young jack fruit curry. I mainly got this because I've never had jack fruit and I wanted that. I got it with pork, 5 out of 10 on spice. The curry was not thick, almost more like a stew. Jack fruit has an artichoke-like consistency so if you don't like that, you may not like this. Again, I have never had anything like this and we enjoyed it. The BF ordered the Sai Oua which is Northern style pork sausage. It was ground pork with herbs and spices and come pretty much medium spiced. It was sliced on the plate. I don't even know what is going on with this sausage, but we were in LOVE with it. What is that spice in there? We spent a lot of time trying to place it...anise? Nutmeg? Other? Just get this, it is soooooo goooood. We had all this with some sticky rice (and the curry also came with rice so that was a DOH on our part...).\n\nI must mention that this place is deceptively enormous inside and can seat a lot of people, but there are a lot of people there so be prepared to wait if you have no reservations. HOWEVER, despite the crush of people there, the waitstaff are really on point. They have bluetooth earpieces and talk to each other and everything just flows. Really a good setup.\n\nI was DELIGHTED, ECSTATIC, OVERWHELMED WITH JOY about Lotus of Siam. I WILL be back on every trip to Vegas."

I highly recommend the:\n\n-GARLIC PRAWNS ($21.95)\nMore of an appetizer, but these whole prawns are fried until crispy and have great garlicky salty flavor.  You can eat the shell!\n\n-KHAO SOI SHORT RIBS (19.95)\nVery tender short ribs served over noodles in a very addictive Panang (I think it's Panang) sauce.  The sauce tastes amazing over rice as well.\n\n-DRUNKEN NOODLES with CRIPSY DUCK (21.95).\nMy friends thought the duck was a little too spicy, but I thought it was very good.  The crispy skin reminds me of Peking duck.  I wasn't that impressed by the noodles though.\n\nService was very friendly but also very slow, especially after we got our food.  We didn't see our waiter again until we had to flag him down to get our check.  It then took 10 minutes for him to get it and another 15 for us to pay.

It was amazing! For an entr\u00e9e, I had crispy duck over Penang curry. It was pure perfection. It came with some white rice and was the perfect serving size. I would come here again without hesitation. Further, I would urge anyone who likes Thai food who happens to be in Las Vegas to visit this place immediately. It is a must."

            "review": "Rumored to be the \"best Thai restaurant in America,\" I can say the hype isn't too far off.\n\nYou can tell LoS was born from a small mom and pop restaurant that has been expanded to meet demand, and blossomed through word of mouth alone. This is not a calculated restaurant, and reputation was built on the merit of the food. Pulling into the dilapidated strip mall parking lot, I had a small tinge of \"where the hell are we?\"\n\nThe garlic prawns feature Jurassic-sized shrimp, the shells peeled so they dangle by the same tail -- battered and deep-fried for a garlicky crunch. \n\nThe Khao Soi curry was a bright curry with egg noodles, light on coconut milk, cut with lime juice. Highly recommend getting it with the roasted duck -- where the fat has been carefully rendered down so that each piece is crunchy and moist without excess fat. Tastes like they cut up duck confit to add to their curry.\n\nThe Tom Yum and Tom Kai soups were very complex, but very concentrated. Sharply sour, incredibly spicy (despite a \"medium\" level of spiciness.. they are NOT messing around). \n\nAdmittedly, the papaya salad -- while good in its own right -- was a little under developed compared to the other dishes. The papaya wasn't thoroughly beaten to soften it, and thus was unable to really take up the flavor of the dressing. Can't win them all!\n\nLotus of Siam will be a place I will insist on stopping by every trip to Vegas from now on."

When we got dropped off around 1:30 for a late lunch, the cabbie advised us to just have the restaurant call for a cab when we were done.  \n\nThinking nothing of it, I approached the counter and asked them to call for a cab when our bill came.  We were told there was a cabbie strike in progress in vegas, and the wait times could be 30-60 minutes.  So, we went outside, and sure enough, ended up waiting 30-40 minutes, and still no cab.\n\nSince we had eaten a late lunch, so the restaurant had closed to prepare for the dinner rush at this point, and out trots Saipin Chutima, along with her son and daughter.  We were standing with another couple who had been waiting nearly as long as we were, and all four of us recognized the owner and head chef from her appearance in the most recent season of Top Chef Masters.  They walked over to a pair of cars, and pulled them around in front of the restaurant.\n\nSaipin's daughter Pennapa introduced herself, and apologized for the lengthy delay of our cabs.  They then proceeded to offer us rides to the Las Vegas Hilton, which is the closest major resort to the shop, so that we could arrange quick transport to our final destinations, rather than wait here with uncertainty.  Needless to say, we all accepted.\n\nThe other couple went off with Saipin's son, while my wife and I got to ride with Saipin and her daughter, who drove.  They were both extremely pleasant, with Pennapa making small talk about our trip and lamenting the service they've been getting from the cabbies due to the strike.  They asked about our meal, and what we had liked and disliked.\n\nOnce we got dropped off at LVH, we waved goodbye, and stood next to the same couple again laughing and wondering what had just happened.  Say what you will about the location and decor of Lotus of Siam; you will never in your life find better service than what we received there.  \n\nOh, right.  The food.  That's easy... simply the best Thai I have ever eaten.  No question.\n\nWe had Nam Prik Ong, which I had never had before, but will now actively search for.  Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Sticky rice is a must with this dish.  We also had an order of drunken noodles with soft shell crab.  My wife and I agreed that it was the best we'd ever had.  Of course, we also had some Pad Thai.  Also the best we've ever eaten.\n\nGive this place your patronage at all costs; you will not be disappointed."

When I walked inside the waiting area, I felt like my suspicion was confirmed. The hostess offered for us to wait at their bar (all I remember thinking was how how a place so small could possibly fit a bar), and that was when I found that they do have ample space in the restaurant. \n\nThe food we ordered for the most part were all good, but two notable dishes that pushed me to give 5 stars instead of 4 were the catfish salad and the garlic prawns."

The flavor of the curry was great and wasn't just spice. The noodles and pickled vegetables were a good balance to my palate. Great dish.

Sooo glad we ordered this dish based on the reviews. I would've ordered another one if we weren't already so full! The prawns are huge and fried to PERFECTION. Super crispy and seasoned just right. I will definitely come back and order this every time. GO GET YOU SOME!!\n  Sea Bass w/Drunken Noodle - Lightly crispy on the outside and super flaky on the inside. Paired very well with the noodles and the flavors were well balanced. Worth trying, but definitely small for the price ($30 I think?). I'll be trying something else next time.\n  Crispy Duck w/Panang - Very yummy! You get to choose your spiciness level from 1-10 so I got 8. The spiciness wasn't spaced out very evenly, as the first couple of scoops of sauce/duck were very spicy and the last few bits weren't spicy at all. The sauce was delicious with rice, but I think I'll try the dish with mint and chili instead. I feel like the sauce made the duck less crispy. \n\nAMBIANCE\nLooks very unassuming from the outside. You would never know that such a great restaurant was located inside an old plaza like this. The restaurant itself is pretty large as they bought out the space next door and expanded. They even have a wine cabinet/wall displayed with TONS of wine to choose from. Everything from the decor to the music is pretty Asian/traditional.\n\nSERVICE\nMonday lunch service was super quick and our food came out within 5 minutes of ordering! The servers are also very knowledgeable and gave us some good recommendations.\n\nOVERALL\nDefinitely coming here again! I'm so glad we were able to stop by, especially at a good time and with no wait! Even if you've never tried or don't care for Thai food, I still recommend trying this place. The quality of food is something I've never seen at any Asian-owned restaurant."

            "review": "So after dinner I had a huge discussion with my friend Angela who lives here in Vegas about this place.  I mean, this place has gotten crazy reviews from everyone about being the best Thai place not only in Vegas but also North America.  And I walked out of this place thinking it was good, but definitely not amazing.  And I went on a Friday night.  We were thinking that maybe I didn't get their best chef-but who doesn't use their best chef on a Friday night?\n\nWell, I went with 4 other friends and we ordered a lot of different types of food.  We started with Tom Kah Kai which is a traditional coconut chicken soup almost every Thai restaurant makes.  It's ok.  Not great.  I've definitely had better.  I was a little surprised.  And I got myself a Thai tea.  Same thing, wasn't great.  Have definitely had much better.\n\nWe then got a spicy salad.  I don't remember which one.  This I liked more but only because it was really, really spicy.  Spicy and salads is a rare mix and it worked out with this salad.  But most my friends couldn't handle the spice.  I could barely handle it myself to be honest.  \n\nWe got a pad thai noodle dish, a pineapple fried rice and a fried sea bass dish.  Maybe, we got some more things though honestly I don't remember the rest.  Really tells you something when I can't quite remember what we ordered.  It's simply because the food wasn't that remarkable.  The sea bass was crazy disappointing.  I though we were getting an entire sea bass and only got a small cut of it.  I almost flipped the table over when they served the sea bass especially as it was the most expensive dish we got. $30 for this one plate.  Crazy, absolutely do not order this.  Completely overpriced.  You go to any other authentic Asian restaurant you're getting a whole fish for that kind of price.  Actually, you're getting a whole fish for less than that price.\n\nSo overall I was not impressed with this place.  Did I get the wrong chef?  I don't know.  I doubt different chefs are going to give you different portions of the fish-this is for sure.  So I thought the food was good and I wouldn't tell people to avoid this place.  But at the same time I don't think I'd come back here unless I was going with someone who'd eaten here multiple times and knew exactly which dishes to order and which ones not to."

Probably could've handled a couple levels hotter but didn't want to push our luck since Thai food tends to be on the spicy side. \n\nThis place was a little hard to find since it is in a unassuming strip mall."

            "review": "I found Lotus of Siam in Zagat's list of top rated restaurants in Las Vegas. A quick lookup on Yelp showed that it had a pretty good rating with 2000+ reviews so I decided to try it when I was in Vegas a couple of days ago. We tried calling them at around 7 pm to make a reservation but could not get through as their phone was constantly busy. We decided to take a chance and landed up at around 8:30 pm. To my surprise I found that Lotus of Siam was located next door to the now defunct Namaste Indian Cuisine a place that I had been too many times when it was open. Anyway even on a Monday evening they were completely packed and had a wait time of 45 minutes which stretched to almost an hour before we were seated. The restaurant is not very big but is a decent sized place that does not feel too cramped.\n\nAs there was only 30 minutes to closing we ordered a bunch of standard Thai dishes all at once like Crispy Fried Garlic prawns ($26.95), Pad se-ew ($9.95), Red Curry with shrimp ($13.95), Penang Curry with chicken (12.95), Combo fried rice ($11.95), Crab fried rice ($13.95) and Khoa Soi (10.95). Food was out in another 10 minutes so apart from the long wait to get a table service is pretty fast. I approached the food with a lot of skepticism as I've been burned too many times by these super hyped up places but after the first couple of bites it was clear that Lotus of Siam was legit and completely deserving of its high rating. The crispy fried garlic prawns were amazing, lightly battered, perfectly fried with a balanced taste that did not overpower the delicate crustacean. The pad se-ew was perfectly cooked noodles with just a mild sweet tang. Literally one of the best that I've had. The crab fried rice was another gem. Perfect taste without even a hint of the smell of crab. The Penang curry was also great. The noodles in the Khoa Soi were a little overcooked and hence were clumped together while the curry base was a little too watery so I thought that the dish did not come together very well. Taste-wise I thought that it had a good balance of sweet and spice, but most people in our group felt that it was too spicy for them. The red curry was not bad, just that it tasted very similar to the Penang curry. \n\nI felt that prices at Lotus of Siam were less than what you would pay at other similar Thai places but when compared with the inflated prices on the strip they seemed out-rightly cheap. Considering the overall package of service, cost and quality the only drawback that I can think about is the long wait to get a table. I'm almost tempted to deduct a star for just that, as it could seriously keep me from returning, but I'm going to overlook it and give them the rating that they deserve."

It's some of the best casual food you'll find in the area. \n\nThe location is a short cab ride from the LV Strip in a older little Asian strip mall- don't expect much on that end. On the other hand, the food is great, the prices are good, and the wait isn't too long if you pick a good time to get there."

My one tip is that when they ask you what level of spice you want (1-10), subtract 3 from whatever you think you want. My husband and I love spicy food, but he was really shocked by the level of heat in the level-6 papaya salad. (As in, he had to excuse himself to get some fresh air before powering through and enjoying the other dishes.) There were a million things that we wanted to try, but we settled on these four, and managed to finish all four dishes between the two of us.\n\nWe enjoyed: \n* Papaya salad - As mentioned above, a 6 was very, very spicy. Worth it, though!\n* Nam kao tod - Crispy rice appetizer with a uniquely sour taste. \n* Drunken noodles with soft shell crab - Flat noodles with fried soft shell crab.\n* Panang curry with crispy duck - The creamy curry amazingly did not affect the crispiness of the duck skin. \n\nThe service was excellent, and we enjoyed a nice bottle of Riesling with our meal. Very much worth the cab ride from the Strip."

I was in Vegas for a week and we visited this place 3 times.  Loved it.\n\nAll my favorite dishes were found under the Chef Choices section of their menu.  My top favorite dish was the deep-fried prawns with shell with pepper in special garlic sauce.  We tried both versions of the deep-fried prawns but garlic was hands-down easily the best (the other was just okay).  \n\nWe also ordered a Whole 2-pound CharGrilled Catfish in our 2nd visit.  It was yummy but we agreed we wouldn't order this version again.  First, it takes 45 mins. to prepare (which we were told, of course).  Second, the catfish skin was a bit too well-done (burnt) for our tastes (and we like BBQ).  The cooked catfish meat was very good and it was worth trying.  We'll probably try another cooked version of  whole catfish next time we're here, visiting Vegas.\n\nI also recommend the Chilean Sea Bass, the Crab Fried Rice and their Drunken Noodle with whatever [insert meat of preference].  \n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass was also excellent but I've had equally good sea bass for less in price.  Not a super value dish but the quality was excellent.  The crab fried rice was also excellent.   We had crispy duck w/ drunken noodle and it was good, not spectacular (since being asian, I've had quite a lot of duck).  \n\nChoose the spice level of your food to suit your preference.  I don't tend to go too spicy and since I have a fairly low spicy tolerance level, we usually choose Level 2.  We tried Level 4 and it was too hot for me halfway into the second serving.  For those who like it spicy, just ignore my warning and go for whatever rocks your socks!  \nEnjoy!"

Located in a very random strip mall and (according to our cab driver) dangerous neighborhood, Lotus is a great surprise for out-of-town visitors.  \n\nWhile the reputation of this restaurant precedes it, we were pleasantly surprised.  The food is not fancy but when exiting customers report that it's \"worth the wait\" to those waiting in 104 degree heat, you know you're know you're spending time well worth waiting.  Upon seating, we noted the myriad of photographs of famous (and mysterious) patrons who have eaten at Lotus.  \n\nFrom the San Francisco Bay Area, where Thai restaurants are found on every corner, I found Lotus to capture traditional flavors, especially in the Crispy Rice appetizer and the large shrimp fried in their shells (which was amazing).  Aside from the scorching summer heat, the level of spiciness in the dishes can KO the novice.  The Thai pepper \"salsa\" is only for those with asbestos mouths--don't think that cucumber and carrots will save you, they won't.  It was too hot even for our guide who had been there weekly for over nine months.  \n\nOverall, the meal was exciting.  I look forward going back to Las Vegas to so I may return to Lotus."

However I have to stick to the 1 star for this restaurant and that is only because the food is good. \n\nI walked in at 7:50PM looking for a table for 2. It was well over an hour wait, which we were okay with, but after the hour had passed we had to physically go inside and fight for a table. Finally after being embarrassed and realizing that they had forgot about our party they gave us a table. Since it was late already and we knew what we wanted we ordered everything at once. Appetizer, entr\u00e9e and drinks. We got our appetizers right off the bat and it was some delicious Tom Kah Gia. It however took us over an hour once again to get our food. by that time the soup had turned cold. When we complained to the manager he stated that they offset meals by 10 to 20 mins, but I fought back and told him that we ordered everything at one time, so there should be no reason why things are late. He apologized and said he would take care of us and would do everything he can to make us happy. I thought that maybe this meant a discount on the bill.\n\nWhen the bill came it was full priced and no discount applied to anything. When I asked to see the manager one more time took about 20 mins for him to walk over to us and I had to remind the waiter multiple times to talk with manager, perhaps the worst customer service experience of my life. When he walked over I showed him the bill and asked what have you done to accommodate our hardships. He said \"oh yeah...\" and walked away. He then returned with some ice cream desert, but both me and my party were full and did not want dessert so he basically brought out something that was a complete waste, he should have just discounted the bill with the price of the ice cream. \n\nSo in the end I walked in at 7:50PM left the restaurant at 10:30PM very upset at how the manager had handled the situation. I will not be returning to this restaurant and will warn people of the service here. I don't care how famous the place is or how good the food is, the management is destroying the hard work the cooks and everyone else puts forth. \n\nMy previous experience was just the same, but they actually forgot to bring me an entr\u00e9e I ordered, that was 2 years ago. I am sad to see that things have not changed much :("

The Nam Kao Tod appetizer was bursting with a variety of flavors and something you don't find at most Thai places.  The cabbage in the dish was so tender and delicious!  Also recommend the Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab.  Wash it all down with a nice Thai beer and you'll be happy.  Place was packed when where were there late on a Monday night.  Careful, cause the neighborhood is a bit sketchy at night."

            "review": "Sometimes you encounter a restaurant that knocks your socks off from out of the blue.  Lotus of Siam was not one of these establishments.  After hearing rave reviews from Gourmet Magazine, J. Gold and that putu from Kevineats.com, I felt compelled to dine at what many have claimed to be \"The best Thai restaurant in North America\".  Dear readers, I think they may be onto something.\n\nDitching our group of friends, my Thai paramour and I courageously walked-in to the restaurant without a reservation and were quoted 1:30 wait for a party of two.  Luckily, mi corazon is as fluid in her native tongue as she is easy on the eyes and successfully flirted (right in front of the ignorant farang guests) our way into a table after only 15 minutes.  Yet another example of the eventual geopolitical power shift from the West to the Orient, suckaz!\n\nThis would prove to be an auspicious beginning to what would culminate in the best meal of our Vegas trip and quite possibly the year.  Unfortunately for us, we were only a party of two and we also had a pressing engagement at XS after dinner.  Because of this, we weren't able to order the full breadth of the menu (like garlic lobster and crab dishes) but we made do with:\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Issan Sausage)\nKhao Soi (Egg Noodles in Coconut broth with chicken)\nCrispy Duck with Penang Curry\nGarlic Prawns\n6 glasses (1 bottle plus 2 additional servings) of Prum 2009 Kabinett Riesling\n\nAs mi corazon expressed to me after the first few bites, this is as good as it gets outside of the homeland.  Granted, she remarked that the cuisine was a bit \"fusion\" and not within strict adherence to traditional Thai cusine, but she was nonetheless glowing with her praise.  As for your humble author, dear readers...  I was in Siamese heaven, fusion or no.\n\nAll of the dishes we ordered were excellent, with the Khao Soi and the Nam Kao Tod being my personal favorite.  In addition, the crispiness of the garlic prawns was perfectly married to the garlic infusion and the duck meat was SO juicy and provided a perfect (albeit extremely rich) counterpoint to the Penang curry.  All of the food went amazingly with the J Prum Riesling, a steal at $35 a bottle...\n\nMaybe I had a few too many glasses of the aforementioned wine, because I distinctly remember in between bites whispering to my girlfriend that I wanted to have sex with her on top of all the sumptuous vittles.  Of course, being the modest Thai lady that she is, she shushed me and expertly directed my passions towards the food despite entreaties from your humble author for acceptance of, \"just the tip, sweetie...  come on, just the tip\".  \"OK, OK, later!\" she hissed at me.  What a saint, mi corazon...\n\nLocated in a semi-grimy strip mall, the location is nothing special, but the food was several notches above any Siamese cuisine I've had in the states.  Surprisingly, the service was very good as well.  Granted, I'm always expecting treatment at Asian restaurants to be one notch above the brutality that American POW's experienced by the Japanese during the Bataan Death March...  but illustrative of Thailand's \"Land of Smiles\" moniker, the servers were gracious, friendly and efficient.\n\nTotal bill came out to $123 for all that food and wine.  Officiously, I took out $25 in cash and gently put it in the payment tray.  \n\n\"What, you're not going to pay for the rest of the meal?\" asked my now beleagured (but very satiated) girlfriend.  \n\n\"Just the tip, sweetie\" I replied slurringly...  \"Just the tip.\""

Once you get inside the restaurant you see all tons of wine's behind a glass. A big restaurant clean inside that looks nothing like the horrible outside. Service is really attentive and makes sure your table is always clean. \n\nThe food here was superb. Next time I come here I'm only ordering the specialty dishes. The typical dishes are great but they have such an awesome menu that every dish we got blew my mind. The tom yum kai soup is delicious and you can't go wrong with that. The pad thai they use thin noodles which made me like it even more! The sea bass drunken noodles was crack. The fish itself was so tender it was like butter. The green curry was another highligh that felt like eating coconut butter on top of rice. I couldn't get enough of it. The raw beef tar tar was light and fresh. The fried rice was good but probably the least memorable of the dishes. Next time I come here I'm getting the deep fried prawns. If you visit Vegas make sure to stop by this place. You will not be disappointed.\n\nRecommendation: Sea Bass Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai, and Green Curry"

Now after a couple of visits I can confirm with all of them, LoS was probably one of the best meals of my life!\n\nI've read a lot of reviews about many of the other Thai places in town. And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I've been to a lot of those places as well.. So what's the conclusion? I don't think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more..\n\nPlaces like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi's etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says \"this is drunken noodles.\" At LoS, it still says  \"this is drunken noodles\", but it's totally different from every one I've ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven't had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten this year (them prawn shells..)\n\nWhenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn't just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!"

I just had Thai food the other day and most of the time I don't like repeating similar types of food for at least a few days/meals.. BUT Thai Noodle House left such a savory taste in my mouth that I wanted More!! BUT More from a new place, a place that so many people seem to worship! This place doesn't seem to lure in just us locals but also the rich and famous! I'm ready for Thai food Round 2:\n\nWhat gave me a New Outlook on Thai Food:\n\nGround Chicken Larb: ground chicken with chopped onion, green chili, lime juice and fresh cabbage\n\n- Tried this because it was recomended. Quite Fresh, Limey, Crunchy (cabbage) and Chicken was Good. And Most importantly Spicey!! for me at least.. We opted for 4/10 (default, if you don't mention how spicy, you get thir medium hot which starts at 4 Not 5) on the heat scale and this already made me feel like a fire breathing dragon!! Don't be fooled, if your not into spicy you may want to order a 3 at most. For comparison: I've tried a 10/10 heat scale at Pin Kaow and Thai BBQ.. The 4 here was hotter! \n\nDrunken Noodle Sliced Chicken: pan fried flat noodle, topped with sauteed chicken, fresh and dry chili, thai basil on a bed of greens\n\n- My girl doesn't really eat seafood, so she substituted for chicken. I thought I've tried Great Thai flat noodle chicken dishes in the past but boy was I wrong! Chicken Tender and Very Tasty, Herbs and Spices (3/10 heat) was just right and flat noodles couldn't be any better! \n\nPad Se-Ew Sliced Pork: stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg, chinese broccoli and black soy sauce\n\n- One of my favorite all time Thai dishes. I never tried a bad version of this dish but their pork here was better than any I've tried and again the flat noodles stood out themselves. 4/10 heat scale but didn't seem to have as much heat as the Chicken Larb dish?.. Really Good for Pad Se-ew.\n\nDrunken Noodle Halibut: deep fried halibut filet with homemade fresh chili and thai basil, over pan fried flat noodles\n\n- Best Thai dish I've Ever Had.. Period. I don't know where to start.. The fish fillet had a nice breading, lightly fried and was flaky fresh. Their blend of chilis/herbs/spices blend were Unreal!!!! All on top of their pan fried flat noodles! By now you should know how I feel about their flat noodles! I ordered this at a 5/10 thinking it wouldn't be too much heat but it was blazing! Next time I would order this at a 3 but it was So Magically Delicious,  it didn't matter!!\n\nThai Iced Tea:\n\n- Great way to subside the heat from the food! Had a stronger flavor than usual.\n\nCoconut Ice Cream:\n\n- Very Fresh Islandy Flavor! If you have room for it, Try It!\n\nAfter having Homemade Thai food and Several Thai restaurants, I think its safe to for me to consider this place the Mecca of Thai Food!  The drunken noodle halibut  revolutionized the way I view Thai Cuisine. My experience here was Insanely Satisfying I wanted to give my waiter a Hug!!!!!!"

Tonight got here at 5:30 and the wait was an hour. \n\nTIPS:\n- Come at 5 to get in line so when they open at 530 you're first\n- Or call for a reservation but their phone is always busy so try calling 1-2 days in advance. Also if you're not here within 5 mins of your reservation, you lose your spot\n\nWHAT WE ORDERED TONIGHT: \n1. Crispy duck panang - THIS IS A MUST TRY. Every time we're here. We usually get this spicy since I think it enhances the flavor. This time we got medium and while still good, spicy would've tasted better. The sauce is AMAZINGG I don't waste a drop of it so once the duck is all gone I put some rice in the dish and mix it with the sauce and yummmm *___*\n2. Tom yum soup- was not so yum. Not sure why but the last two times I've been here (tonight included) I wasn't very impressed with the soup. It tasted pretty bland and lacking in flavor. I've had better. This is why 4 stars \n3. Sea bass with drunken noodles - first time trying this and will definitely order this again the next time! \n4. Lamb (the waiter suggested this as it was the special) I personally am not a big fan of lamb so can't really give my opinion on whether or not it was good\nAnd then the defaults:\n5. Pad Thai - 4/5 \n6. Pad See Ew - my nephew hogged it all before I could get a taste but I didn't hear any complaints and he's very picky with his pad see ew!\n\nThe portions are not as big as other Thai restaurants I usually go to so if you're planning to share at the table, keep that in mind! We usually order as many dishes as there are people in our party and keep a menu on the side in case we're still hungry.\n\nService is great and the waiters are very nice!"

(Northern, Southern, etc.) My bf and I had decided early on that we would eat at the lunch buffet instead so we arrived at around 11:45 am and the restaurant was already pretty packed. Lotus of Siam opens at 11:30 am and the lunch buffet is served from 11:30 am-2:30 pm.\n \nFor $10.99 a person, the lunch buffet is worth the price because there were many different options (steamed, stir-fry and fried) to select from. There was your standard sliced fruit (green melon, watermelon and pineapple) and salad. The Thai food included steamed white rice, Thai fried rice, chow mein, pad thai, pad see ew, chicken green curry, a tofu stir-fry and another vegetable stir-fry. The fried food included: egg rolls, curry wontons, tempura and delicious fried bananas! There were also 2 types of soups available: a hot and sour soup and a soup with clear broth. My bf preferred the soup with the clear broth and vegetables.\n \nFor me, the stand out dishes were the pad thai and green chicken curry! Both were tasty and the green chicken curry had large chunks of both vegetables and chicken. I even went back for seconds of the curry! \n\nThe service was good. It looked like there were only 1-2 people working the front of the restaurant and our waters were refilled.\n \nBottom line: This Thai place may be out off the strip but it is well worth the drive for good AYCE Thai food. If I return, I will probably order off the menu next time to compare with the AYCE food."

I don't drive in certain parts of Sahara so, finding this place was a bit tricky.  \n\nOur reservation last night was at 6pm and I heard the hostess say to one of the servers that they can't take any more reservations so, I was glad we called the night before.  When we got there, there were plenty of empty tables but sure enough, the place got busy in a matter of minutes.  The servers were scrambling and were trying to rush us.  I mean, they have a pretty huge menu (since they have dishes from different regions in Thailand) and making a quick decision wasn't that easy.\n\nWe got appetizers: nua dad deaw (beef jerky) and mee krob.  For entrees: beef panang, drunken noodle with soft-shell crab and kana moo grob (crispy pork with Chinese broccoli).  For dessert: fried banana and coconut ice cream with sticky rice.\n\nNua dad deaw: \nI'm not a fan of jerky but this was great.  You get about 8 pieces of beef that comes with a dipping sauce.  The jerky was flavorful so, no need for the sauce.\n\nMee krob:\nCrispy noodles with chicken, shrimp, and sweet and sour sauce.  It was sweet and I enjoyed the crispy noodles.\n\nBeef panang:\nTender pieces of beef with really good sauce.  The best I've had in Vegas.\n\nDrunken noodle with soft-shell crab:\nWe ordered it spicy# 5 but we got about a #8.  I liked the flavor on the noodles despite the intense heat.\n\nKana moo grob:\nI always get this at any Thai restaurant I go to.  The sauce was great, the pork was tasy and crispy and the broccoli fresh and crisp.  Again, the best I've had in Vegas.\n\nFried banana:\nYou get skinny fried rolls of fried banana with powdered sugar on top.  Nothing exciting.  I've had better.\n\nCoconut ice cream with sticky rice:\nIt was ok but it would've been much better if mangoes were in season so we could've gotten mangoes with sticky rice instead.\n\nI don't know why I waited this long to give Lotus of Siam a try but I'm glad I finally did.

(Bf's fav!) \n\nChilean Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles $30.95\nFried Soft Shell Crab with Drunken Noodles $22.95\n-small portion of delicious noodles but they're perfectly chewy! Both the deep fried chilean sea bass and soft shell crab are amazing! Neither would disappoint. \n\nCrispy Duck with Panang $27.95 -Amazing! Tender pieces of duck with a light crispy coating on thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. \n\n..and the forgettable dishes.. \n\nTom Kah Kai Soup $10.95 -sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushrooms, galanga, lemongrass and lime juice. Omg..it was soooo sour. We had to ask the waiter to take it back to make it less sour. : /\n\nNam Prik Ong \"chili dip\" $11.95 -one of the least spicy northern chili dips..it's actually not spicy at all! It has ground pork, tomato, and dried spices. It reminds me of meat sauce..and it comes with a small assortment of veggies and fried pork skins to dip. (Jet Tila ordered this..meh. Lol)\n\nNam Kao Tod $8.95 -this was okay..I've had better nam kao in Oakland. \n\nTheir menu is verrry extensive! Everything we ordered was that was delicious was mostly in the \"Chef's Choice\" section. Stick to those dishes and you won't be disappointed!

We ordered some kind of sausage which had a spicy, just alright flavor but seemed dry, a spicy and sour soup which was at the same time one of the spiciest and one of the most sour food II have ever eaten, which was very interesting, a green curry, chicken vermicelli which was good but seemed a bit bland as well, and then a roasted pork stew over rice which was great although came in a very small portion.  \n\nMaybe I should've tried what they are known for but then again I wanted to try a variety of food.

But the food was authentic, not your typical American Thai menu, yummy, and the service was very good.  We ordered short ribs with egg noodles in red coconut milk curry, a chicken curry dish (\"unique curry\" in a rice powdered red curry base) that was kind of a soup, and the chopped meat dip with raw vegetables that has gotten much press from ming tsai.  Specifically, the names of the dishes: khao soi braised short rib, kang omm, and nam prik ong, My favorite was the Lotus Of Siam special, the kang omm, because the flavor of the broth was so savory, and the vegetables so wonderfully prepared.\nThe coconut curry dish with short rib, khao soi, was also good, but be ready for a sauce that is sweeter than it is spicy or savory.  \nThe meat dip thing, nam prik ong, was interesting and is reminicent of a bolognese to my palate, but it is much more subtle to someone with a more discerning palate like my husband.\nMAKE RESERVATIONS! Most of the people who came waited on line for upwards of an hour or were turned away altogether.  But we were seated right away because we had reservations.\nThe waitstaff is very friendly, and they refilled our water right away.

I copped a look at the buffet and it didn't look that great anyway. It looked kinda Chinese. \n\nThe menu was large and had clear descriptions (in FOBese) of the items. And although you can make a lot of Thai meat dishes vegetarian, they did not have a section of the menu specifically for vegetarians. Like Komol. \n\nTo start, we ordered the famous tom kah kai soup. It was really good, but really fattening, I think all it is is coconut milk, chili oil, and maybe chicken broth with bland chunks of chicken, straw mushroom, and cilantro (?). But I could sit there and drink the broth all day. You can get a cup, bowl, or hot pot. I think my cup was $4. \n\nWe tried the panang just because I needed to compare and contrast to neighboring Komol's killer panang. I always get the tofu panang because I'm a part-time vegetarian (fair weather, really). LOS's panang was just like red curry. I don't know what's closer to original recipe, LOS or Komol's, but Komol's just tastes better. Its really robust and hearty. LOS's was really smooth and wussy. It just slipped off the tofu. \n\nWe also got the steamed mussels. They steam it in fish sauce and basil leaves and give you a green chili lime dipping sauce which has even more fish sauce and is deceptively spicy. Just because it ain't red, don't mean it ain't spicy. It was really fishy. And the sauce was way too hot for me consume.\n\nWe got the sweet sticky rice dessert, which I think is normally supposed to come with mango, but they were 86 for the day. The dessert was good. Standard stuff. But the coconut milk was really thick and they garnished the rice with a crispy topping, like baked rice or something. That gave the texture a nice variation. \n\nSorry, I don't have a cost breakdown of all the items, but for the two of us three entrees, two sticky rice, two drinks, and dessert, and some leftovers, our total bill was $53 before tip. Not bad, I guess. Holy crap, we did eat a lot ... Our entrees ranged $8-15. \n\nThe restaurant has a homey kind of ambiance. The ceiling is low and the walls are decorated with Thai things and pictures of the proprietress (I'm guessing) and guests. I like the way the restaurant is sectioned. It keeps the noise down. \n\nBy the time we were done with our meal, the restaurant was packed and the buffet was wrecked. \n\nI appreciate this place. Their menu is impressive, the food and service was good, it was clean, and prices were decent, but I'd pick Komol over Lotus of Siam. Komol hits the same points, but their panang is better. Haha. \n\nI think I'll come to like it more when I find the super great items on the menu.\n\n(To date, Lotus of Siam has 120+ reviews and Komol has 7.) \n\n* off the strip, non-casino"

The decor is finally being elevated a little closer to the high quality of the food. Surprisingly, I didn't think my meal was as exceptional as my last visit in September 2009. It was still super yummy, but didn't have the same wow factor. Is it the remodel? Larger dining room?

Only down side was my expectations going in were sky high. However it really says something when not only was I not let down but my expectations were actually exceeded. \nI've heard that everything on the menu is great and so far that's true although some things are a bit more amazing than others. I've been here twice so far, and both times have ordered number #14 on the appetizer menu. I can't remember the exact name of it but I refer to it as crispy rice salad. One of the best dishes I can remember getting in a long time. \nThe menu is very long and has a bigger variety than most typical Thai restaurants so you might need some guidance. On my first visit, the server recommended Sea Bass Drunken Noodles. I saw a prior reviewer mention it was \"like crack\" and I would have to agree with them. The Sea Bass was very tender and the noodles and sauce were very flavorful. The next time I came, I forced myself to try something different. The server recommended some sort of noodle dish that was more like soup. It was still good but I definitely preferred the drunken noodles to it. But really, seems like you can't go wrong with almost anything here.\nWe actually tried to come to Lotus of Siam several years ago but we thought we were in the wrong place since the center its in looks a bit run down, to put it nicely. So if you have never been here, be forewarned. Once you enter however, the place looks legit. Take a glance at all the pictures of celebrities and famous chefs who have dined here to convince you.\nMy only complaint is that they are not open for lunch on weekends. Since its location is a bit out of the way, it's more convenient to come to for lunch and I would guarantee I'd be here on every Vegas trip if I could come in for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday. On my last week Vegas trip, I literally scheduled my trip around a lunch visit here by going on a long weekend and staying through Monday. I won't always have that option though so unfortunately I'll probably miss out on the deliciousness of Lotus of Siam on some future trips to the desert."

We were a bit fearful (or at least I was) of our luggage being in the car as we ate since the plaza looks really ghetto.  We got there a bit too late being as there was a group of extremely eager eaters who got there about half a second before us and took the last open table.  The wait wasn't as bad as I expected from other reviews here.  We waited for only about 10 or 15 minutes for a table.  But, being as hungry as we all were, that wait seemed like an eternity.\n\nWe ordered pad thai, papaya salad, a red curry dish, fried tofu, and beef salad (I think it was the #58 or something).  Pad thai was amazing!  One of the best I've ever had.  The papaya salad was good too, but I've had better at some other Thai restaurants.  The red curry dish was good, but it is spicier than you will expect it to be.  My favorite of them all was the FRIED TOFU!  it's just deep fried tofu with I think what was a sweet and sour sauce with peanuts.  It doesn't sound very fancy, but the sauce just makes the dish complete.  The tofu is of the right crispness and it just melts in your mouth.  The beef salad was only mediocre in comparison to the other dishes.\n\nI only want to deduct half a star because first, there were no mangoes for the sticky rice w/mango dish, which I was half expecting.  Second, when I asked for fried banana with the dish instead of the mango, they didn't have the sticky rice!!! But do not fear.

Big pieces of chicken and tons of mushrooms and tomato !! Next came the chicken satay, very tasty !! Than the crying tiger , thinly sliced beef it was awesome but served cold, ( as I'm not familiar with the dish, it is said that that is how it normally is served) but could have used a little warmth for my taste! Very soon our entree arrived basil crispy pork!! I could just die!! It was awesome! I requested no oyster sauce and they said they cooked it in soy sauce and chili sauce!! But the flavor was absolutely amazing!! Also the green curry was great , a little to sweet for my taste, but request the chili tray , so u can spice things up to your liking, my friend micheal ordered the minced chicken 15 star spicy, which I didn't try , but made my friend cry!!

I went there ages ago when it was a small strip mall restaurant. This time around they got more space next door and a walk in wine cellar, really?! \n\nSo you would imagine that the food quality would suffer it bit because of the volume of traffic, NOT A BIT! I actually found subtle hints of improved flavor profiles and a combination of natural ingredients. There's no heavy salt and powdered spices to mask the otherwise dull flavors that most places have. \n\nMost ethnic restaurants have the ideology of heavily spicing road kill and people would buy it. But if you really knew what it was you would puke before it got to the table. Anyway, what I mean is that you can easily mess up fish and spice, but not here. They really get it.\n\nThe menu is vast and complex for those who don't know much about Thai food, so ideally you want to go with a large group and get as much as you can to taste. \n\nThis is also probably the only Thai restaurant in the country that I know of that has such a well selected wine list. I think I know wine but when I saw this I was shocked! Pairings from regions beyond us so you go in blind and it just works! They know their stuff and will guide you well.\n\nSo now it's an annual event during convention time to go to Lotus. I look forward to my meal next year again."

They have a great menu with many options from the Northern and Southern regions of Thailand.  But they got too popular for their own good, and like often happens, the quality slipped away.  They are the quintessential spot for inconsistency in my book--putting out incredible dishes on one trip, and offering up apathetic shadows of a former self the next.  I have been over a dozen times and the last 4 or 5 times left me with this sentiment deeply ingrained in my heart, soul, and mind...when they are on though, they certainly do put out some special dishes!"

The restaurant looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, so I was concerned that I might have come to a bad area. There seemed to be enough other people standing around waiting for taxis that I wasn't too concerned (though I did keep looking around me as I walked to my car to make sure I was safe!)\n\nInside, the restaurant looks much nicer. There is a glass enclosed wine cellar in the background and photos of celebrities who have eaten there on the wall. \n\nTheir menu is huge and I'm sure I didn't order the most adventuresome dishes since I wanted to be able to compare their dishes to ones I am familiar with. \n\nI went with my mom, who is gluten intolerant and also can't tolerate spicy food. The wait staff very courteously took note of her dietary restrictions and actually followed them (she sometimes will order food prepared \"mild\" from restaurants only to find it intolerably spicy to eat). I was pleasantly surprised about this since some restaurants with foreign (or even domestic, for that matter) cuisine don't understand when you make a request to prepare things gluten free. \n\nWe had thai iced teas, green papaya salad, massaman curry, and mango with coconut sticky rice. All of the food was excellent. \n\nSo in summary: you might get lost finding the place, but it is a good place to bring friends to with dietary restrictions. I don't think the food we tried was any more amazing than any other good Thai restaurant I've been to, but I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good Thai restaurant with an extensive menu."

I was usually deterred because I never really frequent the area it is in and I heard the wait to get a table there can be atrociously long (my friend once was told a 2 hour wait for a table of 5).  I even tried calling to make reservations a few different times and each time they were booked solid days in advance.  I finally buckled down and mentally prepared myself for a long wait.  The area it is located in isn't the nicest part of town and the outside of the restaurant is really unassuming.  I'm pretty sure there were a few people turning tricks in or near the parking lot but anyways...when my friend and I arrived at around 6 pm on a Saturday night we were both so surprised to be seated right away!  \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is clean and actually quite large and nicely decorated with a large wine cellar you can look into through the glass walls. The service was friendly and helpful when giving recommendations too.   \n\nWhat we ordered:\n-Crispy Duck with the Panang Curry ($27.95) - Not going to lie when I saw the price of this dish I was a little thrown off by it, I guess it's because I'm so used to cheap prices for other Thai dishes at other places.  I ended up biting the bullet and ordering anyways and I'm glad I did!  The curry had a nice kick to it (you can modify spicy level of your dish on a scale of 1-10) very flavorful, but the main star of the dish was the duck.  The duck had a nice crispy skin on the top and the meat was nice and juicy.  My friend I was with never had duck before and tried it and he really enjoyed it to.\n-Yellow Curry with Chicken ($10.95) - I honestly was so enamored with my crispy duck that I didn't have any of my friend's yellow curry.  He said it was good though and enjoyed it. \n\nI will definitely be back to try their other dishes, I'll probably make a reservation way in advance to avoid my wait time anxiety though."

Lotus of Siam epitomizes this as an unpretentious restaurant serving Thai food so earth-shattering, it is as if a pack of elephants has trampled through your prior memories of pad Thai and tom yum.\n\nLotus of Siam was unearthed when a friend heard about it on an Anthony Bourdain show, and it was placed on the Vegas food list. Although the wait is notorious, we got there a little after 9pm and it was only a 10-minute wait, during which we perused the extensive menu (and it still took quite some time to decide once seated; the pages of Thai delicacies were endless!). The catch for the last seating is that the kitchen was taking last orders, so there was no chance to add anything. We decided to err on the side of ordering too much, and it was the best decision we made on the entire Vegas trip.\n\n(+++) GARLIC PRAWNS (deep fried prawns with shells, almost like potato chips, saut\u00e9ed with our special garlic sauce, topped with ground black pepper) Almost like potato chips. Love that description! The hype cannot be more real, and you likely won't be able to eat shrimp the same way again. The shrimp itself was fresh and succulent, and the highlight was the shell which was deliciously umami with a kick from the pepper and garlic. I devoured it even though I usually detest shrimp shells (hurray, finally I get my glucosamine). \n\n(+++) TOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style; a distinctive soup of sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushrooms, galanga, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice) The spices and seasonings render a tantalizing complexity, bold and adventurous like an adventure to Thai street food, yet simultaneously unique and meticulous like a long-standing family recipe. I especially liked the touch of coconut milk, making it indulgent but not too creamy. Probably one of the more under-rated dishes as the garlic prawns steal the spotlight. As a bonus, this is served in a pot with an open flame, which looks exotic and neat in pictures (but the shape made it difficult to scoop the soup towards the end... when we were all craving more sopu)\n\n(++) KHAO SOI (typical Burmese influenced dish, served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables) We decided to get the beef version since the famous duck khao soi was quite a lot pricier. Like the rest of the dishes, the flavors were untamed with rich curry paired with coconut cream, contrasted by lime and pickled vegetables. The noodles were soft and mild, quiescent in juxtaposition with the fiery broth, and the wonton crisps added a playful garnish. Beef was okay, nothing special (thankfully so since I'm running out of my repertoire of food description words)\n\n(++) PAD THAI (stir-fried thin rice noodles with eggs, green onions, bean sprouts and chopped peanuts on the side) Homey and more familiar, though still noticeably different from your typical pad Thai. Their version was not greasy and very well balanced, at the intersection of aromatic, spicy, and savory. We took the rest to-go and enjoyed heavenly leftovers two days later as our last meal in Vegas (even after our palates had been spoiled by Bacchanal).\n\nIt totaled $81 for 3 people, which is considerably more expensive than your typical Thai joint but a completely different level. The Northern Thai style is distinctive, made even more so by the chef's style. According to the website, she utilizes what has been passed down in generations. Lotus of Siam has no neon lights or Corinthian columns and is unimpressively located in a strip mall, but the food speaks for itself--flawless in technique, exotic in flavor profile, and interpretative in embedding the culinary tradition of the chef's roots."

It's a big place that works like a well greased engine but it's always packed.\n\nBe adventures the menu is big with things that could sound scary to some but trust in your waiter (like I did) and you won't be disappointed.\n\nMy waiter recommend the three following dishes \n\nNam Prik Ong - a dish made with a blend of spices, herbs and ground pork you can adjust the heat to your liking. Out of the three it was my least favorite because it was weird to eat without some sort of lettuce leaf to but it in. Still very good and I can see why it's one of Ming Tsai's favorite things to eat. \n\nThe Nam Kao Tod- a crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausage, cilantro, green onions, ground dry chilies  ginger peanuts and lime juice was my favorite dish of the night. I'd never had anything like it before and all the components come together perfectly in every bite. Tip: Watch out of the dry peppers ;-)  \n\nFor my main dish the waiter recommend the Khao Soi a Burmese egg noddles coconut curry dish that was absolutely perfect. Creamy but not buttery, spicy but not overriding. Add the red onions and lime and it will take the dish to another level.\n\nSo next time you're in Vegas go hit the jackpot at Lotus of Siam!"

It should not matter what menu I order from, if something is served on the menu from a restaurant touted as the best in the United States, I shouldn't have to limit myself to a particular item or set of items to taste this quality.\n\nThe location, as others have mentioned, is absolutely horrible.  Off the strip on Sahara, it's hidden away in an area that makes me feel uncomfortable every time I go there.  The interior was nothing special and did not stand out to me...seemed quite unauthentic, way to strip-mallish, but alas I've never been to Thailand, I would not know what is truly authentic.  We happened to sit nearby a group who met with the owners, who both seemed nice but Bill was quite dressed down for whatever he was doing that evening (sweatshirt and sweatpants...not quite what I was expecting).  Like I've mentioned in other reviews, appearance and first impressions mean a lot when you eat out...much of the reason why many never come back.\n\nTo have to put so much into going here (reservations a week in advance or waiting a few hours if you come unannounced, I was expecting more.  The reviews here were for the most part spot on, but to each their own I suppose.  I came with high expectations and left wishing I'd never came."

Thanks to other Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered the Nam Kai Tod (crispy rice), Crispy Catfish with Apple, and Crispy duck with drunken noodles- note the \"Crispy\" theme here.  The first two dishes had so much flavor in one bite.  The Crispy Duck was good but the drunken noodles were so-so.  \nThere were so many enticing dishes on the menu but I did now have enough people to help me chow the food down.  These dishes will have to wait for me the next time I visit Vegas.  \n - Show up early for dinner if you want first seating. I visited this place on Saturday night, the door opened at 5:30PM, and all tables were filled by 6:00PM.\n- If you want a pleasant dining experience, bring a big party with you so that you can explore more items on the menu and show up when the door opens."

I ordered the yellow curry and spicy noodles with shrimp for my first take out order. The styrofoam box the noodles were in looked like it had been stepped on, their was sauce all over the bag and it leaked on my counter. After preparing my first plate of food I noticed a black and white hair in my food. My friend and I were disgusted because it looked like an animal hair. I immediately called back Lotus and told them I would be bringing the food back for a refund. When I went into the restaurant I showed them how sloppily they had packaged it and the unknown hair in my food. They said it was probably a hair from one of the girls clothing and I told them it looked like a cat hair. After this they handed me my money and I could see they wanted me out of their restaurant.\n\nFast forward a few months later, Lotus is still the closest Thai restaurant to my place and I don't like Komol. I told my friend I wanted to order take out again and she was completely surprised I wanted to give them another chance. I ordered the panang curry with vegetables and asked what vegetables were in the dish. Penny, the owners daughter said carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. I also ordered the Thai spaghetti with chicken. This time my order was packaged correctly but I noticed the panang curry was more oily than usual and contained very little sauce. I also saw that there was baby corn, various peppers, onions, and green beans. Penny described inaccurately what vegetables were in the dish. What if I was allergic? People need to be careful these days and not say things unless they are 100% sure. Both the panang curry and Thai spaghetti were a solid three stars, but after my shocking take out order and misdescribed dishes the most I can give this restaurant is two stars."

This is not a 'date place' in terms of dressing up.  Jeans are protocol here.\n\nThey also don't take reservations, which doesn't score any points with me.  Our waitress barely spoke English to the point where another one of the waiters had to assist with our table.  She also asked us if we liked cats????????????? Now when eating in an Asian restaurant we both thought this was extremely weird. Apparently, she had found a mother cat with babies and was trying to find them homes?????? At least that's what we hope.\n\nFood was pretty good, I wouldn't' say it's the best Thai food I've ever had, Sakun Thai is closer to me and just as good.\n\nI'm going to go back and try it again in case there's something I missed.

Unfortunately, the service after sitting down was rrrrreeeeaaaaaallllllyyyyyy ssssslllllloooooowwwww.\n\nFinally...the food was pretty good, although I wouldn't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had. Tried the nam kao tod mainly because the reviews (posted on the wall) seemed to rave about it. Freaking salty!!! We ate the cabbage (which seemed to be a garnish?) with it to cut the salt. Then had the tom yum soup, which was tasty, although also somewhat salty. For entrees, the braised shortribs with panang was very good, especially with sticky rice. And I really liked the rad na. It's always one of my favorite dishes, and they did it quite well. The pad thai was my least favorite entree, being...meh. They made up for it with the coconut ice cream dessert, though. It was yum!\n\nWhat can I say? I'll probably be back!"

I'll be dreaming of it until I return to Vegas.\n\nFood: 5\n\nTom Yum Noodle Soup: This was hands down the best version that we've ever had. The most important part is the broth, and they nailed it. The broth was flavorful but perfectly balanced. Their spiciness levels range from 1 to 10. We chose 5, and it was just mildly spicy. Spice wimps like me will feel some heat, but you might want to choose a higher number if you want spicy food as my mom didn't even realize it was spicy.\n\nPad See Ew with Chicken: This was a-okay. The chicken was well cooked, but the noodles lacked the char that I usually want in this dish. The portion is a tad small for the price.\n\nCrab Fried Rice: I told my mom that this fried rice was better than hers, and that's high praise. Fried rice usually entails rice that does not clump or stick together. The individual grains of rice must be separate, but that usually causes it to taste a little dry. Somehow, they've managed to make fried rice that is fluffy and soft but separate. The egg is also perfectly cooked so that it's fluffy and moist. There is also plenty of crab.\n\nNote: There food does lean towards the saltier side, but I don't mind.\n\nService: 4.5\n\nThe wait staff is polite and patient when you're ordering. I like that our waiter didn't hover over us throughout the entire meal yet he still managed to ensure that our water glasses were never empty. However, it is a little hard to flag someone down if you need something because they're so busy.\n\nAmbiance: 4.5\n\nThe restaurant is deceivingly large, but it somehow manages to procure a wait list. Don't fret over the waitlist! The hostess told me that the wait for our party of 3 would be about an hour, but we were seated within 20 minutes. There is also an extremely large parking lot, so you don't have to worry about that."

(if you want a buffet in vegas, eat at the rio!) there are tons and tons of items to try- all the more reason to come back. i think we ordered about 7-8 dishes and paid a little over 100, including tax and tip. we were only a party of 3! now that is good dining!\r\n\r\nthe location and the setting isnt what you would expect of the restuarant. it's off the strip (which is a good and bad thing), located in a plaza. just dont judge a book by its cover. come hungry and talk to the owner if he's there. he's a really nice guy!"

The prawn was so finger licking good that I can probably just eat the shells all day long!  The sausage was flavorful and the wings were crisp!!!

            "review": "This restaurant was recommended to us by a local friend. He said it was the best Thai in Vegas, hands down. It's located in an economically--and otherwise--depressed strip mall. (There's a bedraggled \"Adult Day Care\" two doors down with a flickering, half-lit neon sign. Love you, mom and dad.) I'm not complaining about that, though. In my experience if a local tells you that something's the best and it's in a terrible location, you're usually in for a real treat. So I was actually getting more excited. \n\nA few of our party were under 5 minutes late and the staff acted like they were doing us a favor by seating us. They were very busy, but we *did* have reservations. \n\nWhen the waiter came by, he was very much in a hurry. As a NYer, I don't generally have a problem with that, but I rarely see a waiter rush like that, with no effort to be hospitable at all. The guy who filled our waters was far more personable and helpful. \n\nI ordered the Massaman Curry, which is a standard/classic dish. When I got it it wasn't hot, but warm verging on room temperature and it sat there cooling more as we waited several minutes for the rice to arrive. When I tasted it, the flavors were great, but there was no spice at all. The waiter didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it and I didn't ask because usually at a Thai place, they just give you 'medium spice for an American' if you don't specify. \n\nThe prices were very decent and more inline with their location than their apparent popularity, which is good. \n\nLocals seem to love this place, so maybe I just had bad luck. It happens. But based on my experience, the place gets two stars."

            "review": "We made a concerted effort to dine in this restaurant, due to all the high praise and feedback from patrons, as well as its \"appearance\" on Top Chef.  We made a reservation [quite late in the evening, but it worked with our schedule].  We were brimming with anticipation, driving to our fantastic dinner experience!\n\nThe location is in a strip mall, which is OK, as some fabulous gems are hidden away.  The entrance was quite tiny, and people had to rub shoulders to squeeze in or out of the restaurant.  We were seated in the large room, which resembled more  a cafeteria environment than a fine restaurant.  That was not what I envisioned.  We requested to be reseated, and were: in the front room, but at a table which was situated precisely between the 2 paths to and from the small dining annex , so there was a constant movement of diners and servers, non stop.  Fine, we settled down.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer of the Thai papaya salad, and spicy squid, along with a bottle of chilled white wine: Vermentino Litorale 2010 - crisp, \"snappy\", pungent.  But went so well with the spicy thai cusine. They DO have a fantastic wine selection: the \"cellar\" is housed behind a thick glass wall, so all can see the abundant wine offerings.  \n\nThe papaya salad was deceptively simple, yet very complex in flavors - a joy for the palate.  The squid salad was fabulously delicious, but extremely spicy: enjoy, but beware! I met my match in heat levels, and had to succumb to the help of thai tea with milk, to quench the inferno in my mouth.\n\nFor the main course, we selected pad ke mao with prawns, and crispy duck in cognac sauce.  My pad ke mao was awful!! The noodles were oily, hard and stuck together - clearly the dish sat a while under the heating lamps.  The prawns were absolutely bland, deep fried, and warm on the outside and cool in the center, from sitting too long.  I sent it back: it's an embarrassment to bring this quality of food to a diner!  They brought a fresh one: much better, but still missing the mark on prawn flavor.\n\nThe crispy duck dish was beautiful in presentation and taste: the crispy skin contrasted with succulent duck meat, surrounded by the delicious sauce with clear notes of coconut & peanut, and perfectly seasons for flavor and heat.  It was excellent, with the plain steamed rice.\n\nFor dessert we were dreaming of mango and sticky rice..... None to be had.  How disappointing.\n\nOverall, this dining experience was a three out of four: the service felt rushed, and yet my first dish clearly sat for a long time before being served; the restaurant is extremely noisy - quite difficult to carry on a conversation at regular decibel level; lack of staple Thai dessert was very disappointing; and the seating arrangements leave a lot to be desired - at least for me."

We were unaware that they had a buffet special and came after the buffet hours were over. Not sure what the buffet deal is anyways.\n\nOrdered the beef larb, because my favorite promoter, Bhagya of Marquee, raved about how good it was. I thought it would come with rice but it doesn't. It's okay though. Very flavorful, nonetheless. We also order the traditional Pad Thai, in which it was not super oily. Thank gosh, because we all know I don't like oily Pad Thai. We also ordered soup but I forgot what kind it was. The Panang was very creamy and filled with veggies and meat. They don't cheap out. \n\nPricing wise, not bad for Vegas food. I can see why my promoter liked the place so much. They were very attentive and there were a lot of waiters/waitresses when we were there. It is located inside a plaza, so keep a look out. Lots of parking due to a huge parking lot that is full of empty space. Worth trying if you're ever in Vegas.\n\nOH! And if you and your girls need a Vegas promoter for clubs, message me. :)"

The Tom Yum Kai was spiced perfectly, it had the right amount of kick but still retained its sour lime flavor. I wish I had ordered the Yellow Curry in a 8, it was not spicy at all, but the coconut base was still good. This was the first time I had Sticky Rice and i really enjoyed the firm yet soft and sticky texture. I'll be ordering it often. The mint and chili beef was my favorite dish, it was a great mixture of flavors and spices that hits the mouth at all angles. Stuffed chicken wings?...c'mon, so bomb. How is it even possible to make!? It defies the laws of physics and gravity. LOL.  It was very tasty. The thai iced tea was perfect, not too sweet, and very refreshing. \n\nOverall, possibly the best Thai meal i've ever had. It did not break the bank either. We spent about $53 with tip.

In contrast to most of the buffets in Vegas, Lotus of Siam does not leave their buffet dishes under heat lamps for hours.  Each dish is fresh.  Hell, there's not much chance for the dishes to sit for long since the place is always packed for lunch and the kitchen needs to keep cranking out food to refill the buffet options.  \n\nOh, and the buffet dishes are properly cooked.  An overcooked chicken can ruin a Pad Thai, but you won't find that here.  It's tender, it's seasoned and it's wonderful.\n\nAnd they do a good job of catering to the full spectrum of spice lovers.  The dishes on the buffet aren't overly spicy, but there's plenty of hot sauce and dried hot pepper to stir in if you want to raise the heat level.\n\nAll around thumbs up."

We ordered the Tom Yum Prawn Soup, Panang Curry with Chicken, Garlic Prawns, Khao Soi Braised Short Ribs, Sea Bass with Gnger, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves.

            "review": "This place has THE BEST Thai food I've had. EVER. And I've had some good Thai food in Cali! 6 out of 5 stars, unofficially. The menu is HUGE, if only I could eventually get to every single one. That would be quite a feat...hmm...new blog ideas brewing. I had the very wonderful fortune of going with veterans of ordering at Lotus of Siam. I don't think I even opened the menu! They just knew exactly what to order, and I merely sat, anticipating each dish to enjoy.\n\nIn all seriousness, though...this place is beyond awesome. All the dishes we ordered were great! Make sure you know your spice levels. I LOVE spicy food, even if it hurts later. Just deal with it, folks.\n\nMy favorite: Tom Yum Kai -- the Tom Yum soup with chicken. WOW. It was the perfect amount of lemongrass and spice. I think by the end, it was a little spicy for us...but just make sure to pace yourself. I love putting some rice in my soup to help balance out the textures and also the spiciness. If you really like the lemongrass taste and the spice, get like a medium level spice (maybe something like a 5) and enjoy! This soup came out with the papaya salad (review of it down below), which was a little too much spice all at once. I saved some of my papaya salad to eat with the other dishes, since that's just a little too much spiciness to have together without anything else to balance it out.\n\nWhat else we ordered (EVERYTHING was delicious):\n\nCrispy duck: wow, it was very crispy and flavorful! Loved this dish, will definitely get it again next time. I see that a lot of people order this as a curry dish. I wonder if it makes a difference in the flavor of the duck itself, or even the curry itself? Well we had already ordered a separate curry noodle dish, so I guess I'm pretty happy with this choice. It keeps the integrity of the crunch and makes it crispy longer, that way. \n\nGarlic prawns: OK, so speaking of crispy. Holy Crispy Crunchy Crackling Goodness, Batman! Cap'n Crunch is put to shame. This is seriously one of the THE BEST crispy prawns I've had. I don't normally eat the shell of prawns, but I ate every tiny little crunchy bite of this prawn down to the tail. Oh my goodness, that's how good it is. Another great idea I had: make this into a bag of \"chips\" and I would buy the whole factory. For reals, though. Could someone please come up with that? It's nothing like the Shrimp flavored snacks that you find in Asian markets. This would have to replicate the crunch and flavor of this exact garlic prawn dish. Do it and let me know. \n\nBraised beef short ribs over noodles: I actually can't remember how this dish was...I think I was too busy with the other stuff above...Ooops. I guess I won't be ordering this dish next time LOL. \n\nPapaya Salad: I don't know why I'm adding this at the end, even though it was one of the first dishes that came out. It was really good and fresh, as far as papaya salads go. I feel like this dish was a little overpowered by all the other dishes, so I'm sorry that this became like the poor neglected pet who gets shoo-ed away when a new baby arrives in the family. \n\nI think I've written enough now. I hope you guys enjoy this place as much as I did! I really can't wait to go back..."

Dishes can be small but that can be an excuse for your party to try more things. You won't regret it.\n\nDon't confuse this place with some of those Thai places that try to be gourmet but stray too far from authenticity. This is real deal, gourmet Thai cuisine. Take it from me or not but I am Thai and have been to Thailand many times and I think I agree with the writer from Gourmet Magazine that this is \"The best Thai food in North America\". I 'll even go as far as saying it is better than most restaurants in Thailand.\n\nThe service id good, plating is nice and decor is pretty crappy but it doesn't really matter when the food is this good.\n\nPrice $20-30 per person for dinner. \n\nIt's located in a dodgy strip-mall consisting of massage parlors and shady looking bars, restaurants and all the riff -raff they attract but I'll gladly dodge a few bullets to eat here again.\n\nI give Lotus of Siam 5 stars based on the taste and quality of it's food. I usually reserve this for ultra elegant, flawless in all ways, destination restaurants. I will make the exception because this place is truly in a league of it's own because of how far the taste and quality exceeds that of any other Thai restaurant I have been to in the United States."

Unless you are willing to wait a hour. We were seated at a nice table in their second section and was promptly served by a waiter. This waiter was clearly busy was still coming at perfect times during our dine in experience. We got the garlic prawns and drunken noodles with crispy duck. The stuffed chicken was amazing though! Definitely recommended that! They were both delicious however a bit overpriced. Maybe if they up the furniture and the front door upon walking in with the waiting room I would be a bit more at ease paying for this $$$ restaurant. This being a hole in a wall clearly had potential for greatness. The owner was very kind and overall food and service was great. 4/5 due to  it being a bit overpriced."

            "review": "I've been visiting Las Vegas for nearly a decade now, and I started to hear rave reviews for Lotus of Siam on my second or third trip.  I love Thai food, but didn't get a chance to dine here until we had a car to drive off-Strip to the back of a sketchy strip mall.  I wasn't put off by the location (I love a good dive), but it didn't seem like somewhere I really wanted to catch a cab.\n\nWe visited at lunchtime, tired and hungry from early-morning flights, and decided to hit the buffet.  I think this was our critical error.  The majority of the 5-star reviews here are for their menu service, not the buffet.  But we were starving and the limited options on the buffet seemed like a reasonable trade-off for instant gratification.  I wish we'd looked at the buffet before agreeing to be seated in the dining area around it - one glance and I think we would've opted for the menu dining room instead.\n\nIt was a small buffet and very little on it was Thai cuisine.  Mostly, it offered the typical Pan-Asian dishes you find on cheap buffets - rice, lots of stir-fried veggies and meats, some noodles, some broth-y soups, sliced fruit, crispy fried appetizer things, etc.  The Pad Thai and a veggie dish were the only recognizably \"Thai\" dishes out there, the rest were pretty uninteresting.  Nothing seemed particularly well-made or seasoned, either.  The highlight of the buffet was the fried banana wontons.  We ate so many of those once we discovered how mediocre everything else was.  \n\nI'm sad to give Lotus of Siam a 2-star review, but the buffet doesn't deserve anything higher even if you're dining in a room literally lined in photos of the celebrity guests who have dined there (and a gigantic glassed-in wine cellar, which was incongruous with the buffet).  I'd be interested to return for a real menu dining experience.  I don't often give second chances to places that let me down this badly, but I know I must be missing something here."

            "review": "Heard a lot of great things about this place and finally decided to check it out. It's located in an odd spot in one of Vegas's older strip malls... if you're dining here at night you're in for an adventure, there's definitely a lot of unique neighbors. I came here on a Thursday night at 8:45pm with two of my friends. They were pretty busy but not packed and we were able to get seated immediately.\n\nIt was an interesting place; in the middle of the restaurant they had a huge wine selection concealed behind a glass wall. Additionally like a lot of popular asian restaurants there always seems to be more Americans than asian patrons. \n\nAnyways... after we were seated our server Jim, (I don't think that was his real name), was a phenomenal guy. He must have been working there for a while because he knew everything and anything about the menu! Jim made some great recommendations from the menu and always checked back to see if we were doing fine. \n\nWe ended up ordering quite a bit of food, but my favorites were #14. Nam Kao Tod, which was rice flavored with lemon, it was very savory and #13B Moo Dad Dew, which was the best beef jerky I've ever had.\n\nOverall it wasn't a bad experience. I would rate this place 3/5 but we ended up finding hair in the drunken rice and that was an immediate red flag. Especially the way the server had handled the issue. Our other server, (not Jim), wasn't even sure how to go about it. His first response was to bring us a new plate; we pretty much had to send back the entire dish until they removed it from our check.\n\nWe ended up spending $44 for 3 people. (That was after the drunken rice was taken off of our bill).\n\nLotus of Siam is definitely your typical mom & pop shop, there were handwritten \"out of order signs\" on paper place mats near the restrooms and you could clearly see the cleaning supplies in the restroom. Also the seating in the restaurant is a bit crowded, there's tables randomly scattered everywhere. You can literally place your arm on someone else's table if your not careful!\n\nTips: This place is a bit overhyped, the food isn't bad but it's like any other traditional Thai restaurant just with more reviews."

The shrimp is taken out of the shell but they include the shell as part of your dish. They cook the shrimp shell to a perfect crisp, almost like eating a chip. \n\nKhai Soi - $8.95 - also very good. It's noodles in a curry sauce, almost like a soup \n\nTom Kah Kai - $4.95 cup - the best darn soup ever!!! It's very similar to tom yum soup but with coconut milk and a little spicier too. Mouth watering goodness and def. a must order!\n\nDeep Fried Sea Bass - $28.95 - very good but in my opinion, pretty small for the price. It's deep fried in some kind of a chili sauce.\n\nI highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back. The service was great, atmosphere was great, and the food....yum, FANTASTIC!"

For my birthday, I'd thought to treat my family to a place I've heard extensive publicity about. All of the reviews and pictures seemed to give it proper accolades so it was a must to eat there. We only waited 15 minutes, they sat us down, and we looked through the menu. We ordered our dinner, talked amongst each other about what we did during the day, and we waited. Once the food was out, the aroma made us happy and we began to eat. I thought the nam prik ong was supposed to arrive first like how I asked but I can eat it after my red curry. We ate slowly and still talked amongst each other. It was going well until we seen the servers standing by us, asking if we were done with our meals. Obviously if you stop eating to chat, the assumption of you being done seems questionable. But these welcoming men turned into vultures, constantly asking if we were finished. Their smiling demeanor turned into angst that made everyone uncomfortable. I took my time to finish my meal while they where practically begging us to ask for the check. I finished my red curry but I was still waiting for my nam prik ong. The server who took my order asked if he could clean the table while I surfed the web for places to go after. He asked politely if I can scoot over so they could rearrange the tables too. My family is waiting outside and I'm waiting for my other half that I ordered. I finally ask the man about it and he seemed hazed as if I was the one who decided to order at that very last minute. He even insisted on pulling out my chair so I could leave but I told him directly again about my order. I can see the sweat on his forehead as he wrote it down again. While I waited again, I can see everyone else was having a different experience. I saw the beautiful menu throughout the restaurant from what people had ordered. And I saw the money hungry people who run the place. I never want to feel like there's a price on my head again. I never ever want the servers to make it obvious that they're \"losing money\" because of our warmth as a family to chat amongst each other. I ate the red chili dip and left. My question is, how much did they pay you Anthony Bourdain and Action Bronson? How much did they pay you to say those kind words? That this is one of the greatest places to eat in Las Vegas. I hate this place. I will never eat there again."

Why else would semi-inebriated foodies from around the country quietly ask their cab drivers to drive down E Sahara blvd for dinner.  \"The Sahara hotel miss?\" - no cabbie, I said the creepy dilapidated shopping center on Sahara Blvd next to the discount wig shop.  \n\nOnce you enter LOS the restaurant itself is much nicer than the location would suggest, and the waitstaff could not be nicer or more attentive.  Best bets include the crispy rice with sour sausage appetizer.  It is literally a party in your mouth - so many different textures and tastes.  There are a bunch of fresh herbs, deliciously crispy rice, cubes of sour sausage, cucumbers, peanuts, chillies, and red onion.  I only wish they would serve it in a giant cereal bowl with a big wooden spoon.  I also love their chicken wings with garlic and pepper.  They are so crispy and addictive, a perfect starter.  For main courses I love all their noodles and curry.  Friends have raved about the scallops as well.  However my favorite dish came on my last visit and was the drunken noodles with giant prawns.  The noodles were wide and spicy atop of lettuce and had a huge portion of perfectly fried shrimp on top.  The dish was amazing if no a bit pricey at $20 - but the portion was very large and included 8 prawns.  \n\nFinally the perfect ending is the mango, sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I do not exaggerate when I say this is my favorite dessert of all time.  I have never had better mangoes than those I have at LOS.  Legend says that the chef rejects 75% of the mangoes they receive because they do not meet his standards.  They are the most perfect and sweet mangoes you will ever have.  Best of all, the fine staff at LOS will call a cab for you as you are finishing dessert so that your transportation is waiting for you at the end of your meal.  Truly a wonderful experience, and well worth the cab ride off the Vegas strip."

            "review": "A friend suggested this place when I was out here in Vegas. OF course when I first heard of it I was excited but skeptical due to the wait time and hoping it is not just a hype place. I arrived around 545pm on a Sunday night and people were already seated enjoying their food. The hostess told me the wait time was 2 hours. oh boy, theres always tat decision to whether find something else or to wait. We decided to put our name down and the hostess told us there is a waiting room in the back. They also have the app where we enter our phone numbers and they would let us know when the table is ready. We also were able to see the wait time on the website thats linked to their app. GENUIS ! The waiting room definitely made waiting more bearable. About 3 hours later we finally got our table. We already decided on which dishes we were going to order. \n\nGarlic Pawns: of course were a must ! This came in about 6/8 pieces and the whole shrimp including the shrimp was edible, just make sure you chew slowly. \n\nCrispy Duck ( Khao Soi): I have never had this before at a thai restaurant but it was so good! Definitely need to eat this with rice. The dish was full of flavors and it all complimented well with one another. \n\nTom Kah Kai:(hot pot for the bigger portion) I love Thai soup! this had coconut base to it and it was so delicious. the cream of the coconut balanced the sourness of the soup. highly recommend ordering this soup dish. \n\nThai fried rice: this one was okay,  I wish I chose a more exciting fried rice. \n\nThai Spagettii: We had a party of 6 so we each had to get a little bit to try. The noodles were cooked to al dente and the flavors of the sauce was gentle and not overly powered by it. \n\nFried stuff chicken: this was an interesting dish. It was stuffed with mushrooms/ chicken/ and veggies. The sauce it came with was what topped off the dish. \n\nNam Kao Tod: This is the duck curry.. let me tell ya ...I wish they had a bucket of the curry ! The dish came with some noodles but of course wishing they added more. The curry sauce was so good over rice. This dish was not overpowered by the curry and the duck was good perfectly so where it was soft. The curry flavor was infused in to the duck pieces. \n\nHad a little room for dessert so we opted for the Fried Banana with coconut ice cream. The banana was fried in what seem like the skin of an egg roll and topped with some cold creamy coconut ice cream! The temperature of the banana was perfect to add the ice cream on top. perfect crunch/ sweetness / and goodness. \n\nHighly recommend if you can make reservations to this place! \nBE patient during wait time because I can tell you it is WORTH IT if you love thai food."

This is a shame because the flavor is still there. \n\nI wish they wouldn't skimp out on the servings like the crispy duck dishes or would add more noodles to the noodle dishes. I feel like they are just mass producing since they are turning tables constantly throughout the night. \n\nOverall I would come again but only if making a reservation is easy. Not worth it to do a walk-in, which will cost you 60-75 minutes of time waiting."

Well the inside is not that impressive either, then you notice the huge amount of celeb photos on the walls. Their wine list is over 100 pages. Service is outstanding! Food was definitely outstanding and worth it, even overlooking the decor. We had the Garlic Prawns and drunken noodles that was great.

            "review": "Funny story, Lotus of Siam when you drive by from Sahara looks like a hole in the wall broken down place that you would never want to eat at. On 2 different occassions I planned on going there and both times when I drove by we decided to go somewhere else. About a year ago we bit the bullet and decided to try it. Surprisingly enough the front of the restaraunt is in the back and we were basically looking at the back of the place when driving by. It can be deceiving. I've been there 1/2 dozen times since. Last night we went and there was a 1 hour - 1.5 hour wait to get seated. The foods so good we waited over an hour.\n\nI've read reviews from more than one food critic calling is the best Thai Food in all of North America. I've been to Thailand for a month to train and the food is actually better at Lotus of Siam! The owner apparently started cooking in Thailand at age 5 with her mother/grandmother and brough that experience to Vegas. Just yesterday I saw on Yahoo that Lotus of Siam was #89 on the list of the best 101 restaraunts in the USA.\n\nAs for the food, some things I recommened for an appetizer are the Prawns in a blanket, spicy chilli chicken wings and also the Tom Kah Kai Soup. For dessert the Mango Sticky Rice is the bomb. \n\nI went with 3 people total and for our main courses to split we got Crispy garlic prawns, Panang Curry and Sea bass over drunken noodles. I've had numerous dishes here and they are all good. All the curries are great, the pad thai, the crispy duck. Great flavors and taste you wont find many other places. I see myself going back very soon!"

            "review": "I remember reading a food blogger's thoughts on eating at Thai vs Chinese restaurants.  EXCELLENT Chinese cuisine is a rare find, but you will be hard pressed to find a bad Thai joint.  Excluding some specialty items, the general menu tastes like common Thai fare.  We had the Nam Prik Ong (it is an Asian version of crudit\u00e9s served with a shrimp paste which is fishy, salty and sweet, very similar to the Filipino Bagoong), A Pork BBQ dish, Green Curry and Phad Thai.  I enjoyed other places' versions better (eeep).  Although their prices are cheap, very reasonable.\n\nI guess what really sets this place apart is its impressively extensive wine list.  From a humble entrance with waiting times lasting up to 2 hours, you are greeted by a large cellar filled with wine from around the world.  I'm not sure how these pair perfectly with Thai cuisine but I'm thinking any wine aficionado will enjoy this visit.  So go for the lobster, sea bass and German wine.  Otherwise, you can always get seated immediately at the numerous Thai options in Vegas.\n\nWant to see some food porn? :-) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=Pc4P-W9mUQou5gbz5ps4Wg#Pc4P-W9mUQou5gbz5ps4Wg"

            "review": "We almost didn't try this place but I am so happy we did! Possibly because I had this thought in my head that Thai food can't be much different from the many places that we already tried back home in Hawaii...or maybe it was because my friend who introduced us to some of our favorite Thai food places back home didn't care for this place much.  I am so glad that we ended up here regardless of the reasons pointing elsewhere because I really really enjoyed it. Since they are \n\nLOCATED near the airport (South side of the strip). It was convenient and the timing was right. \n\nFOOD - GREAT - We always order the same food items when trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time. It's basically so I can compare the taste. It's also our favorite dishes. \n\nEgg Roll/Spring Roll - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#30s9CUJHF-BaOe0FWkX9nQ I asked for Spring Roll and he said they call it egg roll here. This confused me as I always thought that Vietnamese and Thai call theirs spring rolls but he said they don't use the rice paper wrap. Didn't matter, I enjoyed it. Rice paper wrap, egg dough..whatever... it came out hot, it was crispy and had great filling. \n\nPad Thai Noodle W/Chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#skkyJU6psgsiM0M_AqMO9g I was very impressed with this dish. The noodles did not stick together, it was not too oily, and it had a very rich and strong peanut flavor. It also had the right amount of acidity to balance out the richness. This was one of the better pad Thai dishes that I have eaten. \n\nPanang Curry W/Beef - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#LhgLajbztEVV4jVr_ggEvQ We normally order panang curry or yellow curry but lately we been choosing panang more than yellow. Probably because panang is richer and creamier in flavor, and that is exactly what we got with this dish. They don't give a lot but you don't need a lot since this dish is packed with flavor.  \n\nSpice levels are based on a scale of 1-10 and we got level 7. This is about as high as I would like it to go here. Any higher and it would have probably killed the taste for me. \n\nThe ENVIRONMENT here was very pleasant. Although it was very crowded, we didn't feel claustrophobic because they have lots of tables and are properly spaced out. The size of this place is a pretty decent size. We were even able to bring in our stroller. \n\nThe SERVICE is good. As soon as we entered our hostess took us to a table to accommodate our stroller. A huge plus in my book. Our server also had proper knowledge and took care of us in a timely manner. I just wish he would have been a little happier but I can't dock them just on that. \n\nThe OVERALL price for the quality of food here is totally worth it. I enjoyed the entire experience and I have to give this place 5 stars."

This better be some damn good thai food.  20 bucks is like a whole hand of blackjack and that means a lot to my asian blood.\n\nAnyhoot, we arrive at a non-descript strip mall in the middle of no where.  I didn't even notice the restaurant and asked the cab driver 'Are you sure this is it?' because he dropped us off at an indian restaurant next door to lotus of siam.  we finally walk in and instantly surprised by the size and decor of the place.  it's got a nice wine section and the restaurant was packed for a Sat night.  Reservations only so call ahead to be sure they have space.\n\nOn to the food.  Literally the best mussaman curry I've ever had.  I'd pay that same 9 or 10 dollars just for the curry sauce with a bowl of white rice.  just enough heat on the curry and the beef was super tender.  We also the old stand by pad see ew, except this was the best I've ever had.  noodles still had nice life to them (weren't sauteed until it was mush) and the greens were fresh and crunchy with a tart bite.  Loved those two plates.  We had also had the garlic shrimp and beef salad.  both were very good, but not outstanding like the pad see ew and mussaman curry.  The weakest dish was the appetizer.  It was the nam kao tod (the crispy rice appetizer everyone raves about).  It was ok/good for me.  Has a strong salty/sour flavor component with the crispy rice texture.  Good when eaten with the garnish, but still overpowering with the salt.\n\nOverall, awesome thai food.  Take a couple of green chips from the blackjack table and stash them away in your pocket.  might be fun gambling it on cards, but for that same amount of cash, you're guaranteed some awesome thai food off the strip and that's a win in of itself."

Ah, the good old days (circa 2007!), when I had the kind of free time that would allow me to wait an hour to be seated for lunch! Yes, the most memorable part about the experience was definitely the wait time.\n\nBy the time I got a table, I was famished and impatient and opted for the lunch buffet. Nothing stood out as particularly mind-blowing, but none of the limited dishes were bad either. I believe there was a minced chicken dish, rice, a veggie noodle option, chicken wings and a few soups along side some salads and condiments. I filled up and left satisfied, but felt no overwhelming need to return immediately.\n\nBased on the other reviews and mouth-watering user photos, I know I will need to try again, probably for dinner, and order some of the more exciting options. I suck at advance planning- come to think of it, I did try to come back twice and found the place closed once and a line halfway down the block the other- but I do think LOS warrants another trip sooner rather than later."

We shared an appetizer of veggies with chili paste, seabass with drunken noodles, and Crispy duck with panang curry(coconut curry). \n\nThe veggies with chili paste was surprisingly good. The chili gave the veggies a lot of taste to it. the seabass was fried and we decided to combine it w/ the drunken noodles. I thought the seabass was very good as it was seasoned well, cooked perfectly, while the fish is not dry at all and the crispy skin made it awesome. However, I was probably the only one but I thought the noodles was a bit endante? kinda hard ? I felt like it wasn't soft enough or cook long enough for some reason and that threw me off just a little. It wasn't too big of an issue but it was my little thing that I had to criticize about it. Finally we have the crispy duck w/ panang curry. YOU have to make sure you get steam rice w/ this(order separately)  or else you're not doing this dish justice. Have some rice, put the sauce on top, grab a crispy duck(which they cut for you) and my god it is wonderful. I never had \"crispy duck\" before but it was awesome. \n\nTook out a star because I thought the dishes were kinda luke warm which is a bit disappointing and I also think it's overpriced especially for how much they give you(which isn't that much imo). I would definitely still recommend you guys to try Lotus of Siam because these unique dishes are wonderful and if you had to choose one dish to get here...make sure you get the crispy duck with panang curry!"

Then after we got seated, we had to wait for ~20 min to get our order taken.  We ordered Tom Yum Kai soup, Chicken Sa-Tay as an appetizer, yellow curry, and pad thai.  \n\nAfter 30 min, the soup was finally served.  It tasted good, it was not hot.  It was warm.. but not HOT.  I need my soup HOT.  Then the sa-tay was served.  It was very good.  \n\nIt took them FOREVER to bring the main dishes.  The curry I thought was just average..   But the pad thai was excellent.

I was really disappointed in the warm soup.  I will probably go back to the Thai restaurant we usually go to the next time we are in town."

YELPers have given them a 4-STAR, it made it on Chef Ming's Best I've Ever Had list, so I thought we would LOVVVE it.  Alas, we did not love it. :(\n\nIt is partially my fault.  Going against everything sacred about my fooding skills, we opted for the lunch buffet instead of ordering off the menu.  It wasn't a matter of cost, more a matter of variety.  I thought this would be the best way for us to try a plethora of dishes and see what the restaurant had to offer!  FAIL.\n\nThere were a couple of items that were very good, the tom  yum soup was spicy, fragrant and steaming with deliciousness.  Everything else available was slightly subpar, from the dried out, overcooked chicken wings (not spicy at all by the way) to the pad thai that simply tasted like stir fried rice noodles.  I was disappointed.  There was a really yummy egg omelet with tomatoes and onions that i could've eaten alone with just steamed rice-but that shouldnt be the highlight for a place like this.\n\nLike I said, it was probably my fault for not ordering dishes that had been recommended by others.

I eat everything spicy!! I would opt for 6 or 7 next time.\nGarlic prawns- They were charred a bit, butterflied open and delicious!! Definitely would order this again!!\nPad thai-  It was too sweet, didn't like it.\nPork satay- The meat was so soft and juicy and dipping sauce was very good.\nNua yum katium 6-  This is most likely what I know as \"crying tiger\".  It was okay but I don't think we will order this again etiher.  \n\nI will say that the food was wonderful... once you get it.

It was rather sketchy, not just by its looks but in actuality, if one were to go with Lotus of Siam and the Las Vegas police's notice to their patrons that asks them not to leave valuables in cars. We came twenty minutes after they opened for Saturday lunch, and there was already a fifteen-minute wait. The waiting area is rather intimate and I was truly thankful that we were able to sit in there instead of having to wait outside and experience the dry desert heat (already in the mid-80's at around 11 AM). However, we took advantage of this little wait to look up their menu and see what looks particularly appetizing.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and were evidently used to handling their many visitors. We hardly had to wait for anything during our visit: the water glasses were refilled promptly, the food arrived in about ten minutes, and the check was given to us within five minutes of finishing our meal. Really, if I was a little nervous about grumpy service due to their popularity, my nervousness was misplaced.\n\nNow to the food. For our appetizer, we tried the tod mun plar, which is a popular Thai street food. It was delicious. We were able to taste the fish without getting that unpleasant fishy flavor lingering in our palate after consumption. Even the daughter, who is not a fan of fish that does not come in fish and chips form, enjoyed the tod mun plar. It was a great omen for the rest of our meal.\n\nFor entr\u00e9e, we had the northern larb, kang care, and crispy duck with panang sauce to eat with their combination fried rice. Everything was perfectly spiced and absolutely delicious. The northern larb is on the spicy side, so if you are not into spicy, maybe skip it. But if you like spicy food that offer complexity of flavors that go beyond the piquant, the northern larb will not disappoint. The kang care also delivered  and may be one of the best curries I have ever had.\n\nThe crispy duck with panang sauce from the chef's selection was undeniably the star of our meal. It was pricey, but it worked hard for every single cent of our hard-earned money. The duck was seasoned well and cooked perfectly that it did not get soggy even if it sat in the sauce it came with. But that sauce was unforgettable. It was very flavorful and just fantastic. My cousin and I had a \"friendly\" argument, which I lost, as to who can take the sauce home to eat with just plain steamed rice. Seriously, it was so delicious, I would be happy to eat that with nothing else but steamed rice for days on end and call myself a lucky girl. That good.\n\nThe fried rice was good, but I would suggest settling for steamed rice instead because it is rather heavy. I would prefer eating more of their delicious entr\u00e9e rather than fried rice. While it did not disappoint, I was rather resentful of our choice to order it because I should have known better, what with my limited stomach space and all.\n\nThe food is on the pricey side and the servings are on the small side, but if you are in Las Vegas and want to go beyond the buffets they are justifiably famous for and want to go where locals go, do go to Lotus of Siam."

I was very impressed with the food and service. Based on Anthony Bourdain's recommendations on his TV show, I skipped right past the first dozen pages or so and went directly to the \"Northern Specialty\" pages. My party ordered the Khoa Soi, Red Chili Dip, and the Northern Larb. The waiter asked us how spicy we preferred on a scale of 1-10. Now I pride myself on enjoying very spicy food, but the #7 level of spicy really made me sweat. My table also ordered a sticky rice for every person at the table. DEFINITELY GET THE STICKY RICE. I wish I'd saved more room that day and ordered more at LoS, because the food was fantastic. In fact, I may need to push up my next trip to LV in order to get back to LoS ASAP!"

I'm blown away by the level of execution and consistency of their dishes.\" (http://www.lamag.com/features-hidden/2013/05/16/vegas-chefs-choice) \n\nReally now mister fancy chef dude? With all of the top notch Thai places in LA that is a rather bold statement and I decided I must witness such cuisine myself. \n\nMy wife and I are in Vegas and we decide to make the trek from the strip to this place that is located in an oddball shopping center. We saw the place and were skeptical... we walked in and our nostrils were immediately welcomed by delicious Thai aromas. Skepticism melted away as we walked past the bunch of people waiting around for a table. We put our name down and the wait was long - I wish we had made a reservation. That right there folks is the only gripe I have.\n\nWhen the hostess took us to our table she warned us that since they are busy the wait for our food might be lengthy. At that point we had already invested too much time to turn back and after looking at all of the yelp reviews we were ready to try this stuff, so that warning did not detour us. We were then greeted by a friendly waiter and he took our drink and food orders efficiently. The hostess' warning turned out to be unnecessary as our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time. \n\nOkay, enough semantics. The FOOD. Oh, the glorious food. The drunken noodles with soft-shell crab were stunning. I took the first bite and I felt my eyes pop out of my head. The flavors were so amazing! Then the panang curry with crispy duck was unbelievable. I've had \"crispy duck\" before and never, never in my life has it been as delightfully crispy as it is here. Perfection!  \n\nMy wife and I dine at some pretty spectacular places when we are in Vegas and we have talked about this meal more than any other. I will certainly be returning to this place each and every time I go to Vegas. So, yes. Mister fancy chef dude's bold statement is absolutely valid. Yes, I too am blown away by their amazing Thai food!"

I would definitely try to make a reservation or come during off hours because during those busy dinner hours (haven't tried going during lunch yet) this place gets PACKED and you'll have to wait a while. \n\nBasically, you should go ahead and try everything on the menu. I've had a lot of different dishes and they were all delicious. I would trust this place to make everything taste good, it's THAT good. \n\nOne thing to beware, however, is if you can't eat spicy foods or you don't like pungent foods. Thai food generally has strong flavors because they use lots of herbs and spices and fish sauce pretty liberally. This place takes that to the next level. The flavors are very strong. Also, if you can't eat spicy foods, be careful here. I love spicy foods and prefer my food to be very very spicy (basically, the more it burns/hurts the better it tastes lol) and when we came here, even though we didn't ever specify spicy level, most of the foods came out pretty spicy. Their papaya salad was surprisingly very spicy. So just be careful. If you can't eat spicy, make sure to tell them that."

Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head because of all the rave reviews and also the long line waiting outside even before the restaurant opened.\n\nWe got basically most of the popular items.\nDrunken noodles with sea bass, we asked for level 7 spicy and it had a good kick and the sea bass was very moist and tender with it. However, for almost an $30 dish, it was not very much  noodles and just barely enough fish for our group of 4 to split.\nCrispy Duck Kha Soi (Sp?), this was a creamy coconut based sauce with egg noodles and crispy duck. I have to say, the duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, the noodles was good too, especially coated in the sauce. Again for the price of $25 it was barely enough noodles to split between 4 people.\nThe fried shrimp everyone seemed to get. I do love how crispy the shells are, completely edible and full of shrimp flavor. It looks like a big plate of 10+ shrimp, but it's more like actual shrimp meat is 4-5 pieces and the rest of just shell. \nThe spicy chicken wings were just OK, tastes like Costco wings tossed in the Asian sweet chili sauce, would skip next time.\nWe got the red chili dip, it was very smokey but that was about the only flavor it really had, not a fan of this one either.\nOrdered a curry dish, it didn't have coconut milk and was another one lacking in flavor, didn't finish this dish because it just didn't taste like anything, just a lot of boiled veggies in a red watery soup. \n\nYou'd think after 6 dishes between 4 people we'd be full but ended up having to order another drunken noodle dish but this one with just veggies. Sadly this second round was not as good as the first one with sea bass. We also go their mango sticky rice for dessert.\n\nOverall, some of the dishes were very good but not good enough to justify the price."

Definitely make a reservation if you can! \n\nThe restaurant is located in a somewhat empty plaza but when you enter the restaurant itself, it's a bit nicer. Service was good. They refilled my water without me having to ask and came to check up on us from time to time. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nCrispy duck with Panang curry ($28) - basically fried duck in a red coconut curry sauce. This dish was a favorite of my boyfriend. The flavor was good and the crispness of the duck was a nice element with the curry. The duck itself was nothing special to me however. It was salty and without a lot of rice and curry, I wouldn't have eaten another bite. Probably would order the roasted duck with Panang curry next time, cheaper price for almost the same thing. \n\nKha Soi ($10.95)- egg noodles in a coconut curry broth. I ended up ordering the beef to pair with the noodles. The noodle portion however, made me laugh. In one chopstick grab, I could hold all the noodles. Hilarious. The broth was even saltier than the duck. \n\nGarlic prawn ($28)- fried shrimp tossed in garlic and salt. Tastes exactly like it sounds. Nothing special. They separated the shell and the meat so one prawn looks especially big. Just ok. \n\n\nOverall, if I had just ordered regular Thai dishes, it would be okay, but for the price I paid for the garlic prawns and duck, it's way to overpriced. I can get a steak for that much. It's a nice run for your money. Not complaining though, it is Vegas after all."

It was still a 20 min wait for us, but not too bad considering how popular this place is. Staff are very nice and helpful too when we ordered. Between the 5 of us, we got the crispy duck drunken noodles, garlic shrimp, jackfruit curry, spicy fried cod filets, nam kao tod, and the shrimp appetizer that is wrapped in bacon and egg roll wrappers, which I don't remember the name of. The description is so much better anyways.\n\nThe appetizers came out very quickly and were consumed all too quickly, so we had to wait a little bit before we got our entrees. But it all was so worth it. The food was fresh and so damn good. The shrimp were huge and the crispy duck were super crispy and flavorful! I was worried that the food would be too spicy for me, but everything was great! \n\nThe menu is extensive and there are so many items that I want to try still, I'll definitely be going there for several more trips so I can update with a more comprehensive review!"

This is a small restaurant located in the Commercial Center (doesn't look like much outside, I know), but so many regulars come here, so this is a busy lunch buffet. On the walls are framed pictures of the owner/cook with various people (Mayor Oscar Goodman is one of them), as well as notable articles of recognition- numerous \"best of\" and such. \n\nYou pay at the door, before getting seated. If there are already a number of diners in the restaurant, it could be a few minutes- but not more than 15 minutes. Service is pretty good. Drink orders are filled right away. The dirty plates are taken off your table pretty quickly. \n\nThe buffet is not large, but it is high-quality. The yellow curry with tender chunks of potato and chicken is my husband's favorite- he said that he could drink the sauce with a straw. There are two or three stir fried dishes with a good mix of noodles, vegetables and chicken. Also on the menu: soup, salad, fruit, chicken wings, french fries, rangoons, dessert spring rolls (banana & coconut), jello squares, shrimp chips, and rice. I might be missing a few things- this is from memory."

The cab drivers will also vouch for the popularity and demand of this place. \n\nWe had the usual Pad Thai and Papaya Salad for appetizers. The grilled shrimp, green, red, and yellow curries are all good. The squid salad is excellent. The basil and garlic eggplant dish is excellent. You can substitute green beans if you're not a fan of eggplant. If you like your food spicy and your guests do not, make sure to ask for the fish sauce and fresh Thai bird chillies. That gives it a nice kick. Just be careful, it can make a grown man cry. One if our guests tried some and had tears run down his face as he grabbed for the Chang beer. \n\nChang beer is the best pairing for Thai food - IMHO. They have a huge wine cellar and it sure looks impressive behind the glass room. However, I just can't seem to muster up the taste buds to pair this amazing Thai food with wine. \n\nI have been to this restaurant several times before.

The food came out at a decent time considering they were extremely packed on a Saturday night. \n\nThe only big problem I have with this place is that their portions are pretty small. If you plan on sharing with a big group of people, I suggest ordering two of the same dish. Their noodle & curry dishes were especially small. Also when we ordered the mango sticky rice, there wasn't that much rice, it was a horrible mango to rice ratio.\n\nMust get: according to my friends their crispy garlic prawns! This is a must, my friends were drooling over this dish for the longest time. They also said the duck curry is delicious as well. Oh and order the Thai tea as your drink. \n\nI tried their fried tofu, pad see ew and pad Thai. All these dishes taste the same everywhere else, it just cost more here and the portions are a lot smaller. \n\nMango sticky rice was bomb! Loved how the rice wasn't too sweet, it was perfect, just wish there was more rice. The fried bananas were also yummy as well if you like bananas. \n\nOverall a yummy dinner, this place is just expensive for the amount of food they give you."

We then ordered crispy salted prawns, crispy duck curry and soft shelled crab drunken noodles. The duck curry was amazing! We all loved it. The prawns were equally impressive. They fry the prawns and shells separately by the way. So crispy and delicious! There was nothing special about the drunken noodles other than the crabs.

So, we'd wake up in the morning, and call ahead to get a reservation, and find out that they didn't take reservations, and it'd be like 2 hours before we get a table. So, we never went there.\n\nEventually I made it out there, and my friend was right. Crazy good Thai food at reasonable prices, and it is in a highly sketchy part of town.\n\nFast forward a few years, and now whoever I happen to be eating with, no matter how hardy a Vegas vet they are, is always willing to consider Lotus as a food suggestion. I've tried probably a good third of their menu, and pretty much everything is great.\n\n(As for the \"no reservations\" thing...they don't take reservations FOR LUNCH. You can totally get reservations for dinner.)\n\nIf you're coming here, I'd recommend starting with the Prawns in a Blanket. Expertly unshelled shrimp wrapped in bacon, and that is then wrapped in crispy wonton skin and fried to perfection. Served with a sweet dipping sauce.\n\nThe crab fried rice is great, and pretty much every curry that you order will complement this.\n\nAll of the curries are terrific, and while everything may seem a little on the small side, the combination of the curry sauce and the rice is generally enough to keep me well satisfied. \n\nGenerally, you'll end up dropping about $20-$25 per person here, and have yourself a pretty good meal. I consider this a definite go-to, though I recommend trying to get out there on a weekday rather than a weekend. You'll find the waits much shorter, or may even get lucky enough to walk in and get seated immediately."

It looks like deep-fried rice, actually, when it comes out, but apparently yes folks, that IS sausage.    Very strong flavors of sourness (from the lime juice?), hot chilis (spiciness can be to your requested level) and lots of other complex flavors all put into a very tasty combination.   \n\nWe moved onto their spicy beef, drunken seafood noodles, spicy seafood salad, and tom kah kai soup.\n\nSpicy beef = 5 stars.   GREAT flavors, down to the lime juice - infused bed of cabbage that the beef is sitting on.\n\nDrunken seafood noodles = 4 stars.  Good, but not life-changing.  Nice combination of lots of seafood (imitation crab, squid, shrimp, and ooh even a mussel was thrown in there!)\n\nSpicy shrimp salad = 3.5 stars.  You can request the spiciness to the level of your comfort, and we asked for \"medium.\"   We found the dish to be flavorful, but a bit too salty and a bit too spicy for our tastes.  I felt overwhelmed by the dish after a couple bites and couldn't really eat much more.\n\nTom kha kai soup = 4.5 stars.  VERY well-balanced, complex, fresh flavors.\n\nNo room for dessert, though I was very tempted to get coconut ice cream just to put out the fire in my mouth and mellow out all the strong flavors I'd just ingested.\n\nDefinitely a good place to go if you like Thai food and/or strong / spicy flavors, but I don't know that it's the \"best Thai food in N.

I figured the Tom Ka Kai would be similar to the offerings in my home town given the simplicity of the ingredients, but LoS managed to even step that up....delicious.  For anyone who isn't familiar the soup consists of coconut milk, galanga, ginger, lime juice, chicken, mushrooms, fish sauce and a little black pepper.\n\nNext up was the only dish I had eaten on my one prior trip here,  the Garlic Prawns.  These were just as good as I remembered.  Salty, sweet, crunch with a strong garlic and black pepper kick.  Shrimp were impeccably fresh and clean tasting.  Don't be scared of the fact that the shrimp shells are included......they literally turn to delicious crackers.\n\nAfter eatings the prawns, which I already knew I loved, I actually expected to be let down my the following main courses, but I was pleasantly surprised.   We had our waiter, whose name I unfortunately can't remember(he was excellent), recommend us a signature dish and a noodle dish.  He recommended the Pad Se Eww for the noodles and Charbroiled Beef in a Young Peppercorn Sauce.  The former was excellent with perfectly cooked wide flat noodles, sweet/salty brown sauce and crunchy chinese broccoli.........but the Charbroiled beef was the thing of legends.  Beef cooked nicely medium with crunchy green beans and green bell pepper served with a savory brown sauce heavily flavored with the intensely vibrant and sharp taste of young peppercorns.  This makes for a unique and brilliant combination of flavors.\n\nI can't state whether this is, as reviewed, the \"best Thai restaurant in North America\", but I think I can safely assume they make a VERY strong case.\n\n**Note: Don't be scared to ask your server for recommendations.  Ordering \"tradition\" or plain jane Thai dishes here doesn't seem to be the way to go."

At first, I thought that my boyfriend had made a mistake, but no, it's really in a strip mall.  Call my snobby, but I was definitely shocked.  I was also worried about showing up at this time without a reservation.  We were running late for another event, so yes, I was a bit nervous.  As soon as we got there, though, I was able to immediately get a table and a couple of menus. \n\nI thought that it was a little overpriced, and that our server was a bit slow in refilling our water glasses, but all in all, pretty good dining experience.  \n\nWe ordered the following (and yes, we had them bring everything out at once and we didn't have any leftovers either...definitely starving):\n\nBeef Satay Sticks - so delicious and full of flavor\n\nChicken Satay Sticks - delicious too, but a bit tougher than the beef sticks (so we ate these last)\n\nThe accompanying cucumber salad was as good as expected.\n\nBeef with Pepper Garlic Sauce - the portion was a little smaller than expected, but the garlic pepper sauce was just enough to complement the tenderness of the beef.\n\nSea Bass with Ginger - again, the portion was definitely a lot smaller than anticipated, and the sauce seemed to be a bit much for the portion of fish that they gave us, but again it was still delicious, although it felt like i was eating a soup rather than a sea bass dish.\n\nI'll admit that I was pretty impressed that even though we told the guy that we were in a hurry and the place was fairly packed, we got our food within 15 minutes of ordering.  However, I guess that the guy was a bit too busy to check back on us about our drinks, since I had to flag him down twice to give me a water refill.  \n\nMy only gripes are about the sort of slow service and the portions, prices, and a bit of the food.  All in all, I'm definitely willing to return and try this place out a second time.   \n\nWhenever I get around to making a return trip, I'm not sure, though, if I'll be able to try anything other than the beef satay or beef with garlic pepper sauce.  Those two dishes are definitely a favorite of mine, at least for now."

It is located near Sarhara in a deserted shopping center near Downtown.  I don't see any other reason to drive out here other than to eat here.  Parking is simple with the huge lot and plenty of parking since this is the only place that seems lively...\n\nThere might be a wait if you come during a busy time.  We came around noon and had to wait for around 20 minutes...(even though there were open tables...)  But I think I understand why they did that.  Unfortunately, the kitchen is quick but not quick enough to meet the demand and having people wait in line might be better than having them wait for food.\n\nSo was Anthony Bourdain and all the other celebrities (pictures all around the restaurant) just joking or is this place the real deal?\n\nOrder the garlic prawns! At around $30, it is pricey for 7 pieces of prawns but it was the best dish we had.  Not overly garlic-y and cooked perfectly so to not burn the garlic.  The prawns are huge and butchered perfectly so that you can devour the entire prawn (shell and all).\n\nOrder the Nua Nam Tok (Beef Salad with crushed toasted rice).  The beef was moist and fattier than other Thai restaurants I have had this dish at.  The fat was the difference.  Even though I prefer lean meats, the fat made the beef tender and flavorful.  The sauce was salty, sour, and spicy at the same time with a mixture of greens and a slice of cabbage.\n\nSkip the Crispy Duck with Drunken Noodles or just order the drunken noodles by itself.  The crispy duck wasn't that crispy with our duck fat still not fully rendered.  The duck was not worth the premium to make this dish around $30.  Without the fat rendered out, it was similar to BBQ duck from a Chinese BBQ place...  As for the noodles, they were fried well with a layer of sauce on them.  The portion was a bit small.   Might be bigger without the crispy duck.  Finish the noodle quickly or they start to clump together.\n\nThis place is worth the visit.  I want to try the other items on the menu since they specialize in Northern Thai cuisine.  Will be coming back for the garlic prawns.  Beware of the wait for a table and then the wait for your food but if you have the time, it's a must try.  Just ask the other 3000 reviewers."

            "review": "During my most recent trip to Vegas, Yelp Elite Lam N. recommended hitting up Le Thai for some off-the-Strip good eats. Unfortunately, I could not get reservations until after 9 pm.  After looking through trusty Yelp, we found Lotus of Siam, which lives up to its four stars.\n\nVENUE\nLotus of Siam looks like a dive bar. You're greeted with neon lights in the front and a bar with concrete floors and TVs right when you walk in. But don't let this trick you because this is actually a restaurant too! And Lotus of Siam serves GREAT food. The seating arrangements are a little odd-- between the bar and the host area, there are four or five dinner tables, so you have to squeeze into your table. There's a lot more room in the back, but we didn't sit in the back room area.\n\nFOOD (4.5/5)\nInterestingly, the menu is on the little 4\"x6\" folding card that you'll find on your table. At first I thought it was their happy hour menu or advertisement, but then I realized that the entire menu was on one side of the folding card. Although the selection isn't vast, you'll find plenty of entrees to keep your tummy happy.  Lotus of Siam will have all the familiar Thai dishes-- pad thai, drunken noodles, Tom Yum Koong soup, shaking beef, papaya salads, stir fry vegetables, fried bananas for dessert, coconut and brown rice and curry. I think we ordered pretty much everything, and we were very satisfied. \n\nSERVICE (5/5)\nSO good! Most of the restaurant staff were young and they were all very gracious and helpful.  We had a large party, and they were always ready to help clear dishes, make more room (our table was small for the quantity of food we ordered), bring extra silverware and napkins, and keep our drinks refilled. They were happy to help take as many pictures as we requested, and they always kept their cool even though they were busy and dealing with a lot of food orders."

We had the chicken dumplings, pad see ew, massaman curry and the veggie fried rice. Everything we had was fresh and delicious. if you like Thai food this is a must while in Vegas.  In terms of location, it's a bit off the strip, a 7 min cab ride, and there is not much around it. The restaurant itself is very casual, and most of the clientele is Thai- that's how you know it's authentic.\n\nOverall it was a great experience. The only thing is that they only serve beer and wine, and I would have loved a cocktail, but it didn't take away from the experience at all."

            "review": "5 Stars, and here is why....\n\n1.  If the restaurant closes at 10pm, and you can still roll in at 9:55pm for a meal - Good.  The service is still excellent - Better.  The quality of the food is still exceptional - Best.  Lotus is tops on all three accounts!\n\n2.  Wine List and Pairing.  Not only does Lotus have an outstanding wine list, it has the largest selection of German Whites in any restaurant - in the world, if memory serves.  Also, any restaurant whose wait staff knows wine enough to pair with my meal makes me happy.  However, despite the large number of Sommeliers and wannabes in Las Vegas, I rarely find a member of the general wait staff who can confidently assign a wine to my meal without looking at the price or without pairing  by color.\n\n3.  Of course, the food!  I know that I've enjoyed a Larb Salad in another place better, but not an entire Thai meal.  To start, three of us ordered the Hot Pot-sized Thom Kha Kai, a wonderful coconut and lime-based soup with mushrooms and chicken, which was simply pleasing.  It was creamy, tart, sweet and savory; so perfectly balanced that it could have easily satisfied me as a main course.  Next, a Larb Salad (Chicken).  This could have been better to my taste, but was well-seasoned with mint and onions and very aromatic.  Finally, the main course - Nua Yang Panang.  I love Panang curries, and this one, with its embellishment of cognac, was one of the best I've ever had.  The sauce was so good my friends and I made balls of rice to sop up every last bit - the dishwasher got off easy with us!\n\n4.  Price.  Yes, you can spend (and maybe should spend :)) $30-40/ person at Lotus of Siam.  Yes, you can probably make decent curries at home now without the time and expense thanks to the plethora of bottled Thai sauces - think Heinz 57 of Thai...blegh!  But the total bill for all of us including my $10 glass of Piesporter, the menu listed in #3 and another's fried rice, just cleared $60 with tax.  That's right folks $15 a person!  Can you eat at any other of the World's 100 Best Restaurants at dinner for $15?  I think I hear Thomas Keller laughing...nervously...\n\nBottom line:  Well, worth the drive from anywhere for the excellent quality, selection and service.  A super way to dine at one of the World's Best!"

            "review": "The food was good but based on all the hype, I was slightly disappointed. Not to say that I didn't enjoy the meal, because I did, but I was just expecting a little more.\n\nWhat we ordered: crispy wontons, tom yum soup, pineapple fried rice with chicken, seafood drunken noodles (spicy level 5), garlic prawns and roasted duck in panang curry.\n\nAs appetizers, the crispy wontons and tom yum soup were very good. The soup however left me slightly disappointed because it wasn't HOT when it came out. It was more like, warm.... why?\n\nOut of our entrees, the roasted duck in panang curry is AN ABSOLUTE MUST. It was a favorite of the entire table. Perfect in every way possible, I wish I could eat this everyday! The garlic prawns were ordered per the server's recommendation and I'm so glad we did! It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly crispy and not drenched in oil. I even tried eating the shell and it was so good! :) \n\nI loveeeee seafood drunken noodles but these drunken noodles were just okay in my opinion. Again, it didn't come out very hot so that was disappointing. And the spicy level of 5 (which I heard would be pretty spicy) was not spicy at all. Also, I'm not a fan when restaurants (especially with such a hyped up name) uses imitation crab meat or anything for that matter, so that was slightly disappointing. The pineapple fried rice had yellow curry in it so that was interesting, but not quite my preference. It was just OK and I'd never order it there again. \n\nSo with that said, the roasted duck in panang curry (under chef's selection) was amazing so make sure you try that! And the garlic prawns as well! Make sure you call ahead to make reservations. It may be hard to get a hold of them, but persistence will pay off in the end."

I've definitely had better even in my little local in Scottsdale. Not being familiar with their Northern dishes I didn't want to be too adventurous so went with what I knew.

We ordered a bowl of hot and sour soup with chicken (very different from what I am accustomed to, but extremely delicious), duck curry (spicy and delicious), sweet and sour chicken (AWESOME, i ordered a batch to go after the dinner) and I forgot what the last entree was but it was chopped up pork that was very minty with flavorful spices.

It's in a plaza next to some Korean Club/Karaoke joint. I'm not going to lie but I definitely wanted to check out the Korean place out. Maybe some other time. \n\nWe got a bottle of White Wine, The sticky rice appetizer, Crispy Duck in Panang Curry, Garlic Prawns, and Drunken noodle with crab. \n\nHonestly the food was phenomenal. The only issue I had was that I felt that the portions were small and pretty pricey for the amount of food you get and what it is. Obviously if a restaurant like Lotus of Siam gets so much hype you can probably charge whatever you want. I would definitely come back again.

The main focal point however, was a wall full of wine. An actual wine cabinet filled with hundreds of bottles. Super dramatic and awesome! There's also a bar down the ramp inside, so you can drink something while you wait for your table. \n\nFor dinner, me and my party decided on the following:\n\nGarlic Black Pepper Chicken Wings for $8.95: Wings seasoned with garlic, black pepper and other seasonings. The garlic was prominent in this dish and made the wings soo delicious. One of my favorite things that evening!\n\nMoo Yang for $14.95. Marinated charbroiled pork served with spice sauce. This is always my go to dish. The pork chop was super tender, the sweet marinade and the sauce really seemed to enhance the dish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this if you like pork.\n\nChicken Pad Se-ew for $9.95. Stir-fried wide rice noodles with eggs and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce. This was the best Pad Se-ew I've ever had! The flat noodles were soft but not mushy, the sauce was mild and salty and really made that dish pop out!\n\nPork Drunken Noodles for $9.95. Pan fried flat rice noodle topped with, saut\u00e9ed choice of meat with fresh & dry chili, Thai basil, served on beds of greens. I loved the basil in this dish. It brought a clean flavor to the overall taste. \n\nAll dishes were served family style and was awesome! People always talk about this place as being great. You really need to try this out, for sure! I remember waiting in the front at the beginning of the night and everyone that kept coming in, made a comment like, \"this place is in a sketchy neighborhood, but trust me the food is out of this world.\" It's not until you experience it yourself that you will truly believe that statement. If you're ever in the neighborhood, don't pass it. Stop, and give it a try. You will NOT be disappointed!"

I was so full but I WANT EVERYTHING all over AGAIN!!!! O_ O & end my review w/ that.... but I have to EXPRESS what wonderful flavors I got to experience.\n\nService was on PAR they were quick & not once did u see my glass of water ever get below half way. They really had TEAMWORK on point. We had a reservation at 6pm & the place was PACKED even in the little waiting area & it did NOT slow down at all even as we were leaving....\n\nThe plaza that this resteraunt is located literally makes you re-think if you want to be dining there.... but do Not let this fool you or drive you away in any way! Definitely like finding a treasure box in the middle of the desert!\nThe interior was simple w/ not too much cluttering decor. The waiting area & entrance was quite small. There are a whole but of pictures that are framed of all the famous people that have dined here one being the GREAT Chef Joel Robouchon. They also have a glass cellar of wines galour that is one of the only thing that makes this resteraunt give it a CLASSY look hahahaha =]\n\nSPICY WINGS $8.95 - just full of flavor & the right amount of spice to blend w/ the sweetness\n\nSCALLOP DRUNKEN NOODLE $23.95 - Scallops were HUGE & again another flavor packed dish\n\nFRIED WHOLE FISH - this fish was amazing like the bones we're crispy enough to be like chips.\n\nGARLIC PRAWN $26.95 - OMG OMG I could eat a freaken whole plate to myself. The crispyness of this dish is PERFECTION!\n\nPLAR LAAD PORK $25 - I think this one was the curry sauce that went well w/ the rice that it came with.\n \nNAM KAO TOD $8.95 - a nice crispy rice appetizer dish that is refreshing w/ the perfect amount of spice & still refreshing w/ some weggies on the side.\n\nFRIED BANANA ROLL $8.50 - cute little wonton shell rolled banana w/ the perfect crunch to every bite\n\nMANGO & STICKY RICE $8.95 - O_O soon good!! They also do NOT serve this dish if the mango is not to perfection!\n\nYUM NAUH $13.95 - THAI beef salad refreshing w/ a kick\n\nTHAI TEA $2.50 - not the BEST that I've had but it was still good.\n\nBut all in all EXPECT a wait if you don't make a real!!"

            "review": "TL;DR: Above average Thai food at a significantly above average price.\n\nMost of the Yelp reviews here have painted a pretty decent picture of the pretty decent food at the restaurant, but a lot of them fail to acknowledge the decently high price you have to pay for their most famous dishes; the garlic prawns and crispy duck dishes are all nearly 30 dollars. And for the portion size of the duck, it is certainly significantly overpriced.\n\nThe food itself is almost as good as it is hyped up to be on Yelp, and it is probably better than your local Thai place unless you happen to live somewhere in Thailand. The curries and sauces are flavorful, as most Thai places generally make them, and this restaurant offers quite a vast menu with many Northern Thai options you don't often see elsewhere. A lot of people recommend the crispy rice appetizer, but to each their own, since I thought it tasted like salty and sour crispy rice that tasted probably just as good as my description. I don't drink personally, but there is a large selection of wine here, too.\n\nThe price was a bit higher than your average Thai meal, and the portions aren't especially generous. The rice is served in small bowls and is probably the weakest link at this restaurant. I'd say this restaurant falls into the common Yelped up restaurant category, serving good food at a slightly excessive price. This place is a solid four star place that is worth a couple of visits, but a far cry from a five star location that would be a regular in my book."

Our phones beeped, \"FLOOD ALERT!\"  Was this really a good day to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday? We didn't know what to expect when we pulled into this shady plaza off the strip, hoping to try the Lotus of Siam that everyone raved so much about. \n\nWe were lucky, planning ahead and reserving our tables. As a word of advice, I suggest that you always ALWAYS reserve ahead of time before coming to this place. Even with such horrible weather, there were hordes of customers waiting outside in queue. \n\nBeing seated into the restaurant, it was a bit overwhelming at first. It was crowded - so so crowded. There were pictures framed covering every inch of the walls, tables everywhere leaving little space for walking, kitchen staff and servers bustling and turning. The menu was extensive and we didn't know where to start and choose from. Our  server even forgot to give us our straws until perhaps 7 minutes into the dinner service. \n\nSo then, why the 5 stars?\n\nAs we all know, it's the food. The food is what kept us happy and going, and saved this restaurant from being anything less than 5 stars. \n\nAs there are descriptions of most of the food already in other reviews, I'll just list down what I loved, liked, and would pass. \n\nLOVED:\n\nGarlic Prawns - it's expensive. A chef special. But the shells tasted like a crunchy chip, and the shrimp was fried to perfection. \n\nSeafood Thai Fried Rice - we actually ordered 2 of this because of the fact that the fried rice was so chunky! They really packed this with big, big pieces of seafood. It was worth it. \n\nCrispy Duck w/ Panang Curry - Most people order this at at least a 5-8 in spicy level. My group ordered this in a 1. We don't handle spice well, but we still loved it! Although small, the duck was one of the best I've ever had and the curry sauce went will with my fried rice. \n\nTom Kah Kai - I've never quite had a soup like it really, or maybe perhaps it was because I don't get Thai very often. The flavors went from tangy to sweet, always leaving you with a bunch of surprises at every gulp. \n\nFried Whole Catfish - in my opinion, this was the real winner. We ordered this last minute, needing something BIG to get full (the dishes are small in size). I'm always quite skeptical of ordering catfish as they always end up tasting like mud paddies due to where they are caught. However they raise the catfish themselves, so it tasted amazing. I suggest ordering this first as it takes the longest to cook. \n\nFried Banana w/ Coconut Ice Cream & Sticky Rice - In the Philippines, we have a similar fried banana called Turon, however it fails in comparison to these. The fried banana didn't taste like it was drenched in glaze and oil. It was also fresh! The coconut ice cream tasted really good. Nothing like those that are store bough. The sticky rice was greatly balanced between too sticky and just plain soggy, a nice meet in the middle. \n\n\nLIKED:\n\nKhao Soy - For people who like spicy food, this is a winner for you! As for me, I could only take about 2-3 spoonfuls before my tongue started burning for mercy. However, within those few bites, I loved the flavors it produced, sweeter and mild. We ordered this with chicken, but it was a bit dry. \n\nTom Kah Kai - this also had a whole range of flavors to it. Minty, zesty, tangy. All I can say is that it was very complex. An array of flavors, but it was just right. The only thing was that at times, it was a bit too sour for me. \n\nPad Thai - the pad Thai was good. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nDISLIKED:\n\nNua Nam Tok - the beef was super dry unless you dip it in the sauce. The problem with this is that the beef is the main spotlight of the dish. Skip it. \n\nThai Tea - I have to admit the drink was good. However, there was just so much ice and not enough tea; can you really call this a drink?\n\nIn contrast to entering the restaurant with mixed feelings, thinking it was overhyped, we left feeling happy and content. \n\nAlso, kuddos to our waiter (he was the only one in yellow) who patiently dealt with our questions about what's good, not good, and recommended."

I encourage everyone to really LOOK at the food photos and the presentation. The food is OK. It's OK/average but not great.\n\nWhat we had:\n1. Meatless shrimp rolls (fried). OK, nothing to write home about.\n2. Wonton Soup (cup) - very nice chicken dumplings nice light flavor. Veggies in soup were disappointing.\n3. Crab Salad - crab was battered and deep fried but it was not melt in your mouth, perfectly soft yet crunchy as a good crab salad should be. The accompanying vegetables were perfect and a beautiful combination. It saved this dish.\n4. Sweet and sour chicken (for my kids) - Awful. Sauce was too sweet, pineapples looked like they were canned, white meat chicken were morsels not slices. Disaster.\n5. Red Tofu Curry - Flavor was again just OK, not amazing. We've had much better.\n6. Fried Banana, Cocunut ice cream, sticky rice - The fried banana was like an egg roll with banana inside. Very typical but good. The coconut ice cream was a disappointment. The sticky rice tasted old and consistency was not sticky. it felt like frozen sticky rice that was thawed. Completely awful.\n\nTo me this restaurant is like \"Americanized\" Thai food.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place. Plus it's pricey for what you get."

If you order right, its insanely authentic. Ordered hot at level 8: dry chicken wings, soft shell crab drunken noodles, raw shrimp with insane dips, braised short ribs in a curry. \n\nThe Headline is GERMAN WINES!\nRare is the place that has a decent German wine selection. Here in a North Vegas strip mall lies a true treasure trove. From super dry GGs all the way through TBAs.  Rieslings from all regions, vintages and prices. Page after page of a list that puts pretty much all others to shame. Perfect provenance as demonstrated by the huge glass cellar for available wines. (Undoubtedly there is an offsite too). \nMark-up on the wines is surprisingly soft considering.\n\nAnd if you don't know what wine to go with, no worries. The Somm is totally relaxed and helpful. Most people are intimidated by German labels, the only label more confusing than Burgundy, so the Somm will take the time to walk you to your bottle.\n\nSo drag yourself off the strip and enjoy a rare experience of the sublime and surreal, locals and smart visitors alike. Those who know go. Again and again."

I heard great things about the restaurant from some local foodies, and hundreds of Yelp reviews echoed the same praise.\n\nOur 30 minute wait went by quickly as we read all the articles about LOS in the lobby. We were hungry and overwhelmed by the menu, but our waiter was very helpful in making suggestions. He brought over the sommelier to help us find a wine that would go with our dishes. The Riesling was an absolute knockout and an astounding value at $38.\n\nThe waiter recommended the duck panang for my husband and drunken noodles with tofu for me. My husband was in love with his dish despite the fact that he usually is indifferent about duck. He said the crispy skin reminded him of cracklins, only better. I loved my drunken noodles too. The thick, wide rice noodles were drowning in a great brown sauce and topped with fried tofu and basil. We finished up with fried bananas and ice cream (the mango was unavailable). The server who brought it out instructed us on the best way to eat the dish, something I always appreciate.\n\nIt was a spectacular meal and lives up to the \"best Thai in the country\" reputation. We've been recommending LOS to all our friends with the gentle reminder to ignore the gay bathhouse in the same strip mall."

This was the closest place to pop up on our way back to Arizona so we decided to stop by and give it a whirl.\n\nThis place is by FAR the best Thai food that I have had in America so far. But that might not really be saying much as the rest of the places have been in Arizona. But there is no place in AZ that serve Isaan food and mm mm mmmm I have missed me some Isaan food. Seeing as how both of us have not had Isaan food since we were last in Thailand, we decided to splurge a little and ended up with a $90 bill between the two of us. I'm going to just reiterate that every single dish we ordered was the best that we've had in the states.\n\nWe started out with some Moo Dad Deaw (Issan Style Pork Jerky) This was one of my favorite dishes in Thailand and I was just beyond ecstatic when I finally found in a restaurant here. Som Tum (papaya salad) with some sticky rice to dip it in was next. It was funny to us when the waitress came by and was like \"Oh you eat just like Thai style!\" Tip. Try it. Soaking up the Som Tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious. Again I find it hard to find a place that serves a good Som Tum AND have the sticky rice available so I was extremely excited. We also ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup to start out with too and it absolutely hit the spot. \n\nThen we finally reached our main courses. We decided on getting the Khao Soi and the Northern Larb. These are both Isaan (Northern region) style food that we have found impossible to find in Arizona. I'm not going to lie, the larb absolutely kicked my ass. But it usually does everywhere I have it. The dish was amazing yet I have forgotten how hot Isaan spicy really is. The Khao Soi is a noodle curry dish that is absolutely divine. I don't think that you really find this combination too much so I was glad to finally have it again.\n\nI can't wait to come back already to get some of the other dishes that I have been searching to no avail for. People might go to Vegas for gambling but I am coming back for the Thai food. It might not save me any money but it will absolutely be worth it.\n\nThe only weird part of the experience might have been the fact that there was a empty table next to us the entire time. The place was hopping, the waiting parties at the bar were getting to be ridiculous, yet there was a table for four right next to us that was left empty. Now we had a couple theories for this. A. It might have been because we smelled. Everybody was in their Night out getups and here we were in shorts and a tshirt covered with a couple layers of dirt. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a certain odor permeating around us. B. We had spicy food. This entails me sweating like a pig. A + B probably meant nobody wanted to be within a 10 ft radius of me. I will try to clean up for next time..."

But the rest of the meal was fantastic and made up for the very disappointing dip. We had the papaya salad, crispy rice and green curry. They were all amazing with just the right amount of spice for my palate. \nWe did not have reservations and there was an hour wait, they asked for our cell phone number and called us about 50 minutes later. We were downtown and it took us about 15 minutes to get back but they held our table. Service was overall very good. Though this restaurant is in a shady strip mall I would go back to try other items on the menu."

You can't help but be surprised when you enter and are greeted by walls covered in raving reviews and crowds of people. \n\nMaybe you read about Lotus of Siam in Gourmet magazine (that's how we found it), or you saw Anthony Bourdain enjoying the Garlic Prawns on CNN, or maybe you just kept hearing how amazing it is and that you simply must dine here if you're in Vegas!\n\nNow that we've been here a few times, we have our favorites, and our favorite strategies. First, if you're going to dine in, be sure to call for reservations. We, however, love the take-out strategy and their take-out is fast! Just be sure to check your order before you leave, because they might have forgotten something, like your ... \n\nGarlic. Prawns. We almost left ours there because they didn't get included in our take-out order, and I think we would have shed tears if we had arrived back at home without them. They are crispy, flavorful, and quite unlike anything else I've tried. \n\nOur other favorites include the Kao Soi, which they make for us with just vegetables, and we enjoy most of the other items from the \"Northern\" menu, like the Tom Kha Gai. Be sure to specify how spicy you like your food -- on a scale of 1-10, a \"4\" here is pretty hot, and we like spicy. \n\nWe visit Vegas at least once a year and stop here every time. It's an adventure that's worth a little drive!"

I guess it's hard to live up to the \"BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN NORTH AMERICA\" billing. That creates some pretty unrealistic expectations. \n\nStill ... \n\nThe place has a great vibe -- kinda like eating in someone's home. I would suggest that, unlike us, try going when they are not in the middle of their lunch buffet. Even though we ordered off the menu, I think the kitchen struggled to get out of their all-you-can-eat mindset. \n\nThe BEEF JERKY ISSAN STYLE (#13A) was an adventure. Nice as a diner to try something this unfamiliar. Had really interesting flavors but before the beef was jerked the silver skin (tough and bitter) was not trimmed properly (or at all) and some of the bites were chewy in an unpleasant way. \n\nThe NAM KAO TOD (#14 Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage) was really amazing. If you like that essential Thai taste of lime, powdered-toasted rice and fish sauce, make a point of trying this dish -- it was very good. The only criticism is when they say minced, they're serious. The sour sausage (which looked suspiciously like tiny cubes of chopped up ham steak) was hard to pick out (tastewise) from the other flavors. We ordered it medium and it was plenty spicy (we had two small children with us). This is a dish that I suspect gets better when you dial up the heat -- but even at medium was outstanding. \n\nI ordered the PORK STEW NORTHERN CURRY (#K. from the NORTHERN menu) and it was good. This is a \"dry\" style curry so if you're looking for lots of gravy to sop up with your rice go another direction. Some of the chunks of pork were fatty and some were a bit parched. I am a sucker for anything braised (I like the mouth feel) but without much liquid everything seemed a little dry. Still, overall, the dish had, as other reviews have mentioned, a nice homey feel. \n\nTHAI LIME DRINK was a nice touch on a hot LAS VEGAS afternoon. \n\nHowever, the YELLOW CURRY (#129 with chicken) was really disappointing. My wife ordered it to share with the kids since it's one of their THAI favorites. In all fairness WYATT, my three-year old, ate more than his share and seemed to enjoy it -- then again he insisted on a McDONALD's happy meal on the drive over from SAN DIEGO. The chicken was grainy. The carrots were really al dente, the potatoes were nearly raw (literally not figuratively) and the yellow-curry and coconut cream base were thin and sadly bland. I think if it sat on a steam table for an hour or two the vegetables would have cooked through and the curry itself would have reduced down and concentrated the flavor. \n\nThe single best THAI restaurant in North America ??? I don't think so but still, for the most part, pretty good."

When you step in the door you are greeted by a narrow waiting area filled with newspaper write-ups over the years giving kudos to Lotus.  If you are a drinker your best bet is to wait for your table in the bar area as there will be a wait--weekends can run up to an hour or more.  The bar is beer and wine only.\n\nThere are tons of tables inside Lotus of Siam with bright hanging pendant light fixtures.  If you are looking for a dark atmosphere you won't find it here.  \n\nLotus of Siam has really great tasting Thai food plus an excellent selection of wine.  I had the drunken noodle crab.  It was good but a bit steep in cost at $19.  My friend had a beef dish that cost $18 that she felt was overpriced.  I feel like your best bet is to order from their basic Thai side of the expansive menu as those dishes are $10 or less and will be same portion size and just as tasty.\n\nTip for the restaurant:  the food is served in shallow dishes which means that it gets cold quickly.

We drove up and saw a crowd in the front. Walked into the restaurant and saw nothing, but people waiting to be seated so I thought to myself that this thai place is great. But oh boy, what a BIG BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! There was nothing great about their thai food. These people that rave about this place must have not had good thai food. Also, quite honestly the reviews are coming from non-asian people. C'mon now, the food was mediocre and the proportion was only enough for 1 person; my 2 year old niece ate the curry dish all by herself. It was edible, but nothing out of this world like everyone else is talking about.  The only highlight of the evening was the bottle of wine we ordered. For all you thai fans, the next time you're in CA, go to this hole in the wall joint called \"Thai Pepper\" in Huntington Beach.  Two 70 year old ladies are busting out authentic thai dishes."

After our first day in the blistering hot desert we had the chance to hit up this savory little thai treasure.  \n\nEating here was a sensational taste journey into an adult willy wonka wonderland of thai delicacies both salty and sweet.  I will be back someday, and next time I will make sure i go with many~many~many friends so I can sample their entire menu of heavenly food.  \n\nIf I had a choice to live in peaceful blissful heaven with great food.  Or burn in hell every day for the rest of my mortal and immortal existence but partake in daily trips to Lotus, I'd choose an eternity in hell without thinking twice!\n\nLotus of Siam is the best thai food i've had to date in the US."

The location is a kind of run down shopping center. \n\nI tried it last Saturday.  They opened at 5:30pm, we arrived around 5:50 and there was a 45 minute wait. \n\nWe ordered the beef pad thai, beef panang, yellow curry, sweet and sour pork, pad sw-ew and kra phao moo krob to share.  I had my kids with me so we each ordered one dish that we wanted to try and shared.\n\nAll the dishes were flavorful, the pad thai was hands down the best I've ever tasted.  The Kra Phao Moo Krob was probably the best dish we had.  Deep fried pork with basil, oh my!!!  Crispy yet as it sat in the sauce, the flavors of the sauce penetrated the pork and just made it absolutely delicious.  The Panang was a little spicy for me, but was also flavorful.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try other dishes on their menu."

It was said to be the best Thai restaurant on the west coast. Well after I heard that I had to see if this was true.\n\nWe called to make reservations however they don't take reservations. We took a taxi from our hotel and let me warn you that this is off the beaten path. When we arrive it was about 8PM and I honestly thought we were in the wrong spot. It's located in an old strip mall. \n\nUpon entering we found that the restaurant was packed, that's always a good sign. We sat down and proceeded to order a bottle of wine, Rudi Pichler Riesling. It went very nice with the spicy red curry. I am not a big meat person and would rather not touch the stuff. I do make exceptions and this visit was one of them. My friends and I usually opt for family style dining when we go out. It's no surprise that meat is ordered but I tend to leave them alone. \n\nWe had the Tum Yum soup (I remember this because yum= yummy) which had a little kick but was excellent. Next came the entr\u00e9es, forgive me because I don't have the names. Red curry sauce with duck, and Pad Thai. Remember what I said earlier about meat? Honestly the duck dish was prepared and presented beautifully. I had to take a nibble. The meat was tender but the outside was breaded lightly. Great texture. The red curry was perfect because it wasn't overwhelming and went very nice with the duck. Pad Thai was the best because the noodles were not mushy as some places tend to over cook, and the flavor came alive in my mouth! (I need to go back, my mouth is watering just writing this.)\n\nAfter dinner we finished with some Tozai snow maiden sake and some banana dessert. Both were an amazing finish to a perfect meal."

            "review": "Brightly lit and energetic restaurant serving fantastic, authentic and mouth watering Thai cuisine, paired with a respectable wine list.  That pretty much sums up Lotus of Siam (LOS) for me. \n\nSince moving out to Las Vegas a few years ago, I have always heard about LOS, but have never ventured out to give them a try.  And when I finally went with a group of Meetup folks, the overall experience was positive.\n\nLOS is a Thai restaurant that does truly deserves the many accolades that has been given by food critics, from the ranks of professionals to amateurs, from all around the world over the years.  The restaurant features a fairly large menu selection, some are common and easy to find on other menus, but more importantly it has entr\u00e9es and specials that are not available in most other Thai restaurants in the US.  \n\nNow, I am not saying every dish that is prepared and served from the kitchen is perfect and absolutely delicious, because it is not.  But out of the thirteen we ordered, there was only one I did not really cared for, most are good, and some are truly excellent.  Some items I thought was overpriced, while others I felt deserves the price charged.\n\nFood highlights:\nPrawn Ocha - Unique preparation of an otherwise common ingredient.  Delicious and highly recommended.  It is pricey, but definitely worth trying at least once. ($21.95)\n\n#116 Drunken Noodle Seafood - Pan fried flat rice noodle\ntopped with, sauteed assorted seafood with fresh & dry chili,\nThai basil served on bed of green. ($12.95)\n\nDesserts!  Their Fried Banana Roll is a little different from those served elsewhere, their Mango and Sticky Rice (the mango was surprisingly ripe and tasty for March, while the sticky rice was just A+), the Coconut Ice Cream was good.\n\nHits The Spot:\n#130 Green Curry with Sliced Chicken. Nothing fancy, but is still good. ($9.95) \n\n#85  Spicy Catfish with Basil Leaves - Saut\u00e9ed deep fried thin catfish slice without bone in fresh and dried chili and Thai basil leaves. ($13.95)\n\nDislikes:\n#14 Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Minced Sour Sausage) - not particularly interesting, and way too much lime for my taste.  Although others on Yelp, ChowHound, etc raves about it. So give it a try, and decide for yourself.\n\nService - Acceptable.  We had a large party of 11, and they did their best to provide decent level of service.  The kitchen was also able to space out the timing of serving the dishes, otherwise there will definitely not be any room to put everything we ordered on the two tables they put together to seat our group.\n\nRecommended group size: Small parties of 1-2, 3-4, or 7or 8 (small 2 tops, 4 tops, or 2x 4 tops). Anything larger, you will just be squeezed into tables that should seat 8 comfortably. \n\nMake reservations in advance!  Especially if you have a large group.\n\nFood: 3.5 - some hits and some misses. The noodles all seems to be good to great.\nService: 3 - probably provides better service for smaller and more manageable parties.\nAmbiance: 4.5 - It is brightly lit, which I prefer, so I can see my food and how artfully it has been presented.\nPrice: 3 - Some items seems overpriced, while others deserved the markup.  Our party average $32/person (no wine), and we were able to try a lot of food.\n\nIf I can give it a 3.5 I would, because it is better than just \"A-OK\", but not really good enough for the \"Yay! I'm a fan\"."

It was mainly the prawns. . .which is generous but I really wanted the flat rice noodles! \n\nSticky rice: strange enough, they actually placed a huge bowl of regular long grained rice on the table. Then we were also given little containers of sticky rice that was hard, too chewy, and hard to eat compared to the long grained rice.

Because most of the other shops are out of business,  there is plenty of parking. If you don't make a reservation, the wait can be pretty long. \n\nOn to the positive things about it, lol. Like it's known for, there are a ton of pictures of famous people that have been there that line walls - my family enjoyed them. Our waiter was really nice and patient, he had to come around a couple times before we had of order ready. For the amount of food we ordered, it came out very quickly. You can tell they don't take any short cut with the food here, you can taste the quality of the ingredients and the layers of flavors in each dish. My mom and aunts are very good cooks and have cooked some of the same dishes before and they're very comparable - meaning it's got the homemade taste and quality to it, because the cooks in my family go all of and don't skimp on anything just to save money. And lastly, the food was very reasonably priced. We had a large group but it didn't cost as much as I'd anticipated."

Was seated after 10 minutes in the newer dinning room with the bar.\n\nI ordered the beef combo soup since I opted out of the AYCE buffet for $10.99 The soup took half an hour to receive after ordering and was disappointing. I ordered 4 on the spice level and the taste was flat and the temperature was lukewarm. In addition, the menu stated it contained flat noodles which wasn't served and the portion was small. For the price they charge, the soup wasn't worth $8.95\n\nI would avoid Lotus of Siam for lunch in the future, it's just too busy and not worth the hassle."

First and foremost ... definitely the FABULOUS wine list (if you like Riesling, you'll LOVE this selection ... and WHAT would better calm your fiery taste buds after some chili paste???) ... the Tom Yum Kai soup is delish (but you'd better enjoy some spicy, tingling lips afterward)... and the sea bass special that was sprinkled with fresh basil, mint and chili oil. OMFG ... YUM! The NUA DAD DEAW ( Beef jerky Issan style) ap had great flavor ... but definitely traditional JERKY STYLE (dry and hard to chew). I've had better Thai-style jerky that was thicker, crispy on the outside, but very tender on the inside. The NAM KAO TOD (crispy rice) was very unique and I would highly recommend. \n\nThis place is definitely worth the trip."

Still real good though.\n\nCrispy Duck on Drunken Noodle- By far my favorite dish of the night. The duck was cooked perfectly and the added crispy on top from the fat just made it amazing. One of the best things I have eaten all year.\n\nOverall I was really impressed with Lotus of Siam. THere was an extremely high amount of hype going into the dinner and the dinner did not disappoint.

However, once seated, it took a while to get our orders placed and to get our food. This was pretty understandable, it's Easter weekend and things get busy fast - no big complaints. We ordered the garlic shrimp and the crispy duck on drunken noodles.\n\nWhile both dishes were tasty, it was a little too salty all around. The garlic shrimp felt like it had just been reheated (a few of the shrimp were a little cold and not warmed through all the way) and the drunken noodles were congealed in bunches. Overall, the food was tasty, but nothing I'd recommend going out of the way for."

Most dishes are definite winners, but word to wise, don't underestimate the spice level. Our table definitely got a swift kick to the mouth with the papaya salad. But our other starters were pretty delicious in my opinion. The deep fried shrimp is what they are known for. The shrimp is succulent and juicy, but I wasn't really a fan of the pieces that were just deep fried pieces of shrimp shell. We also tried the crispy rice. 75% of our table weren't fans, but I thought it was definitely bold on flavor. It was different and I have to admit, I actually enjoyed it and was happy to have not ordered run of the mill chicken wings.\n\nFor our entrees, we tried a variety of Thai fusion and authentic Thai. The garlic pepper scallops were very delicious. The scallops had a nice crust, but were also buttery and smooth. But my piece had a little grit to it, so I'm hoping it was pepper and not sand. The sauce was also an excellent topper for rice. Next up was the mint leaf duck which I found  equally tasty. Again, it was bold on the flavor and was not a winner at the table....but I liked it. The duck was a little gamey, but was balanced nicely by the refreshing mint and sweet peppers. Lastly, we tried the massaman curry which can be compared to a red curry with a kick to it - one that kind of reminded me of the flavor of Tom Yum soup.  \n\nThey have a great collection of wine to pair with their meal as well.\n\nAll in all an interesting experience."

Sigh. \n\nSide note: if you find yourself in a sketchy strip mall and see a tiny storefront with a sign that says Lotus of Siam and are 70% sure you're in the wrong place, you're in the right place. \n\nOnce you get inside, the restaurant is actually really big. Decor is nothing to speak of, but definitely better than the outside would lead you to believe. \n\nPrepare yourself--the menu is overwhelmingly huge. After consulting Yelp and getting advice from our server, we went with the garlic prawns, drunken noodle with mixed seafood, crispy duck curry, a small Singha and a Thai lime drink, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream for dessert. Our bill, without tip, was almost $90. \n\nI don't have a problem paying good money for good food, but it just didn't seem like the price was warranted. Our meal was fine, but not outstanding. \n\nThe garlic prawns has a great texture but seemed oily and didn't have as much flavor as I would have hoped. The prawns are pulled out of the shells, but the shells are left attached at the tail, so you have the prawn and shell separately deep fried. I would never known that you are supposed to eat the shells, but, thanks to good ol' Anthony Bourdain, my husband is more up on these sorts of things than I. The texture of the breading and the shell, and the flavor and crunch of the cabbage slaw with cilantro underneath the prawns, which was coated with garlicky goodness, were the best parts of this dish. \n\nThe drunken noodles with mixed seafood weren't bad, but weren't better than any other drunken noodles I've had. \n\nThe crispy duck curry was by far my favorite dish. Red panang curry, a generous serving of duck breast with perfectly crisped skin, and some red bell pepper. Most flavorful dish on the table, with a little bit of heat. \n\nI loved the Thai lime drink--basically limeade, tart and sweet but not too sweet, with a tiny salt. \n\nThe sticky rice was meh, which was sad because sticky rice is one of my favorite things. Would've ordered it with mango, but they didn't have any, so went with coconut milk ice cream instead. \n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong things? Maybe they were having an off night? I don't know. The same meal for a more reasonable price would've gotten four stars from me, but it was way too expensive for what it was. \n\nThe service was great. Shout out to Ettel--he was absolutely amazing! He wasn't our server, but took our drink orders and cleared our table, and was SO friendly and attentive."

I also ordered some beef rama from the Chef's selection on the last page of the menu that was very tender and delicious. YUM YUM YUMMMMM! \nHey, they also make a really nice thai tea. \n\nTo recap: don't come here when you're super hungry because you won't get fed for a while, but be prepared for awesomeness when you do."

We always get the garlic prawns that are crispy like potato chips and seasoned to garlicky perfection. Crab fried rice Paris well with those garlic prawns. Curries are also good, but beware the difference in spiciness: mild is medium, medium is hot, and hot is nuclear! Our last dish is the sweet, sour, spicy deep fried whole catfish. This is big enough for 4 to share! Definitely make reservations ahead of time to avoid the 1-2 hour wait for dinner. Once you're seated, they're quick and friendly. A one of a kind food experience that you MUST NOT MISS when you go to Vegas!"

My \"Northern Thai curry\" was actually too hot for me to eat comfortably (I had to order some plain rice to get the tofu down), although the menu really had no warning about that. My dining companion ordered his sea bass 7 out of 10 for hot. The waiter didn't ask me how hot I wanted my food, but it was clearly much spicier than the 7. I eat Thai food pretty regularly and haven't had this experience before. But that I kept eating anyway is a sign of how good it was.

Thai restaurants are pretty standard in the Bay Area, so I was really hoping for something different. \n\nReservations are a must for dinner (or anytime, probably)!! Or come right when they open at 5:30PM and get your name on the list. I came here on a Sunday night at 6PM and it was already a 30 to 45 minute wait for a table for two.\n\nDefinitely try to order items you don't normally see at other Thai restaurants. That's the key. If you go for the same old stuff that everywhere else has, then that's what you're gona get... the same 'ol boring stuff. Try something different!\n\nGet the Nam Kao Tod! It's crispy puffy rice sauteed with sour sausage. It sounds a little weird, but it's delicious! I love the crispy texture and there's tons of tangy flavor from the sausage and citrus they put in it. Watch out for the heat though! It might not seem that spicy at first, but the spice creeps up on you and lingers!\n\nThe drunken noodles with soft shell crab was SO GOOD. The sauce for the noodles is on the sweeter side. It's a nice compliment to the salty, crunchy soft shell crab. Don't forget to eat some of the deep fried basil leaves with it!\n\nBut the most amaaazing thing was their mango and sticky rice! HANDS DOWN the BEST mango and sticky rice I've ever had! The mango was perfectly ripe and so sweet. The sticky rice was unique with the hint of floral in the background. And I couldn't get enough of their coconut milk!\n\nThis is also a great place for you wine lovers! Their wine ROOM is astonishing. They have a whole binder as their wine list. They even have one FULL page dedicated to German Rieslings alone!\n\nThe menu here is huge. There's no way you can hit everything in one visit.

Dinner was a bit of a letdown considering how high our expectations were.  The common thread to the dishes we had was that they were super thai spicy even though we asked for medium.  When we were in thailand, some food was spicy but theirs was certainly way more.  Water and rice couldn't help.  I wonder if that's their trick.  To get your taste buds so numb that you can't taste anything.  Overall, it was good but not as good as Sripraphai in NYC.  Sripraphai may have less heat but is full on flavor."

My boyfriend has been asking to go here for the longest time... and in my head.. Im thinking... whats the big deal.. its just THAI food.... omg..  was I wrong!! The food is sooooo amazingly orgasmic! \n\nWhat to order:\n\nPanang curry - chicken or duck... whatever protein.. still bomb.\n\nCrispy Duck Drucken Noodles - the noodles are so good here.. you can tell it is the real deal.\n\nGARLIC CRISPY SHRIMP - if you don't order this... I have no words for you. \n\nTIP: Go during their lunch hour.. its not as busy.... if you go for dinner... be there at 5pm before doors open at 530. My boyfriend and I got there at 545pm... and had to wait for 1 hour. \n\nGood luck!!"

I definitely hit a couple of them and they were good but I am always one to seek out the spots off the beaten track. No matter where I did my research the one restaurant that kept coming up was Lotus of Siam. Some reviews have called it the best Thai restaurant in America. I've been to Thailand and I love Thai food so needless to say I was excited. When I called to make reservations I was told that they could only be made one day in advance. So we ended up going somewhere else but made a reservation for the following day. When we got there I was already excited. It's in a run of the mill strip mall and there was already a line out the door. We got there 20 minutes early and still had to wait 25 minutes after our original reservation time. However, this did not bother us because we were told to go to the bar and have a drink. When we finally got seated I was a little overwhelmed with all of the options. That being said as long as you make clear to your server what you like and don't like they will make sure to find something for you.  There were a couple of dishes that I tried that you would be insane not to. My top three favorites were the green papaya salad, the spicy drunken noodles with sea bass and crispy duck with pa nang curry. Every dish was perfectly balanced, very fresh ingredients, spice level was right on and the flavor was undeniably delicious.  I have not eaten at Pok Pok or some of the other famous Thai restaurants around the country but this is officially my favorite. If you're stopping in Vegas I feel like this is truly a must.\n\nwww.612food.com"

We tried one of them which is pretty much same or better by $5- $10 a dish. \nStill not sure what I missed. PS. notice that sugar  and star rating goes in the same direction for most Thai food in America. It does not work that way in the real Thailand."

The staff will help you (they'll probably tell you not to order jackfruit) and they will ask you how hot you like it, on a scale of 1-10. I eat fresh jalapenos so I usually go to 7-8 and that's plenty hot. \nTry the northern Thai dishes, especially the curries. The wine list is surprisingly good.

From all the reviews, I guess I had really huge expectations from this place especially since I am a big Thai food lover.\n\nOne thing I really like about this place is that the menu has Northern style cuisine. I actually have never tried Northern style Thai so it was a really cool change of pace. \n\nA big tip is that this place gets packed during busy hours. I came once for lunch and there was about 1-130 hr wait so I had to eat somewhere else. There was no way I was going to wait an hour for lunch. The second time I came, I came after dinner time around 900 and we still had to wait about 15 mins to be seated. The third time, I made reservations around 530 and had no problems getting a table.\n\nThe service is good. When it's not too busy the waiters will be on point. But when it starts getting busier, you realize that you don't exactly have a certain waiter assigned to you and it's pretty much a free for all. The more packed it is, the less good service you'll receive. When I came around 530 when it was empty, the waiters were really fast on our demands. But by the time it was hitting 700, it was hard to track down our waiter bc he was off running somewhere else.\n\nWe ordered an array of food. Drunken noodles with sea bass and soft shell crab, garlic prawns, panang curry with crispy duck, mussels and beef satay. All were okay. Nothing spectacular of sort. The drunken noodles were really OILY!! I have no idea why people keep raving about it but it's so doused with sauce and the noodles get soggy. The noodles break apart easily that whenever you pick it up with chopsticks you can't get a good bite. The garlic prawns were okay. I really like the crispness but I expected more garlic. Did not have a hint of garlic to it. My favorite was the panang curry with crispy duck. The duck was super crispy even when soaked in curry and the panang curry is sooo good!! The only downside to this dish is that they give you TOO LITTLE CURRY compared to the amount of duck!!!\n\nOverall, this place is good. I don't think it's spectacular as some people rave it to be. Its not really authentic too bc I've had some authentic Thai and it tastes better. Other than that it's a good spot to know if you're craving Thai."

I had a bit of a hard time looking for it but after a few rounds in the shopping center I've seen the green light!! I came around dinner time 8ish to be exact. There was a wait and a bunch of people already waiting in the waiting, I was not surprised. I waited less than the 30min they said it would take to be seated. I was very amused at how fast I was able to be seated. The inside of the restaurant is nice and big. I didn't realize it could seat a lot of people AND I MEAN A LOT!! It was packed for a Monday night. \n\nAs soon as we got seated I quickly glanced over the menu and ordered right away. I was very hungry. I ordered the papaya salad, charbroiled pork, red curry, and Tom yum. Let's start with the papaya salad. My server asked what spice level I would like my Papaya salad to have ranging from a 1-10, I said a 3. When I took my first bite of the salad I was expecting a mild taste, but no it felt like a burning 10!!! The spice was too overpowering and I could hardly taste the real flavor of the salad. I had a Thai iced tea on the side & I literally gulped more than half just so my mouth could cool down. I was very upset :( I love papaya salad and just having this to be too spicy really just killed my appetite. I ordered the red curry with beef. I was scared that it was going to be really spicy like the papaya salad but it wasn't at all! It had a small hint of spicy. It was so creamy and delicious. Just thinking about it is making my mouth salivate. The charbroiled pork was amazing as well! But I could compare it to other charbroiled pork I've had at other Thai/Vietnamese restaurants. The only thing that stood out about it was the dipping sauce. I'm not quite sure what type of sauce it was but it had green onions and was a cross between salty, sour, and sweet. The Tom yum was ok. Like other yelpers have mention it's nothing that's great. \n\nThe customer service was spectacular. We always had our waters and rice refilled & asked how we were doing. \n\nWill definitely come back here again & try the northern menu like others have suggested."

The location is in a strange strip mall away from the strip and the atmosphere is dated but when the food is this good, WHO CARES?!?!?! \n\nI was there on a Thursday evening around 7pm and it was relatively busy. We did not have a reservation and had a short wait. As you are waiting you have plenty of time to read the articles on the walls expressing how good this restaurant is.  I have to agree with all the articles! The BEST Thai food in North America. \n\nWe started off with the Thai Beef Jerky and Tom Yum Soup and they were both very flavorful and great. I've been told I have to try the stuffed chicken wings, but have yet had the chance to try them.  As for our main courses we asked for a recommendation from the wait staff. We ordered the Sea Bass cooked in the Drunken Noodle style. This was by far the best Thai dish I have ever eaten! I recommend that you order this! \n\nThey have a great wine selection, from glasses to bottles. I had a glass of Riesling to off set the spice and it couldn't have been better! \n\nFor dessert we ordered the mango and sticky rice. The rice was fantastically aromatic and paired great with the mango. \n\nI give this place 2 thumbs up and recommend it to everyone!"

We arrived about 30 minutes after the start of dinner service on a weekend with no reservation, and although there was already a line of people waiting for tables, we didn't have to wait long (Maybe 5-10 minutes).\n\nThe menu is quite extensive, and spans various regions of Thailand. The alcohol list is also equally as extensive, for those that choose to have some with their meal. After reading the great reviews about the drunken noodles, I decided on the seafood drunken noodles ($13). I had other people in my party get chicken pad Thai and chicken panang. \n\nThe drunken noodles came in a flavorful brown sauce, cooked well. I wasn't too impressed with the seafood mixture though. It looked like it came out of one of those cheaper seafood mixes you get in the freezer section at the Asian grocery store. It had pre-cut slices of calamari, scallops, mussels, and imitation crab. The seafood itself tasted just OK. The calamari did taste a little tough though. \n\nI asked for the dish \"medium\" spice level, and I thought it was spot-on. It was spicy enough to give you some kick to your meal, but mild enough that you won't be drowning yourself in gallons of water to cool off from the heat. The person that had the chicken pad Thai was very satisfied with her meal, and the person that had the chicken panang thought it was good, albeit also a little pricy for what he got.\n\nService was excellent despite it being very busy. Plates were taken as needed and drinks were refilled fairly promptly.\n\nI'd definitely like to come here again to try something different. I'd also like to try their lunch buffet sometime!"

But I was in Vegas on business and by myself and wanted to stay off the Strip.  The YELP raves convinced me to give Lotus a try.\n\nBottom line -- its amazing.  Go.  Even if you hate Thai food, go.  The flavors are remarkable.   I had a soup, an appetizer, and a main dish and they were all spectacular.  And if you're into wine, the list looked amazing.\n\nAnd BTW, their web site recommends reserving a day in advance, which I thought was a joke for an ethnic restaurant in a strip mall, but the place was thronged on Wednesday night.  I was lucky to be seated in 20 minutes.  You might want to call ahead."

We started with the papaya salad and the only thing to say is it was just an average salad.  The papaya could have been cut thinner to be more delicate.  Then the garlic prawns were pretty greasy and tasteless as well as the crispy duck with chili mint sauce, and not at all crispy.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and don't be tempted to eat here. If this restaurant was in NY or LA, it would not last 3 months.   In addition, the location is further insulting because the food was so disappointing."

We ordered the Garlic Prawns and a Beef Panang.\n\nGarlic Prawns: This dish was very expensive and though tasty it was not worth it by any means, essentially it's just prawns unshelled seasoned with some salt and garlic and deep fried.\n\nBeef Panang: I thought the panang curry was alright, but the beef was extremely tough and difficult to chew.\n\n-= Atmosphere: 3.0/5.0 =-\n\nNot that special, it's a pretty simple restaurant within a strip mall. Lotus of Siam does seem to have a very extensive wine and alcohol collection though if you like alcohol with your thai food.\n\n-= Service: 4.5/5.0 =-\n\nService was very good, I never needed to ask to refill my water and the server was very nice about me asking him questions about the food.\n\n-= Price: 4.0/5.0 =-\n\nThe overall price of the food was decent but some dishes such as the Garlic Prawns we ordered was overpriced.\n\n-= Overall: 3.5/5.0 =-\n\nOverall, nothing really that special, definitely not deserving of four stars and 2000+ reviews on yelp. \n\nIf you are ever in Los Angeles, CA, go to Pasadena and try President Thai, they have very similar food to Lotus of Siam, but the food is way better and cheaper too.\n\nHeck I can probably name Thai 5 restaurants in Los Angeles that is better than this."

But.. the food was to die for. The crispy duck with penang sauce was really good: the outer crispiness with the tenderness of the duck.\n\nI got a curry dish,  and it was perfectly seasoned. I used it as dipping sauce as well as for other items besides rice. \n\nThe sea bass over drunken noodles was also very tasty. \n\nI wish they had this in los angeles, going to vegas for Thai food is too much of a commute!"

Between the two of us, we had \n\n1) Koong Sarong (deep fried prawns wrapped in bacon and rice paper)\n\n2) Nam Kao Tod (Minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice)\n\n3) Yellow Curry Chicken\n\n4)  Pad Sw-Ew Chicken (Stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce).\n\nOf the 4 dishes, my favorites were probably the yellow curry and the prawns.  As for the other two dishes, I kinda had high expectations for them because they're one of my favorite Thai dishes.  Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met.  The food here is good, just not good enough to be considered 'the best' based on what i've ordered.  Pad sw-ew is like a thai staple for me, just like pad thai for some other people, and it didn't surpass my standards  for this dish.  I'd have to say that King of Thai in San Francisco is still my favorite."

It was so dark that I thought they were closed (none of the strip mall's neon lights were on), but then I saw an open sign.\n\nInside it is nicer.  Huge wine selection.  On the menu there is an entree specialty section priced in the +$20 range, but the standard menu has lots of options under $10.  My 3 friends and I got 4 entrees and two beers for under $50.\n\nI may get crap for it, but I always order pad thai as a backup when at a new thai restaurant because it's usually edible, even if the other stuff you order is not.  Everything we ordered (cashew nut chicken, lemon pepper pork, yellow curry, pad thai) was great, but I was surprised that the pad thai was phenomenal. \n\nThe guys in the group were scraping every last peppercorn off the dish.

For a restaurant to be considered the \"best\" for its cuisine, class, etc.--everything you order should be exceptional or at least above average.\n\nThat being said, the drunken seafood noodle was definitely a hit. Absolutely delicious. I love spicy food so I got it at an 8 on their 1 - 10 spicy scale and it was perfect for me! Although an 8 would probably be way too spicy for most...if you eat spicy food reguarly, a 5 or 6 would probably be good enough. If you eat American-ized \"spicy,\" go for 2 - 3.\n\nWe also ordered the Pad Thai, Tom Yum Noodle Soup, and Red Curry to share. Pad Thai was way below average, one of the worst / least flavorful renditions of this dish I've ever had. Tom Yum Noodle soup was well below average as well and again, one of the worst I've had of this dish. Red Curry was okay, nothing to rave or write home about but not horrible--not really my style so I rarely order this dish and can't really compare it to others I've tried.\n\nI guess I'm spoiled by the countless amazingly delish, authentic, AND affordable Thai restaurants that line the streets of Manhattan and Queens in my hometown of NYC but I just don't understand all the hype about this place. I would say its worth stopping by just to say you did. Also, it may be worth coming back just for the drunken seafood noodle dish. \n\nEverything, other than the drunken noodle dish, is just okay at best if you're a seasoned Thai food connoisseur or even just a seasoned foodie. To me, it seems like one of those places that perhaps once was great but let the hype get to their heads. Now, all the raving reviews are from tourists who just like to hype it up for the fact that they can say they dined where all the celebrities (whose photographs line the wall) had dined.\n\nThe Short Version:\n5 stars for Drunken Seafood Noodle\n1 star for pad thai and tom yum noodle\n3 stars for red curry\n3 stars for the long wait for a table despite there being so many empty tables open (try to call ahead and make a reservation if possible)"

We had the garlic prawns, jackfruit salad, and crispy duck curry with noodles. \n\nWe couldn't decide between curry, crispy duck, or drunken noodles, so we took a shot in the dark with that last order (crispy duck curry with noodles)- what could go wrong? Crispy duck is delicious. Noodles were okay. I didn't love the curry, because it didn't have many spices. It tasted mostly like coconut to me. I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, so I asked my cousin (a Vegas local) and she confirmed that is just how they make their curry. It's not my favorite, but did not detract from the crispy duck. If I were to do it again, I would get crispy duck on just about anything else.  \n\nThe jackfruit salad was sour, salty, spicy- full of flavor. The jackfruit was cooked and shredded, so it had a meaty texture.  (Not a raw salad, like papaya salad.) The seasoning was similar to the seasoning on any larb dish. I ate my salad on rice, and it was delicious.\n\nGarlic prawns were pretty good too. The batter was crispy and the garlic topping was delicious. Worth the one hour wait in the sketchy parking lot."

I like how the noodles are fairly soft, but nothing special. \n\n3) Drunken seafood noodles.\nThis one was terrible. Normally I love wide, pan-fried rice noodle dishes, but this one came as a giant messy wet mush of dough as the noodles got soggy and fused together.

It is a dish I am not experienced with, so maybe it just wasn't for me, but it was nothing special.  My wife had the pad thai with chicken which was okay but not great.  With all the rave reviews I was really hoping to be blown away.  The staff here was also suspect.  They seated us at the bar while we waited for a table but then didn't come to offer us any beverages.  I understand that it was near the end of the shift, but close the restaurant when it is closed, not when it is almost closed.  The bartender ignored us and just went about cleaning up his area.  Lame.  I would be willing to come back here and give this place another try, but I truly was let down this go around."

Over a number of visits, I've had the chance to sample a broad swath of their menu, and the food lives up to the mountains of accolades.  The flavors are authentic Thai - you can taste and smell the fish sauce and the kaffir lime leaf and the birds eye chilis.  Lunch after lunch, dinner after dinner, it's always consistently excellent.\n\nA tip for the culinarily curious - order the funky sounding stuff, and/or anything off the northern Thai specials page.  That's where the money is at LOS (if you're looking for your #2 Special sweet, peanutty, saucy pad thai with Thai iced tea, you may be not be as impressed - LOS is not exactly that kind of Thai restaurant)."

They have huge selection of wines so, all you wine lovers definitely check it out. It is inside a glass case where you can see each wine. I ordered pineapple fried rice and Thai tea. The tea was amazing. It's definitely better than Archi's. The fried rice was quite dry. I don't think I'll order it again. The good news is that the shrimp in my fried rice didn't smell fishy. Overall, the service was great and I would go back even as a local. I doubt that I'll go during the weekends because of the long wait. I wish they took reservations or at least call aheads."

You know, the stuff that celebrity chefs do when they go to Las Vegas, which is an underrated food city. Imagine my surprise when we're driving to the restaurant and it's off the Strip. Not only that, but the restaurant is in this little strip mall. No bells and whistles or anything from the outside.\n\nBut when we get inside (and a reservation really helps because otherwise, you're waiting hours on end for a table), it was such a different story. Ten guys and we order a bunch of food. Now, I'm not a fan of Thai food but I think I'm getting more adventurous with trying food. I heard just endless raves about this place and I had hoped it was warranted. After that meal? It was warranted. I tried pretty much everything we ordered. Not one dish was a weak link. I loved, loved, LOVED both the beef tamarind and the butterfly shrimp. The beef was cooked really to perfection. No blood, grilled right without a slightly burnt taste. The shrimp was crispy and so tasty. Great food, very little noise so you could talk to people at the table, servers who let you eat in peace.\n\nGreat place. Every Thai place I go to anywhere from now on will just be second rate in comparison. That's the sign of a worthy restaurant."

For some reason we were never able to go but this time around we definitely made it a priority -- from now on, I will be coming here EVERY trip.\n\nThis was hands-down the BEST thai I have eaten, anywhere. I am a huge fan of Thai food and while it is always really delicious, I have never eaten Thai at a restaurant where I was blown away by the flavor, ingredients and innovation in traditional dishes. I researched what I should order (there are magazine articles dedicated to what you should order when you visit!) and so our table of six ordered:  Som Thum, Crispy Rice with Sausage, Golden Tofu, Tom Kha Kai, Yellow Curry Beef, Garlic Prawn, Chicken Rama, Crispy Duck Panang Curry, and one of each of the desserts. We also doubled up (and tripled) on some of the dishes. Holy crap - everything I ate exploded in my mouth with flavor. The Crispy Rice, Golden Tofu, and Crispy Duck Panang Curry really stood out in my opinion. This falls into the top three best meals I have ever eaten in my life. No wonder this is a foodie destination.\n\nBeware:  we ordered level 7 spice on the Tom Kha Kai (Bangkok Style Soup) and Som Thum (Green Papaya Salad) and were practically blowing out fire. :-) Still really delicious though, but know your level of spice!"

And Thai food should be great.  Well, last night I was transported back to the streetside restaurants of Bangkok, and ate the best Thai meal I have enjoyed since I left that jewel of a country.  Here are a few highlights: som tam - as bombing as it should be, but if you don't like spice stay away from that one!  Snow crab with ginger, apples, lime and more.  Wow!  An entire deep fried catfish that was the most perfectly fried fish you can imagine, and came served with some incredible sweet and spicy sauce; crispy duck in green curry that was the best prepared duck I have ever had (think a skin that defines crispy, succulent meat, and not a drip of fat to be found), in a super flavorful curry with bamboo shoots; Chinese broccoli with deep fried pork lardons - call the doctor!  And many other great dishes we could share with our large party.  Some of the stuff just came out from the kitchen when they realized we were not there for Pad Thai and spring rolls.  In every way, the service was exceptional, and when the bill came I could not have been more happy.  After two days of overpriced Strip restaurants that offer more flash than flavor, this was just what the doctor ordered - authentic, huge flavors and great value.  There is a good reason why so many people rave about this place.  It rocks!  Kap khun kap Lotus of Siam!"

Gold has said this is the best thai place in north america! I was sold. \n\nI did a lot of research on what to eat and the people I went with don't eat fish but here is my take on our picks:\n\ndrunken noodles with minced chicken - the version on the menu is with seafood so you have to request it but I'm so glad I got it with the chicken instead! it complemented the noodles perfectly. the flavoring and everything was spot on and was probably my favorite dish of the night\n\nspicy pork stew - this was probably the spiciest dish we had. we tried to keep the spice level at a low since one of our friends isn't a spice eater but it still definitely had a kick. out of all of the reviews I constantly saw this dish on the must try list. surprisingly, this was my least favorite dish. since the name has stew in it I figured there would be more of the curry sauce but it was mostly pieces of pork covered in a curry sauce. it was still good...but not a must try for me.\n\ncrispy duck with chili and basil - this is a must eat if you love duck. soooo good!!! it's mostly duck skin and very crispy.\n\ncashew chicken - this was good but nothing special. I read that if you eat here and you want to be blown away you should stick to their specialties: northern thai food. so stay away from anything typical like pad thai or in this case cashew chicken. BUT it was still a delicious item and I had no complaints about it.\n\ncoconut ice cream with fried bananas and sticky rice - I had read that their sticky rice with mangoes is one of the top desserts in the US. Unfortunately, mangoes are not in season in the winter. I was sooo sad. But the waiter recommended this dish which blew us all away. the coconut ice cream was super refreshing and not too coconutty and the sticky rice was PERFECT. I'm drooling just thinking about it....\n\nThai Lime Drink - If you like limes you'll love this drink. It tastes like the vietnamese lime drink to me so it wasn't anything special cuz I drink it everytime I have pho but I love limeade so if you've never had it, definitely order this!\n\noverall, we all had a great meal here and I will definitely be coming back to try some other dishes next time I'm in vegas. Is it the best hai food I've ever had? It might be! I will need to try some more dishes to be sure. The bad part is this place is closed for lunch on the weekends so plan accordingly.

It was located in a strip mall which looked pretty deserted. We had also looked up Komol, which is right across from Lotus of Siam, but were intrigued by the reviews of this place. The place is not impressive looking from the outside, but when you step inside...totally different! We happened to come by when Las Vegas Magazine was there doing a review, which was pretty cool to see. I ordered the vegetarian Tom Yum (spicy vegetable soup) which was good! It's rare to find this in a cup size, so I was eager to try it. My friend and I both ordered the Vegetarian Drunken Noodle, which isn't on the menu, but asked that it be made as I am a vegetarian. I mentioned to the waiter that we had read awesome reviews from yelp and that we were from California. A few minutes later, an appetizer comes to our table...compliments of the manager. It was the veggie version of their \"Nam Kao Tod\" and it had tofu in it instead. The flavor was amazing, the lime juice brought out the flavors in the dish so well! Then, the manager brought over 2 glasses of wine to taste with the appetizer and he paired them nicely! When the main dish arrived (Veggie Drunken Noodle), I was practically full already. The dish had amazing color to it (please see my pic's of this dish in the photos above) with lots of tofu, FRESH veggies, and noodles. It was the BEST drunken noodle dish I've ever tasted. The service at this place was OUTSTANDING and we also noticed that the people dining behind us received the same service as well. We opted for the Sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert. OMG!!! My mouth is watering thinking about this delicious dessert. The coconut was so soft and young, and the rice was the perfect addition to compliment this. Again, 2 more glasses of wine appear and this time, it's my absolute favorite dessert wine, Muscato d'Asti. When the bill came, NO charge for the appetizer or the wine! The manager came over to our table and was incredibly gracious and a true gentleman. When we walked outside, he ran after us to make sure we weren't going to be hailing a cab, as the location is pretty remote and no cab's were in sight. We had a rental car, so we were set. Talk about going that extra mile! When we asked him how his competition was across the way (Komol is another Thai restaurant in the same lot), not one bad thing came out of his mouth and he said \"No, we don't compete with other restaurants, we like that we're a small place.\" How cool was that? My friend and I vowed that every time we go to Vegas, we will definitely come back to this gem of a place. For anyone who loves Thai, ya gotta check it out when you're in Vegas. Thanks for a great lunch Lotus of Siam!!!!!\n\nP.S...The pictures on the wall have many celebrities as well as chef's from the major restaurants located on the strip....that speaks volumes."

Would go again in a heartbeat. \n\nThey have a fantastic wine selection and unlike many Thai restaurants your wine comes in real crystal and not thick glass goblets.\n\nSo why only 4 stores?  The ambiance is assaulting.  Bright lights, acoustical ceiling tiles, disgusting carpet, cafeteria style dining rooms (the place is quite large), tackily-hung photos on the wall.  In a word:  Ick.  I noticed a dimmer switch near the wine room and almost adjusted the lighting down.  Just to give my eyes a break.\n\nThe service was not-so-bueno.  It took a very, very long time.  But all was forgiven when the first dish arrived."

            "review": "I'm kinda teetering on what to rate this restaurant.  I've read a lot that this is the 'best Thai resto in the USA' and I'm really not sure.  I can't say I know everything about Thai food, but it's one of my favourite cuisines and I've been to Thailand in the last few months to know really good Thai food. \n\nWe went with a group of five so we were able to order a bunch of dishes and share family style.  We started off with a hot pot of tom kah kai soup ($15) which was nice.  It was lemongrass-y with mushrooms and chicken in it.  Nice start to lunch.  Aside from the soup we ordered pad thai ($11), papaya salad ($9), crispy duck penang ($23), and garlic prawns ($24), and thai iced tea for me ($2.50).\n\nThe superstar of the afternoon was definitely the crispy duck penang!  I will order it again and again every time in the future.  The portion was not huge for a $23 dish but definitely worth it in flavours.  I could eat the sauce it comes with, with anything.  Second superstar were the garlic prawns.  A big platter of butterfly'd prawns that were extra crispy with lots of super goodness to it!!\n\nI know pad thai is pad thai - everyone orders it at a Thai resto and probably shouldn't be ordered in an 'authentic' place like this.  We should have listened.  I didn't like the pad thai and thought it was too tomato-y for me.  The papaya salad was nothing special either - was pretty basic.  It was also made a little too spicy for our mild request.  The thai iced tea was spot on though!!  Tasted just like the ones I ordered off the streets in Bangkok!\n\nI would give this place 3/5 because I literally just had some amazing food in Thailand a couple months ago so my standard is pretty high, and half of the stuff I wouldn't order again.  But service was pretty good, there was no line-up when we went for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and I really loooove a good thai iced tea.  I'll be back."

Another off the strip place that had me question if our cab driver was abducting us... The restaurant itself is very unassuming from the outside in a strip mall however all that pleasantly changes once you enter.\n\nThe decor is a marriage between the classic Italian restaurants in Chicago that adorn their wall with all the celebrities who have been there and a Classic Thai restaurant you would expect to find. A massive wine cellar in the dinning area adds a unique dimension. \n\nThe service here is impeccable. Our server Somchai was extremely gracious, relaxed and accommodating body language. We accidentally ordered the wrong appetizer which he gladly took back and got us the Nam Prik Ong, ground pork with a red tomato sauce curry served with vegetables and pork rinds to dip, very unique. For entrees we went with the drunk noodles with Seabass and the crispy mint duck. When I say they're both made to perfection, I mean it is perfection. We chose spice level of 5 out of 10 which worked out nicely to blend with the flavor without being too overpowering.\n\nThis is a must for folks traveling to Vegas."

For Thai food in general, it's okay.\n\nDespite being off the strip and in a secluded plaza, Lotus of Siam is hyped up by almost any Vegas native/frequenter who recommends Thai food to you. The head chef is a chef who formerly worked at the Wynn, so it's easy to see why people are excited about it. The place is usually packed with people, so reservations might be recommended (although we just walked in and had no problem getting seated).\n\nThe food itself isn't bad. It's chock full of flavor, but I can't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had considering each dish is in the double digits. (Not unusual for Vegas.) We ordered the Pad Thai and sea bass with drunken noodles with two Thai iced teas; everything was decent, but not worth the money, in my opinion.\n\nLotus of Siam is worth checking out if you're craving some Thai food while in Vegas, but keep your expectations lower if you come from an area that is familiar with Thai food."

The wontons and egg rolls were deliciously crisp and fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was to die for.\n\nThen we moved on to dinner. The Beef Pad Thai was superb and the spicy fried rice with chicken was excellent. The presentation of everything was elegant and the taste was fantastic. The service was outstanding and efficient. They tend to get very busy here - there was a line running out the door the entire time we were here. We got here at 5:30p opening and there was already a line.

We asked them to remake the food and all they did was microwave it and bring it back to us. The Penang curry had about half as much chicken as any standard Thai restaurant and the chicken was very tough. The rice that came with the curry was smaller than a single ice cream scoop, so not enough for even one person. The crispy duck with drunken noodles was not crispy, but actually squishy. The Pad Thai was flavored well, but had almost no chicken in it. I think we were able to count three or four tiny pieces of chicken. Overall, I was not impressed. The duck was nearly $30 and there wasn't even enough food for one person. We left hungry and decided not to risk ordering a dessert. I know this place has high reviews, but all I can think is that people who review it highly haven't had much Thai food. Most Thai restaurants provide better food for better prices than this restaurant."

The garlic wings looked like something left too long under the heat lamps, and then I had the Chili Mint Chicken with excessive squash or whatever the heck it was. I never thought a Thai place could massacre a dish such as Chili Mint Chicken but LOS has found a way to do it. To call this a \"buffet\" is doing the word a great disservice. I'm not expecting a spread the size of the Bacchanal buffet, but this...this is freakin ridiculous with what they're trying to pass off as a lunch buffet. \n\nSeriously for the price and especially on quality and taste Komol across the parking lot kicks LOS's derriere. If you think this is the best Thai food found in Vegas, you seriously need to pull out your Yelp app on your phone and do a little exploring. Coming here for a good lunch is the equivalent of a sucker's bet....pay out the nose, and get less in return. \n\nI can't give them anything more than 1 Star.

The restaurant itself is very nice, clean and spacious.  The busser brought our drinks very quickly. \n\nWe decided to try the Nua Nam Tok (BBQ beef dish) and the garlic pepper prawns (both under the BBQ in the menu). The food came out pretty quickly. The food was pretty amazing. The beef dish had tons of spices (cilantro, mint, green onion, red onion - just to name a few) that worked well together. It was so good! Be careful how spicy you get it. We got it medium and our mouth was on fire at the end of the meal. The BBQ prawns were my favorite. The shrimp, which came with an amazing garlic pepper sauce, was so good and tender. Its definitely a must try. It's a little on the pricey side at $25 for 8 prawns, but I would definitely get it again. \n\nOverall, I am so glad that I decided to give this place a try. One minor complaint that I have is that we only saw our waiter twice, once to take out order and once to take our check. We ended up flagging down another waiter when we wanted to order additional rice. But, it was not too big of a deal as the other waiters was willing to help us.

            "review": "Came here thinking there is a 25% chance that I'd be disappointed because of all the hype and being from Oakland where there is so much bomb ass cheap Thai food.  Nope, 99% satisfied.  The 1% is portions are on the smaller side, especially given how expensive each dish was. \n\nOn to food:\nCrispy duck panang- no joke, this is absolutely ridiculously delicious! It isn't spicy and is a type of red curry.  Drizzle on rice and take a bite of the duck=heaven.\n\nCrispy rice (nam kao tod)- so so so so so good.  Order your own, so good you don't want to share.  Perfect amount of spice and leaves a good citrus tang at the end of each bite\n\nDrunken noodle with beef- I originally wanted the one with soft shell crab but they didn't have any on the night I went :(  The beef is pretty standard and so were the noodles.  Not that it was bad but since everything else was amazing, this is pretty standard\n\nTiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton wrappers- pretty average.  I mean it's good cuz its a tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton but nothing unique.  I'd suggest saving space for the other better things.\n\nThai tea-  hard to mess this one up overall but pretty damn good.  The tea they used is brewed pretty strong and I can tell cuz it leaves the bitter tea after taste but that's how I like it\n\nTip: Make a reservation! Guaranteed during prime dinner time you'll wait 45-60min.  I called for reso a month ago and the convo went like this, \"I'd like to make reservations. We are all booked tonight! It's actually for next month. Ok, your name and number.  And don't be more than 5 min late or we give away your table!\"   This should show you that they are so popular that they DO NOT NEED YOU. \nAlong with that, when I arrived, this is what happened, I walked in and said hi, immediate response was, it is an hour wait! ok but I have reservations....oh ok, wait here.  Then I was seated in 5 min.  \n\nLesson of the story, make a reso!  The line may be busy, keep trying and trying again, it's worth it!"

Their specialty beef (forgot its name...grilled beef thinly sliced with tamarind and coconut sauce) used to be my favorite, but this time is just mediocre\n\nReally sad this happened.  I usually look forward to going here every time we go to Vegas, but not sure if we would like to come here again.\n\nThere are so many other places which are worth visiting.  Maybe i'll be back in a couple of years....so long"

All dishes were presentable but taste wise was completely different from what I thought.\n\nWe ordered the typical dishes that almost everyone would order when you go to a Thai place.\n\nPineapple Fried Rice: it was literally 1 bowl of rice. The rice was not bad but lack of pineapple and meat.\n\nBeef Salad: I did not like how saucy they made this dish. It gives the salad a weird taste to it. And the beef proportion is more than salad, which others might like but not me!  \n\nPad Thai: The only dish that I have no complaint with. It was your typical pad thai where you can order anywhere. \n\nPad Sew Ew: This is a simple dish. Noodles, meat and some sauce.

We also had the drunken noodles (like pad see ew) topped with your choice of duck, soft shell crab or sea bass (which was how we had it). Also good.  The crispy duck over noodles in a coconut curry was also a hit.  The least popular dish was the short ribs in the same, exact curry sauce as the duck...we could've skipped that one entirely. We enjoyed the meal a lot but I had to knock it down by 1 star because every dish we ordered was close to $30 which is way more than the average price of a similar dish in other restaurants within the same class/range.

When we saw what was brought out to other tables, the food looked so good that we had to change what we were going to order to what we saw! We were definitely getting more excited as the time drew nearer...\nI know that at Asian restaurants, a bunch of white people is usually not a good sign because that means that the food might not be authentic and made \"Americanized\". It was a packed house with about 50% white folks.. Got me a lil worried, but boy this time, the white folks must've known something the Asian population wasn't aware of... Rundown of our dishes:\n1) Tom Kum kah: coconut soup. Was ok. Nothing special.\n2) Garlic prawns: highlight of the evening. The seasoning was the perfect balance of salt, garlic, and pepper. The exact seasoning you would expect if you order Chinese style stir fried garlic crabs. The most surprising part of the dish was how it was prepared: with the prawn shelled but with the shell semi- attached at the tail. First, you eat the perfectly seasoned prawn. Then, you got to enjoy the bonus: the crispy prawn shell. Biting into the shell was like biting into a crispier version of chicharron ( crispy pig skin). I have never seen prawn prepared this way. WHY hasn't any other chef/ restaurant ever thought of that?!!! Lotus of Siam, thank you for this ingenious foresight......\n\n3) crispy duck in panang curry: we had originally planned to order the crispy duck with Chili n mint leaves, but our waiter suggested we order this version since we already had a similarly flavored dish. What great knowledge of the staff to provide helpful tips! He was dead on to make this suggestion. My friend krystal kept raving about the sauce. I think if she was not in public, she may have licked the plate!! LoL!!!\n\n4) drunken noodle with sea bass: at first we contemplated ordering this dish.. It was the most expensive thing we ordered at $30, but we were sold when a patron leaving the restaurant overheard our discussion and urged us to order it saying it was \"the reason why we come here\". With a reference put that way, we needed no further convincing! The sea bass was extremely fresh n flaky. The drunken noodles were perfectly wok'd: you could taste the \"fire\" of the wok. A sign that the wok has been well seasoned and the chef knows how to use that to intensify the foods being cooked in it. Awesome dish!\n\nAlas, we were too full to order dessert but the fried bananas with ice cream looked so good that we'll have to come back next time to try it. Oh YES, there will definitely be a NEXT time.. :)\n\nTotal for our party of 4: $103. Not bad at all.. I'd come here any day over a buffet!!"

Still questioning our dinner choice, we decided to wait.\n\nLooking at the menu, dishes were on the pricey side. Then I saw too many westerners to think this would be any good. While we waited, we watched dishes coming out and the portions looked tiny. The garlic prawns were $29! And the plate didn't even look that full. \n\nI would pass on the garlic prawns and the drunken noodles.\nBut the pad thai..... Possibly the best pad thai I've ever tasted!\n\nWas it worth the wait?

I was really happy because the last time I tried coming here the place was packed.\n\nAfter reading some of the review highlights here's what we ordered:\n\nTom Yum Kai (with coconut milk) - very simple soup with basil, mushrooms and chicken, but the soup was delicious. I can taste the lemongrass and coconut milk and it was just a little spicy.\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice) - Very interesting dish, I think it was a little to sour for me and not just from the sausage but it was nice to try something I've never had before.\n\nBeef saut\u00e9ed in a garlic cilantro pepper sauce, served on bed of green - beef slices were tender and I loved the sauce, this was my favorite dish but I wish they put more beef in it.\n\nKhao Soi (Burmese influence on Northern Thai egg noodle  with beef in a curry sauce and coconut cream) - I love Northern Thai food (Spicy BBQ in LA) and was happy to see a Northern Thai section. The beef was very juicy, a different cut from the garlic beef. This dish was a little more spicy but I loved it. After eating all the noodles we added the rice to mix with the curry sauce. Don't forget to use the limes, it made the dish better. This dish was my 2nd favorite.\n\nDrunken Noodle Seafood - this was ok, they did put in a lot of seafood but it wasn't mind blowing.\n\nDessert: A sample of Mango Sticky Rice, Fried Banana, and Coconut Ice Cream - I think this was the best sticky rice I've had! The coconut ice cream was very refreshing with small chunks of coconut. The fried bananas were good too, not too sweet.\n\nIncluding 2 beers and 2 Thai ice teas, tax and tip the bill was slightly over $100, I thought that was pretty pricey for Thai food. Especially when some of the dishes had smaller portions. However service was good and they were very friendly to us. I probably wouldn't have ordered the Drunken Noodles and tried another Northern Thai dish. \n\nI'd come back if I'm in the mood for Thai food on my next Vegas trip."

As with most things in life, you're expectations of quality are based on how much you pay for something.   When you're the most expensive Thai place in town, well, you expect the best.  \n\nWe ordered tempura (bad choice being this is a Thai spot) that tasted like something you would buy out of your supermarket frozen food section.  We followed it with their \"specialty\" plate, crispy chicken with panang sauce.  For $27 you get duck that tastes like Kentucky fried chicken strips dipped in a watery curry sauce.  The other plate, I believe no. 55, was strips of rubbery beef in a acidic and vile sauce.  Terrible to say the least.  \n\nIm hardly ever motivated to write reviews on food spots and hate being negative about things but maybe I can save a few souls from spending their hard earned money on sub par Thai food."

Overall, it was pretty awesome.\n\nLocation/venue: It's located in a seriouly shady part of town in a mall I would never go to alone. The venue like...an old tired Chinese restaurant. \n\nFood: I was actually slightly disappointed that not everything was out of this world delicous...here's the breakdown\n-Crispy duck with panang curry: This was hands down the star of our meal. It's one of their signature dishes and expectations were high...and they totally delivered. Duck was perfectly crispy and juicy and the curry! OH EM GEE SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. Perfectly balanced, creamy without being heavy. Good to the very last drop. We might as well have just licked the plate.\n-Garlic prawns: Another signature dish that was very good, though not as amazing as the duck with panang curry. the shrimp meat and shell are fried separately, which surprisingly makes everything yummy crunchy and edible. The shells were possibly even better than the meat of the prawns. \n-Soft shell crab with drunken noodle: this was disapointing, especially after the first two dishes. The soft shell crab was a bit soggy and the noodles were super soggy. In fact the noodles were all stuck together in sticky soggy bricks. I feel like I must have gotten an anomaly.\n-Sai Oua (norther style sausage): don't get this. it's just...a sausage. It wasn't special. I mean, if you know what it is and you like it, sure. But otherwise, it was super disappointing and just not very good.\n-Fried banana with coconut ice cream: So crispy, so yummy, the banana and the coconut ice cream were perfect complements!\n-Mango with sticky rice: Mango was beautifully deliciously silky ripe. sticky rice was  perfectly chewy and yummy. Both of the desserts were delicious. I was way beyond capacity full by dessert and I still finished every last bite of dessert!\n\nIf you come for the duck/curry, prawns, and dessert, it's PERFECT. 5 starts. However, I am disappointed that aside from the two signature dishes the rest of the entrees were any good. Their menu is actually quite extensive...wonder if how much of the menu is actually at the level of their 2 signature dishes?"

Just some advice, I got here at 5:25 and there was already a line, they open at 5:30pm. It wasn't bad but it was a Tuesday.. so I can imagine on the weekends it can get crazy. So on to the food..\n\nI started off with what I always start off with at any Thai place..\n\nTom Yum w/ Shrimp - This is the first thai place that i've been too that asks how spicy you want your Tom Yum.. 1-10 I got a 7 and it was decent, had a nice little kick to it.  The soup was super flavorful and probably one of the best Tom Yum soups i've had. \n\nFried Rice with sour sausage - Bomb.. this had alot of crazy flavors and textures going on.  A tad bit sour but not too much, crunchy peanuts, and lots of veggies mixed in made this dish amazing.\n\nPad See Ew - This dish was nothing special whatsoever.  It was lacking in flavor and I would not get this dish again.  Very average.. \n\nCRISPY DUCK w/ DRUNKEN NOODLES - this is supposed to be their best dish.. well the Crispy Duck is. You can have it different ways, I regret not getting the Crispy Duck in Panang Curry.. right before I walked in some caucasian guy told me that the drunken noodles was the best with crispy duck.. why did I listen to a caucasian guy at a thai restaurant when im asian and i've probably had more thai food then hes had in his entire life? I dont f**king know but I should have got it with panang curry, because I even asked the worker which is better and she told me panang is the most popular version of the crispy duck. So do not make the same mistake as I did and get it with curry!! Drunken noodles = pad see ew noodles! \n\nAnyway this place is a pretty good Thai restaurant and I will be back!"

I cannot come to Vegas and not take a detour to eat here.\n\nFirst, MAKE a reservation and make sure you can get there slightly before your reservation as they will only hold your table for 5 minutes.  There is still always a wait.  Anticipate about a $16-$18 cab ride from the strip and about 15-20 minutes to get there depending on traffic.  Try to not go on a Friday or Saturday as it is always overly packed. \n\nSecond, its not on the strip, it's in a mini mall in the middle of nowhere.  At first, you look at the outside and it looks like a place you are not sure you want to trust eating at, but trust me...you will thank me. \n\nThey have a pretty high tech checkin system with an iPad and they actually have things organized when you get in.\n\nNow for the food, when you get the menu go straight to the chef's specialties or the Northern selection.  It's what they specialize in so take advantage. \n\nThey will ask you a scale of 1-10 for spiciness..the food is SPICY.  A 10 is only for those who have replaced their stomach with Iron.  A jalapeno is more at a level 2, a habernero is at a level 5...Scotch bonnets are level 8...I don't even know what they use.  Mind you the spice is there but so is the taste..its not like you burned your mouth and then nothing.\n\nThe wine list is also pretty impressive for a strip mall thai restaurant.  And well priced.  For $150, you can easily feed 4 people with a reasonably good bottle of wine too. \n\nFood Recommendation: Short Ribs in Penang Sauce"

            "review": "Seriously? How have I never written a review for Lotus?\n\nThis is, without question, my absolute favorite restaurant in the world. If I'm ever on death row, this is my last meal. If I ever moved away from Vegas, Lotus is probably what i would miss the most. I have been eating there about twice a month for the five years I've been living in Vegas. On her third or fourth nomination, chef Saipin Chutima won the James Beard Award this year - but the secret has long been out about this amazing, otherworldly culinary experience 3/4 of a mile and worlds away from the Strip.\n\nAlmost everything I have ever eaten here is absolutely fantastic, and for spice junkies like myself it's a legitimate challenge. They operate on a 1-10 scale, but there's actually a spice level 15. I don't recommend it. But if you like some serious heat to your food, a 10 will kick your ass. The 15 is just unnecessary.\n\nAs for the dishes, almost all that I've ever had are fantastic. Here are my recommendations from the gargantuan, 150+ item menu:\n\n11. Garlic Pepper Chicken Wings. These are bursting with flavor from the fried garlic and the green onions that practically drip off the crispy wings. I'm not really much of a wing person but I can go to town on these.\n\n13. Nua Dad Deaw. This Issan style beef jerky is, in flavor and texture, completely different than any jerky you've ever had.\n\n14. Nam Kao Tod. The BEST DISH EVER, and I mean ever. I order this every single time I go. It's a sour sausage salad over crispy rice with a complex and vibrant flavor profile that includes the always distinct and recognizable tastes of green and red onions, peanuts, ginger, mint, cilantro, lime, basil and chili. Seriously, I've never seen this offered anywhere else and it's unlike any other food on earth. You've never seen so many flavors, colors and textures all in the same dish.\n\n55. Nua Nam Tok. Charbroiled beef on a flavorful and tangy mix of lime, rice powder and green onion.\n\n59. Koi Soy. This Issan style steak tartare is unbelievably good. The rice powder makes for an incredible texture contrast with the beef, and the lime and chili mix almost cooks the beef the way that the citric acid in a ceviche cooks the fish. This one gets really intense when you turn the spice level up on it.\n\n66. Issan Sausage. Let me tell you a little story about their Issan sausage, cured for weeks in-house with a mixture of pork, wine, garlic and spices. They ran out of it for a period of a few weeks a few summers back, and they were the longest weeks of my life. I craved it like a crack baby. It's a dry, sour sausage that's paired with ginger, peanuts, fresh chilis and red onions. This is probably about my 2nd most common entree order. Be sure to get some rice to mix it with, and wrap it up in a cabbage leaf. That's how it's eaten when served off street carts in Thailand.\n\n72. Mint and Green Chili. Heat of spice countered by cool mint. I daydream about this sometimes.\n\n79. Pepper Garlic Sauce. Emphasis on the garlic. Lots of green onions on this one too, that combination seems to work well.\n\n102. Pad Thai. I've never had a better version of this dish, which all too often tastes too much of tamarind. But this is a subtle blend of the dish's strong flavors. Never had better.\n\n107. Kai Koowah. Like a more flavorful, less salty chow fun.\n\n121. Spicy Fried Rice. I feel like a gringo because I order the spicy fried rice more than any other entree. But it is simply a flavorful delivery system for some of the most intensely flavorful but not overwhelming heat in the whole desert. (I always order this level 10 spicy. I don't F around.) The garlic, basil, and fresh chilis add a bolt of lightning to a savory bowl of fried rice. Again, the best of its kind.\n\nH. Nam Prik Noom. This green chili dip is the perfect choice for when you just want something light.\n\nThose are my go-tos on the Lotus menu, depending on my mood. There's a couple other things that need to be said about Lotus.\n\nThe wine list is mind-boggling and affordable. It's a special treat for lovers of German and Austrian Rieslings.\n\nThe lunch buffet should be skipped. If you get it, you're missing out on most of the things that make Lotus such a special dining destination. Although I would be lying if I said I had never had the lunch buffet and piled on plate after plate after plate of garlic chicken wings and the world's best pad thai. But I'm there twice a month or more, that's a luxury I have that most Lotus visitors don't.\n\nIf you only eat one meal in Vegas, make this it."

I had the Tom Kha Kai. Best I've ever had. It was the perfect balance of sweet and spice, I ordered a 10, and it seemed to grace my tongue like silk. The coconut and lemongrass danced on my tongue like a beautiful ballerina. There was no overpowering of flavors, no, only complimenting like Kanye speaks of Kanye. \n\nYes, I exaggerate but you know food is good when you think about it every time a Sade or Adele song comes on."

            "review": "I can't say this is the best Thai food I've ever eaten but they have a huge selections of items, some of which I have never tasted before.  There has also been a lot of press about this place.  I didn't realize that these were the same owners who opened up Renu Nakorn in Norwalk, CA.  They sold it years ago, though the restaurant it still open.  No wonder some of the menu items seemed similar.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for two on a Sunday night and ordered:\n\n-Nam Kao Tod - Loved the crunchy pieces of rice though it was a very sour dish.  Size was average.\n-Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip) - This was not as spicy as it looked.  In fact, it was barely spicy.  It came with really fresh vegetables and pork rinds.  The dip itself tasted very similar to a spaghetti sauce to me.\n-Kana Moo Krob (Pork Belly + Chinese Broccoli) - Can't go wrong with this dish.  Yummy but not very different from other places I've had this dish at.\n-Sai Oui (Sausage) - This also had a mild kick to it but barely.  It had a strong lime taste - I didn't care for this one too much, but I am not a sausage fan in general.\n\nWe didn't try any of the standard Thai dishes (i.e. Pad Thai) bc we wanted to try things that weren't readily available in Thai Town (LA).  We also ordered a lemongrass drink - the first waiter had no idea what we were talking about but a second one knew.  I guess they don't have a regular drink menu, and I only knew about the drink bc of a Yelp review (thanks again, Yelp!).  Overall service was good and food was a bit more expensive than your average Thai restaurant."

            "review": "I've been meaning to sign up for Yelp for a while, but my experience at Lotus of Siam made it happen. I lived in Thailand for about 7 months including Chiang Mai (where I found out the owner is from) for 3. I've never tasted Thai food in America that comes close to the street food out there, until I tried Lotus of Siam. \n\nWe got the Khao Soi, Tom Yum Gai, Pad Thai, and Panang Curry. Everything was perfect. It's as authentic as it gets, which I can see turning off some people who are used to Americanized Thai food, but everyone in our group loved it. The soup was the perfect balance of sour and spicy. Khao Soi is one of my favorite foods and I don't remember the last time I saw it on a menu - Lotus of Siam did it perfectly. The Pad Thai and Curry were great too.\n\nPrices were reasonable for the quality and they had a surprisingly good beer selection (at a great price for craft beers). Our waitress and the rest of the staff were very friendly. It was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while. If I lived in Vegas I'd eat here multiple times per week. Only downside is you need a car or a long taxi ride to get there, and while the place was beautifully decorated, the boxes of wine stored behind the glass didn't look great in an otherwise impressive display. That is a very minor issue that I probably only notice because I work in the industry. There seem to be a lot of Thai places in Vegas but this should definitely be the one to try."

And their Northern dishes really stand out as well. \n\nStand outs that we've ordered: \nKoong Sarong (prawn in blanket)\nGarlic Prawns, yes, they are just fantastic as all the reviews have stated. \nCharbroiled Prawns\nSuki Scallops (or Seared Scallops with garlic pepper or chilli basil)\nSliced catfish\nFried/Steamed fish and lobster dishes, while I have not yet tried them, seem wonderful as well. \n\nThey have an incredibly impressive, noteworthy, actually, wine selection/wine room -- particularly whites -- that pair so well with their dishes. \n\nIf you are visiting Vegas or live in Vegas and truly want to be wowed, treat yourself at this absolute gem."

Food, the way it's meant to be enjoyed - with others.\n\nI'm still struggling with an internal debate of whether the place is overrated or if it is because we didn't get to try EVERYTHING on the menu... :P\n\nMake reservations! The place fills up and you'll need them if you wish to eat.\n\nI didn't get to try the buffet, but I hear that it is only offered for lunch and the quality/food is different (note... not better or worse).\n\nMy friend and I ordered foods that we typically order from other Thai restaurants (for comparison purposes). We had the pad thai, pad see ew, green curry and drunken noodle with seafood.\n\nI'm a little indifferent about the pad thai. My friend and I noticed that the tamarand sauce wasn't as strong so more of the other flavors came through (oils, peanuts, tofu, etc.). This can be interpreted as being a little more bland, but also appreciated since it wasn't overwhelming. My friend said that he's had better green curry. I haven't, but then again I haven't had too much of a comparison. The drunken noodle seafood was GREAT! With a plethora of seafood sprinkled all over a mound of noodles (flat rice noodles). This was all covered with gravy and makes my mouth water even now. The pad see ew was also delicious!\n\nI will be returning. In this next trip I hope to try their soft-shelled crab, lobster, beef jerky and catfish... I can't wait!\n\nBe ware... the strip mall/neighborhood isn't the greatest...."

I live in Tucson, Arizona- the land of Sonoran hot dogs, thousands of Mexican eateries and like five very mediocre Thai restaurants and one extra crappy one. So LOS really hit the spot and somehow we managed to get a table within fifteens minutes after arriving on a Saturday night! The service was a little odd, though. We had one server who took our order and didn't come back until we paid. The rest of the time we had a busser working his tail off. We don't quite know who got the tip. Our food was delicious. We ordered green curry with beef, pad Thai with Chicken, the special mango salad with shrimp, chat broiled prawns, and saut\u00e9ed veggies. The green curry wast personal favorite and it was super spicy. I'm never sure what to expect , so we went with medium and it was definitely on the high end of medium spice. My only quibble were the portion sizes. A touch on the small side but satisfying and fresh nonetheless. I ordered a Singha to drink but their wine list is certainly expansive. I'd skip most restaurants on the strip and take the short cab ride to this place. Plan ahead and try to make a reservation. We simply got lucky with out short wait time. I can't wait to come back for a bigger tasting of their menu. But this first visit was worth reviewing and it did not disappoint."

We came here for lunch and arrived around noon and there was a line out the door. Some of the people were there for the lunch buffet and after looking at it, I didnt want to waste a meal on cheap fried stuff. The place is pretty big and we were seated with the sit down side and noticed that more people do that than buffet. Overall, the food is pretty authentic but too bad we werent able to explore more of the authentic dishes.\n\nGarlic prawns- These bad boys are quite expensive at $22 but they are fried and yummy. I couldnt help but eat the fried shell as well. They werent spicy and did have some flavor to it but I did have a tummy ache after all the fried stuff. I say if you are a fan of seafood, then go ahead and give it a try. Since I am not an avid fan of it, I could have easily passed on it and tried an entree but my yelper self had to try.\n\nNam Kao Tod- This is an appetizer that Yelp told me to get. I would not reorder this. It is fried crispy rice pieces that have a sour lemon taste to it. I do not particularly like the flavor and it is not something I would ever crave. I would pass.\n\nTofu pad see ew- Average and nothing special about it. I liked the veggies in it though.\n\nMango sticky rice+ coconut ice cream- These are sold separately but they put them on the same plate. This dish is always awesome and it tastes like the others I have tried. The sticky rice isnt that sweet which is nice because you have the mangoes and ice cream with it.\n\nOverall, it is a good Thai place in Vegas and I guess it is similar to Krung Thai in San Jose. Nothing crazy status but a good change than the regular buffet."

We gave up and took a taxi, which set us back by about $15 round trip, including tip. Our taxi driver asserted that the shopping center that the Lotus of Siam is situated in is the first shopping center in Vegas. I haven't fact-checked him, but it did seem like it'd been around for quite some time, especially the funky parking and overall traffic layout.\n\nJon A. and I picked out three dishes (with the help of our server), and I opted to try the Thai lime drink. The dishes included a bowl of Tom Yum Plar Dook (hot and sour soup with catfish, lime juice, lemongrass and straw mushrooms), roasted duck curry, and beef Khao Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles in curry sauce and coconut cream with your choice of beef or chicken, served with a side of with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables). Including Jon's soft drink, we ended up $45 lighter, including tax and tip.\n\nEverything was delectable, but we suspected that they may have mixed up our spice-level orders. Jon's spiciness tolerance level is much higher than mine, so we ordered the communal soup and my roasted duck curry as a six, and the Khao Soi was to be a ten. However, after profusely sweating through the catfish soup and hoping I'd be able to handle my curry, we realized that the soup was probably the ten and the entrees both ended up sixes. Oh, well: everything was delicious, and I'd go back and order that soup at a ten again. The heat from both temperature and spiciness really hit the spot! And the Thai lime drink? Well, it was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it was nice to cool off with while working on that soup.\n\nDon't expect much from the atmosphere, but that hardly matters. The crowds spoke by filling up the place by 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening. (Luckily we arrived before the swarms did. And the swarms had a wait of 45 minutes when we were leaving.) The service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant, but don't expect utter perfection.\n\nThe verdict: Excellent Thai restaurant! It ranks up there on my favorites. Not sure when I'll be back in Vegas, but if I do find myself on the Strip, then I'll be sure to stop in at the Lotus again."

Hot Thai and cool wines?  Sign me up.\n\nI loved my meal.  What we got:\n* Tom yum shrimp: I ordered this spicy.  It was very spicy, just the way I like it (hotter than eating a jalapeno straight).  The flavors popped and the straw mushrooms soaked up the broth.\n* Nam Prik Noom (Green Chili dip): Couldn't pass this up.  Tasty, but not all that spicy.  I'd definitely get it again.\n* Red Curry Chicken: Delicious and spicy.  I was getting pretty full at this point, but I finished.\n\nThe wines were also great and pretty affordable.  Unfortunately, it's hard for me to remember the names of German wines but I assure you: they were good and I tried a few varietals I hadn't seen before.  I'd bet some people would find it worthwhile to go here for the wine list alone.\n\nShe says:  I was in a delicious food and wine coma -- I will add details as they come back to me.  The Tom Yum was sharp in all the right ways.   Service was impeccable."

I was starting to think there was something wrong with me.  \n\nMy client is a very well-known food critic, and knowing how much I love Thai food, he kept telling me that I needed to go to Lotus of Siam on my next Vegas trip.  \"The absolute best Thai in America,\" he insisted.\n\nSo I trust him.  He knows his ethnic food.  And on my next trip to Vegas, I made a point of going to Lotus of Siam.  And not only was it not the best Thai food in America, it wasn't even the best Thai food in Las Vegas.  Everything I ordered was way below standard from what I've had in this country and in Thailand.  Granted, I'm vegan, so my food was sans fish sauce, but still, I've had damn good vegan Thai in New York, Chicago, LA, and Chiang Mai.  This stuff didn't even come close.  My dining partner went so far as to say his food was \"disgusting.\" I wouldn't go that far, but I was really not impressed.  \n\nWe ordered appetizers, entrees, and we even ordered the famed  sticky rice with mango that several of the food critics glowed about in their articles that wallpaper the entrance (you have plenty of time to read them all while you wait for your table-- the place is packed).  Even that  wasn't good, and they didn't have to alter any of the ingredients for me to eat it.\n\nWhen I came back to LA, I told my client about my experience.  He was shocked.  \"You're the only person I've ever met who didn't have a life-changing experience there,\" he mused.  \n\nI  don't know.  Maybe it was the chef's day off.   Maybe they hate vegans.  Maybe my taste buds were off.   But last time I was in Vegas, I went to the almost-empty Thai place across the shopping center from Lotus and had a much better meal.  I guess there's just no accounting for taste."

I went there on a weeknight at 8:30pm, thinking I was late enough to be able to get in without waiting, but found out I had to wait FORTY FIVE MINUTES! That is how popular this place is. I ended up leaving and making a reservation for dinner 2 days later. If you want to eat here at dinner without a wait, you MUST call in advance!\n\nOur waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the menu items, since nobody in my group was familiar with thai food. He was very patient and gave us helpful suggestions, and our water was always promptly filled. Thank goodness for that, because the food was HOT.\n\nMy group likes spicy food, so we asked for our dishes to be prepared to a 5, 7, and 8 on the 1-10 spiciness scale. IT. WAS. INTENSE. Hence my drinking 3 glasses of water, and thank goodness my waiter was prompt in refilling my water because I might've died otherwise. If you ask for a number higher than 5, know what you're getting into: A 10 would be practically nuclear. \n\nI can't recommend the fried catfish enough. It's one of their specialties, and for good reason. We ordered fried catfish with basil. The catfish pieces were so tender and flavorful, they tasted like a much more expensive fish. Any of the curries is also delicious. One dish I do not recommend is any of the dips. For $10, all you get is a plate of blanched vegetables (which are pretty fresh, to their credit) and a cold \"dip\" which is often more like a salad. But the other items we had more than made up for this miss. \n\nI always imagine dives like lotus of siam to have giant portions, but the servings here are small, rendering the restaurant more expensive than the menu prices would suggest. It's enough, but you probably won't have leftovers. \n\nAll in all, this place truly impressed me. I've never had thai food better than this!"

It took me at least 15 minutes to decide what I wanted to order because everything sounded so good.  There was sooo much stuff that I really wanted to try.  I ended up going w/ some spicy catfish over lettuce (forgot what it was called, but it was good).  We also had a spicy catfish soup and stuffed chicken wings.  The portions are pretty good sized, so it was a lot of food.  The 4 of us were stuffed.  After the appetizers before our entrees came, we decided to order their crab fried rice too (which my friend told me was awesome), they took our order for that and our entrees came out.. and we got full halfway through eating it.  We could barely eat anymore... luckily our waiter knew that and didn't put the order in yet, thank god.  \n\nThe food here is VERY spicy, watch out for how spicy you order things.  It's from 1-10, and the 7 is extremely hot, even though i eat spicy food all the time.  The soup we ordered was 7, and i was dying and sweating non stop.  I asked if they had milk to cool down the spicyness, and the waiter laughed at me :( (as did everyone else at the table).  then i asked if i could change my entree from a 7 to a 2, and he said no too late, and laughed again :(.  But i was soooo happy he was just kidding when he brought my entree out and they changed it.  I think the next time I go, i'd probably go with a 4.\n\nThe wait was kind of long though, about 45 minutes, but well worth it.  We tried to make reservations, but it was a Friday night and they said they didnt take them that night.  \n\nThe service was awesome... The waiter was really nice and friendly, made lots of recommendations, checked on us all the time even though they were extremely busy.\n\nPrice wasn't bad, they have lots of entrees between $10 - $20.  For the four of us, with drinks, entrees, appetizers, and soup, it was $140 total w/ tax.\n\nAlso not only is the menu huge, the wine list has a very large selection too.\n\nI'm definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Vegas."

There are something like 130 or 140 menu items to choose from and the prices are incredibly reasonable -- especially considering how popular this place is. It's not remotely fancy inside and the location is in a dirty shopping center in a bad part of town, but the food is unbelievably exceptional. \n\nReservations are definitely recommended if you want to eat on a weekend evening at a preferable dining hour, but don't give up if you call ahead and the receptionist says they're booked. Simply walk in around 9-9:15 (they close at 10) and you probably won't wait for more than 20 minutes or so. Ask the receptionist and she'll tell you the same thing.\n\nAnd if you're looking for some cheap after-dinner entertainment, I suggest sitting in your car for a few minutes and checking out the people coming and going from \"The Green Door\" (the supposedly world famous swingers club inside the same shopping center). The people watching from the parking lot there is almost as great as the food at Lotus of Siam. Enjoy!"

This will be a regular stop when we come to town. The only negative was the frantic and chaotic yet really inefficient service- strange..."

I had to ice my tongue for the next 15 minutes, and couldn't taste the sexy food for that duration.  I think the waitress felt bad as she walked around and saw my whole group dying from the spiciness.  Unfortunately, the food got cold, and wasn't as yummy.\n\nPlates my group ordered (1-5 scoring):\n\n1.  Sea Bass - 4, very very good, but small portions\n2.  Curry (forgot which one, probably yellow) - 4.5\n3.  Duck with some curry - 5\n4.  Tom Ka (I think) - 5\n5.  Spicy sausage - 3\n6.  Soft shell crab over noodles - 3.5\n\nI would definitely go here again.  With a group of 6, I think we ended up paying about $25/person, which is a bit pricey for Thai, but I'd rather go here than most places on the strip."

First of all, the location is pretty weird. It's in a run-down strip mall and the entrance is in the back. Anyway, it took a LONG while to get there from the Strip as we had to take the Deuce bus and then walk for a while before we found it. So, finally we're there and we're expecting to have a religious experience. Not so. Basically, it was a regualy buffet---I didn't even think it was Thai food for the most part! So, next time we're in Vegas, we're going for dinner. Yes, I'm willing to give it another shot. Seems to me that the great reviews are based on dinner, NOT the buffet."

Stuffed chicken wings ($10.95) were better -- juicy and a nice portion for two.\n\nGarlic Prawns ($21.95) were excellent, as was the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle ($29.95).  Both are deep-fried so skip sides or unnecessary carbs.  The prawns come with white rice, and the drunken noodle is more than adequate.  Portions are not huge but are filling.\n\nRECOMMENDED."

I had it on three dishes: the catfish, with minced chicken on the pad kee mao, and later on a whole fried red snapper. Sauce is right on the money.\n\nThe green papaya salad is my favorite I've ever had. Crisp, well marinated: it bursts with flavor. Make sure you get it spicy though. We got it medium, and one time it was fairly hot, the next time it was not hot enough. I would err on the side of too spicy next time. Nice ripe tomato bits in it also.\n\nI liked the Crisp Rice Salad with Minced Sour Sausage, but dining partner wasn't impressed. I thought it had interesting texture to the rice with a concentrated flavor, though the sausage looked more like ham.\n\nWe also tried the Northern Larb...also a flavor concentration and quite good. It has minced pieces of pork and spices: very tasty but a little unusual.\n\nOh, Pad Woon Sen with shrimp was wonderful but it's hard to mess that up.\n\nOnly disappointment for me was the Khao Soi (yellow curry with rice noodles)...it was OK, but didn't stand out among others I've had.\n\nDefinitely finish the meal with the coconut ice cream. Home-made, rich, luxurious, perfect slightly melted temperature, small frozen bits of coconut embedded. This actually is what drew us back to LOS for a 2nd day in a row. \n\nSo although I'm a bit Las Vegas-ed out right now, LOS may lure me back sooner than I plan."

            "review": "My wife wanted to try Thai tonight.  So, off on Yelp we went and we found the reviews on Lotus of Siam.  Based on what we read, it sounded great and we went to check it out.\n\nFirst off, it was quite a hike from where we live to the restaurant (45 minutes).  It is not located in a very pristine area.  In fact, questionable would be a nice word.  The only good part of the location is that it is in an outside shopping mall.  As a result, there were plenty of parking.  When we arrived, there were not a lot of cars there.\n\nWe made reservations for Friday @ 5:30pm (opening time).  By the way, MAKE reservations.  Otherwise, good luck on getting a table.  When we got there, there already was a line about 15-20 people deep.  That is a great sign.  Somehow, people waiting outside kinda reminds me of the Disney flick/cartoon -- Ratatouie (you know at the end of the movie where the crowd is waiting to get in).  By the way, if you do not have reservations, depending on how busy they are, you may be turned down.  They turned a few people away due to \"no availability\".\n\nBecause of the early dinner and the reservation, we had no problems getting a table and were seated within a few minutes.  Walking into the restaurant, you notice immediately how clean and big the restaurant is.  The staff were very courteous and friendly.  I was definitely impressed.  \n\nNow, on to the food, the 3 of us ordered a variety of items and shared amongst us.  By the way, there was a table of 8 family members next to us, they all ordered their own dish and did not share.  I can not imagine us doing this.  I would be tempted to taste and try every possible dish that I can.  Anyways, this is what we ordered: \n\nAppetizers:\na.  Tom Yum Coconut Soup w/ Chicken.  Compared to a lot of Thai restaurants that I have been, this was on the scale of AVERAGE.  It was okay and nothing to brag about.  Would I order this again... probably not -- I would preferred to try something else.  It was good average... I give this a mid to low 3 stars.\n\nb.  #14 - Nam Kao -- okay, we ordered this because of the reviews.  It is basically sliced ginger, mixed with some fried type of crouton/rice/bread (hard to pinpoint), green onions, red onions, papayas, and some other stuff.  I guess this is sort of a hit or miss.  You either like it or not.  Honestly, I was not a fan.  In fact, I thought this was the worst dish of the night.  I give this a mid 2 stars.\n\nc.  Beef salad -- this was the star of our dinner.  By far and away the best dish of the night.  If I knew, I would have ordered 2-3 of these puppies.  The beef was cooked to perfection ~ medium rare.  And, it was seasoned to perfection.  The only issue that I had was that it was very spicy (for a #2 spice level).  I must have drained 3 large glasses of water.  But, this was well worth it.  My first 5 stars.\n\nEntrees:\na.  Drunken Sea Bass w/ Noodles -- okay, this dish was about 29.95.  It was a bit pricey; however, based on the review, we had to try it.  And, quite frankly, this was a very good dish.  The Sea Bass was soft, tender, and flaky.  And, the right mixture of sweetness and season was mixed in with the noodles. But, I did not think this should have been a $29.95 dish.  It is a bit steep.  For this, I grade it as a low 4-4.25 stars.\n\nb.  Fried Prawns -- this was by far the most original dish.  They basically take these jumbo sized shrimp (think size 10-15) and peel the skin back.  Best way to explain this is to think of a horizontal line.  On one end of the shrimp is the shrimp meat and on the other is the peeled shell side.  They marinate the whole shebang in some salty sauce and deep fry it.  What you get is a fried shrimp with the shell attached.  You eat both the meat and the shell.  It was quite tasty.  However, I have to say that I wished they had a dip for this - something tangy would be a nice fit .. i.e. sweet and sour would do.  For originality and taste, I give them a high 4 stars or low 5 stars.\n\nDesserts:\na.  Fried Banana -  If I had to do it again, I would not order this.  It was okay.... also, we were a bit too full to eat this -- doggy bag time.  2-3 stars.\\\n\nb.  Sweet Rice with Mangos -- this was not too original.  I was not into the rice; however, I have to admit that the mangos were very sweet.  I give this a mid 3-star rating for the mangos.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty cool experience.  The service was excellent.  We had some dishes that were okay, but we also had some amazing and original dishes as well.  Dinner total for 3 (no drinks - except water) totaled to 106 dollars.  With tip, it added up to $125 in all.  3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts -- hmm, not a bad price at all!  I would give this a solid 4 with room to move up to 5 star status...\n\nBTW, as we walked out around 7pm, the whole restaurant was packed and the parking lot was filled with Lotus of Siam patrons.\n\nWe definitely would be back.  And, we look forward to trying other dishes.\n\nCheers!!!"

After our first visit  many years ago, I figured it would be a nice treat to go back.\n\nAfter making reservations for a Thursday evening, they told us they would only hold the reservation for 5 minutes because they are that busy.  Okay.\n\nWe were a party of six - four adults and two kids.  \n\n* Chicken Dumplings ($6.95) -   Basic deep fried wontons with chicken and vegetables and served with a sweet chili sauce.  This order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies.\n\n* Our friend recently had a Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad ($13.95) at another Thai place and wanted to try their version.  When he saw the presentation, he was immediately disappointed.  The pieces were a bit larger than he would have hoped and it was just an okay salad taste-wise.\n\n* The Husband was certain about one dish in particular - the Crispy Duck Curry.  (He loved it before and that's all he could remember.)  When the waiter heard this, he insisted we order the Crispy Panang Curry instead and assured us we would LOVE it.  (It also cost $20.95.)  I asked him if he was certain we really would and he said yes.  We thought it was just alright...and not really worth the $21 cost of it especially.  Sure, it was tasty but I've had better panang curry in Vegas for a fraction of the price.\n\n* We also opted for something from the Chef Specials - the Red Snapper.  Sure, it was a whole snapper at market price, which ended up being $35.  Our friend couldn't believe it when he discovered how much they charged for it.\n\nWhen the waiter initially took our order, he asked what our spice level choice was.  We wanted the salad and curry mild since the kids would be eating it.  However, it was far from mild and we were unable to serve it to the children.  As we neared the conclusion of our meal, we wanted to add another dish.  We asked the waiter for some suggestion and he mostly focused on things from the Chef Specials that were market price or didn't appeal to us.  We ultimately decided we were done with the meal.  \n\nI did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hoping for a saving grace but there was nothing exciting on there and our visiting friends were done with their Lotus experience at this point.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing visit.  Sure, they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leaves us wanting more. Maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes?  We probably won't be coming back here anytime soon."

            "review": "Last week, I had the choice of any reasonable place in Las Vegas for my graduation lunch. Having only had the lunch buffet before at Lotus of Siam, I decided to atone for my past errors in judgment.\n\nI had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.\n\nThe food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce\n\nAfter recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.\n\nI think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.\n\nHaving finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying."

Back a visitor I ate dinner here, and am very glad I did.\n\nWe had reservations at Lotus on a Thursday at 8:00 pm.  As many Yelpers note, it's in a non-descript shopping center on East Sahara.  When we opened the door the place was jumping.  It's large, with seating throughout the restaurant.  Despite the crowd we were seated immediately, even a couple of minutes before our reservation.  A man who wasn't our server but we saw several times during the evening took our drink order.  He brought us our water as well as a bottle of wine.  The Lotus wine list isn't enormous, but it's diverse enough for the majority of wine drinkers.  There are a few options by the glass and very reasonably priced bottles.  I think I've become jaded by Strip pricing when it comes to wines by the bottle.  But, there aren't any unknown gems or incredible wines on the list, but you will likely find something you like for far less than you'd pay elsewhere.\n\nThe menu was overwhelming to us.  Daunting, even.  So, we asked our server what dishes he recommended we try on our first visit.  For appetizers, we had the crispy rice and crispy garlic black pepper chicken wings.  For the spice level on the rice, we requested a 6/10.  When the dish arrived and we tried it, it was incredibly hot.  We should have calibrated our request for Thai cuisine, we were expecting a different level of heat to say the least.  But, the dish was fantastic, very crispy and flavorful with the cubes of sausage and green onions.  I'd order this dish again at a 6/10, I would just prepare myself for the heat.  The garlic pepper wings were pretty standard, very crispy skin and flavorful.  But, the appetizer winner for me was the crispy rice.\n\nFor dinner, we split:  the drunken noodle sea bass, garlic prawns, crispy duck with curry cause, and a beef dish that I can't remember the name.  It had a bunch of veggies and a spicy sauce, I know that.  My favorites were, in order:  the duck, the sea bass, the prawns, the beef.  The crispy duck was tender with a very crispy skin, impressive given it was coated in sauce.  The sauce, by the way, was probably the best curry I've had.  I could come to Lotus and only get this dish and leave happy.\n\nThe sea bass had flavorful noodles along with a tender and flaky sea bass.  Excellent fish.  The fried prawns were very crispy and the garlic sauce is fantastic.  i could have used more of it.  The beef was good, but it paled in comparison to the other dishes.  \n\nFor dessert, we tried fried bananas, which were good, but not very sweet.  But, I didn't come to Lotus for the dessert, so it wasn't a huge deal that I didn't love it.\n\nBe advised that the dishes come out very fast.  It won't take you long to have a meal.  Very glad I finally tried this Las Vegas institution and will likely be back on future trips.  Its lofty reputation is well-deserved."

It's weird for those waiting for a table to stare you down. All the windows are covered up so you're in this big recreation feel kind of room.\n\nTo the food. Menu was quite extensive and Authentic than most typical Americanized Thai restaurants. We ordered a pot of tom yum soup. The server should wait until the soup is fairly hot enough before serving our first bowl. It was barely lukewarm and tasted too fishy. Then we had a larb salad. Flavors on point but the herbs were old and wilted. Our last dish was the famous fried crispy prawn. I like how the shell was pulled back for the extra crunch. For price, it was way overpriced for ten shrimps. Overall, the food was pretty good and well worth the visit.\n\nMost importantly, make reservation and they will hold your table for 10 minutes. They will also send you a text reminder. That's pretty cool."

Look it up.\n\nThe food beyond makes up for the area, though.  We shared the spicy Thai wings, which were amazing.  I had the roasted duck curry with a heat level of 6 (out of 10), and it was like I died and went to curry heaven.  Le sigh.\n\nI'm a big fan of all things spicy, and I thought the 6 was just about perfect.  Hot enough to make me sit up and notice, but not so hot I couldn't taste the delicious curry and duck.  I could've probably handled a 7 or 8, but I would've had tears in my eyes.\n\nHands down, this is some of the best Thai food I've had.  Ever.  And I eat a lot of Thai food.\n\nOddly enough, they actually have a great wine list, so if you're interested in that, it's a cool experience.

Me. In a minivan. Oh, and the strip mall too... and no, there weren't strippers at the strip mall) on Sahara. As I hustled to the door (it was very cold!) the small, completely unassuming store front seemed quiet for a Wednesday night. And then I opened the door. \n\nThe place was positively cavernous, given the little entryway. I put my name down and went to sit at the bar while I waited the estimated 30 minute wait (it was less!). The bustle of the place is amazing. The smells, the service... there's a great energy and an extensive list of beers and wines to get you started. \n\nEarlier in the night DH had told me to ask if they had a tasting menu (they don't, but what a great idea!) so that I could try more things. It was only by the stroke of luck that my neighbours at the bar and I shared a similar last name, country of origin, and is turns out, passion for food. When we were seated next to eachother, they ever so graciously shared their appetizer (heaven on a plate) and I shared my tom ka kai (holy crap was that good).  The Ginger Sea Bass was perfectly delicate. You'd expect the thai flavours to overwhelm the fish, but instead it was perfectly balanced and prepared, with the fish still having just the right bite.\n\nI'm a Pad Kee Mao aficionado. I eat it everywhere I can because it's my favorite and I'm always looking for the most amazing one. And thanks to my new super BFFs, I got to try not one, but two ways that Lotus of Siam excels at it - one with prawns and one with crispy duck. People, you can not go wrong. Order either. Order both. Eat all the things. \n\nI will absolutely, positively, with 100% certainty be back. Because there is soo much more to try and everything was truly flawless (including the service!)"

I bet many of you think WTF are you doing ordering fly lice at a Thai restaurant.  We'll don't knock it till you try it.  Some may judge this dish as a garlic salty rice crispy treat?  Pretty bad comparison, but hey if you don't believe me go try it.  \n\nUm - Crispy Shrimp.  At first bite, I didn't eat the shell.  The shrimp is de-veined and shell left on.  Then deep fried in a white pepper salt duo mixture.  Our waiter walked by and said...try the skin.  It's like popcorn shrimp.  The shell literally melts in your mouth.  I'm like whoa nellie shut the front door.   \n\nO.M.G. - Crispy Duck Penang.  This dish is worth the price of admission.  This duck puts any Peking Duck to shame.  Even Ming Tsai's.  Sorry buddy.

Why haven't we been here before?  \n\nAre you kidding me? - Drunken noodles.  By this part of the meal, I've grossly over-eaten and feel like a hog ready to be pit roasted.  I think the secret ingredient in this dish is the Mekong River water they use to cook...oh wait....that's in Thailand where they use river water.  Nevermind.  And there's no mekong river in thailand.  Anyway...I'm almost 1000% sure she has her own private herb garden.  Cuz that basil is the shiznit.  \n\nWell that's it for now.

The tamarind sauce I could not make out the tamarind taste it tasted more like maple syrup, which I know they added to help sweetened the sourness of the tamarind.\n\nWe next had the Pad Thai. I have never been too much a fan of this dish, but this was very good and I would have to say the best version of it I have ever had. It is rich in flavor, nice and thick and very tasty.\nWe next had the Chili Mussels with a chili, garlic, Thai basil sauce over the large half shell mussels. I really liked these; they were not too spicy and had a great fresh flavor.\n\nWe finished off the meal with a mango and sticky rice dessert; it was just fresh mango slices with sticky rice on the side.

It's a true gem and no one I've ever taken here has ever been disappointed which I can't say for the likes of Guy Savoy. The two standouts are the Tom Kom Gai soup and the mango and sticky rice dessert!"

The hot and sour soup is amazing and I could eat bowls of it. \nThe curry chicken is also great, and it's one of a few excellent entrees on the lunch buffet. Another is the pad thai, which I did not love. The orange chicken is also very good, especially paired with the fried rice. \nFor dessert, there are cookies, fruit and YUMMY fried bananas wrapped in dough.  For $10.99, you could spend hours at the buffet and try everything. It really is a bargain, and everyone should try it once!"

It had the awesome spicy factor we loved! The Drunken Noodles w/seafood was disappointing cuz the dish was so greasy...granted we were super full from the meal but based on my BF and our visits to many other Thai places in SoCal..we can't rightly say this was the BEST Thai food we've had...we might have to give it another try on our next visit..."

I'm an avid Thai food eater so this place was definitely where I wanted to eat for my first non-partying weekend in Vegas. I went in on a rainy Friday evening, around 6:50pm, the weekend of the Pacquiao vs Bradley 3 boxing match. They quoted me for a wait time of 30mins but we actually got called to be seated in 3mins. They have an automated system where they text you when you're table is ready. \n\nThe inside was nice and cozy. I really like the glass wine case that you see when you walk in. The lighting was dim but not too dark to set the ambiance just right. The place seemed clean although I don't know how much I trust carpet in a restaurant..\n\nWe ordered a Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, beef Penang curry, and a Thai tea. They brought out the 2 noodle dishes first and then the curry. I ordered beef penang but the waiter brought out chicken. A minor hiccup, I simply told the waiter I had ordered beef and so he had it changed for me. \n\nI judge a Thai restaurant by their Pad Thai and their Thai tea. I must say I was a little disappointed with the pad Thai. It was a little dry and lacking in flavor. The Thai tea was great though. The beef Penang curry was good. I got a 3 on their spicy-ness scale and it was perfect for me. The Pad See Ew dish was the best thing we ordered though. It was moist and flavorful. I would definitely order the Pad See Ew over the Pad Thai the next time I come here."

            "review": "OMFG.  The best Thai food I have EVER had! In Vegas, who knew?!\n\nWe came here with a large group so we tried several dishes.  First off, service is really great and friendly.  Our server made a lot of great suggestions and had no problem answering our questions about dishes.  We had the deep-fried garlic prawns, khao soi (curry noodle dish), sai oua (sausage), red and green chili dips, kang hung lay (beef stew), crispy duck with panang sauce, sea bass with ginger, pad thai, and some sticky rice.  \n\nThe prawns were superb, deep-fried but not greasy at all and the batter has some great seasoning.  For me the khao soi was the standout dish, everyone loved it and by the end of the meal people were spooning up the curry sauce to eat over rice because it was so good.  I also highly recommend the chili dips.  The green chili was my favorite and reminded me of Mexican green chili because it came with tiny little pork rinds to eat with it. The sai oua had a great flavor.  When you bring it up to your mouth to eat it, you can catch a whiff of the aromatics it's spiced with.  I also really enjoyed the crispy duck and the sea bass was perfectly cooked and tender.  I really enjoyed my meal here.  And dessert was fantastic as well. I highly suggest getting the combo desert plate which comes with crispy fried bananas (they look like fried spring rolls with banana inside instead of veggies) and coconut ice cream over sticky rice.  Heavenly.\n\nIf you come here and are overwhelmed by the expansive menu, I would highly recommend being adventurous and ordering mainly off the Northern Thai and Chef's Choice menus.  Parking is plentiful, and because there are quite a few bars and clubs in the immediate area, grabbing a cab back to the Strip is not very difficult.  I highly recommend making a reservation because there seems to be a serious wait otherwise.  Definitely worth the 2 mile trip off the Strip for great quality That cuisine. The hype is all true!"

Well, this isn't a fancy restaurant, it's not in a nice area, and nobody should ever get the buffet.\n\nIf you do go here, don't order items that you have enjoyed at your neighborhood Thai restaurant back home.  The best items on the menu here are the ones that you probably have never eaten before.  A lot of the things that are staples at Thai restaurants are served at Lotus of Siam, but they are not done with a flourish and they might even be disappointing.\n\nI've eaten at this restaurant about a dozen times, and there have been some mediocre meals and some truly outstanding meals.  The charbroiled beef dishes are all excellent, the seafood dishes are consistently great, and some of the curries are interesting and delicious.  There are some good dishes on the Northern menu, but there have been some that I haven't enjoyed as much.  The first time I went to Lotus of Siam I ordered the crispy rice appetizer, and I have ordered it on every subsequent visit.  The flavor of that unusual dish is simply amazing.  Also, the coconut ice cream with sticky rice is a perfect end to a spicy Thai meal, and at $4 it isn't too costly, either.\n\nSo, if you want to enjoy the food here, don't go for something you've already had elsewhere.  Ask the waiter for a recommendation (they have ALWAYS given me good advice), get the crispy rice, a glass of Riesling, and finish up with dessert.  Oh, and make a reservation, or you'll be waiting a really long time for a table."

But the mild level of spiciness of Lotus of Siam's soup is a bit much for me especially after the chili sits in the soup for a while. So order at your own risk!\n\nCrispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage is one of the popular dishes mentioned here on Yelp and it deserved the reputation. Like I said, BURSTING with flavors.\n\nThe crispy duck with chu-chee was delicious!  Now I had no idea what chu-chee is, but the crispy duck came out in a red curry. Both the duck and the curry was very good. My only complaint is the price tag of $20 for a few pieces of duck and not very much sauce. It was good though!\n\nIf you took a cab to Lotus of Siam, be sure to ask the cab driver for a card/phone # and call for a cab to pick you up when you get the check. It does take some time for cabs to get to this location so if you call when you get the check, you shouldn't have to wait much longer after you're done settling the bill."

I can't decide if this added to or detracted from the ambiance but it's nice to see this chef and cuisine gettings it's rightful due notoriety.\n\nThe food at Lotus of Siam is the star and I was by most accounts dazzled. The menu itself is dizzying large with so many different dishes that's it's overwhelming so if you're unsure of what to order then rely on your server to help navigate this menu as they will happily make recommendations that are on point. All dishes are prepared at your requested spice level from 1-10 so be specific. My wife choose a mild level #2 while I opted for a Spicy level #7. This also worked well when moving back and forth between dishes from mild to spicy and back again.\n\nOur Food:\n\nAppetizers:\n\nChicken Satay (Spice level #2) - Simple but beautifully balanced with a sweet peanut sauce and a cool crisp pickled cucumber salad.\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice w/ minced, sour sausage, peanuts, ginger, green onions, fresh chilies & lime juice & ) (Spice level # 7) - The crispy & crunchy texture is wonderful but this dish definitely takes a little getting used to. My first reaction was \"This is really dry\", but when combined with the sliced cucumber and fresh cabbage garnishes it was balanced and addictive.\n\nEntrees: (served w/ steamed white rice)\n\nCharbroiled Prawns w/ Spicy & Tamarind Sauce (Spice level # 2) - This was a simple, perfect shellfish presentation with butterflied prawns still in their shells, simply charbroiled and served with two contrasting sauces of spicy vs. sweet & sour.\n\nThum-Ka-Noon (Pounded Young Jackfruit Shredded)\n(Spice level # 7) - This Northern Thai dish was hands down my favorite of the night by far. Shredded jackfruit, ground, sour pork & spicy tomato sauce & herbs. This was so focused and satisfying. Wow!\n\nKoi Soy (Issan Beef Tartare) (Spice level # 7) - I wanted to love this dish but I really was disappointed. The cubed, raw beef was fresh and clearly of good quality with a nice texture provided by the rice powder but I was so overwhelmed with the flavor of lime juice that I couldn't even decipher the actual primary taste of Beef Tartare.\n\nDessert:\n\nFresh Mango w/ Sticky Rice & Coconut Ice Cream - \nThe mango & sticky rice themselves were awesome. I love the savoriness of this dessert combination however I was not so much a fan of the coconut ice cream as I found the texture icy and the flavor lacking any distinct natural coconut profile. I asked our server if it was made in-house and he stated they bring it in from California. It did provide some welcome temperature contrast to the cool, tart mango and the sweet, warm sticky rice but otherwise it was completely forgettable. \n\nIt's worth drawing attention to the exemplary service here as it truly is by any measure fantastic. The front of the house staff were very welcoming, attentive and provided many good menu suggestions. Our water & drink glasses were never even half empty and plates arrived and were cleared at perfect intervals.\n\nI'd love to return again and try many more dishes along with the hope of finding more magnificent Thai treasures. If your truly love Thai food then you must try Lotus of Siam atleast once if not ten times. \nIt really deserves your attention."

But inside was a pleasant surprise. It's huge. And had a bar area for you to grab a few drinks before dinner.\n\nWe arrived at 5:20 pm,10 minutes before they opened and there was already a line of 40 people waiting on be seated. Luckily they had enough tables for us to be seated.\n\nFood was amazing. For a party of 2, we ordered the garlic prawns and the crispy duck in panang curry. I highly recommend both. \n\nService was attentive and friendly.\n\nOverall, a great place to enjoy great thai food. Will definitely be coming back."

            "review": "We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.\n\nOn a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalape\u00f1o will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! \n\nApps..\n\n#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalape\u00f1o and sticky rice. \n\n#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. \n\n#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.\n\nSalads..\n\n#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. \n\n#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.\n\nEntrees..\n\nA. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. \n\nK. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. \n\nDrunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. \n\nGarlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. \n\nDessert.. \n\nWe're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).\n\nAt some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. \n\nBon appetite!"

Banana/rice/coconut ice cream dessert was the perfect coda to a great dining experience. Servers were very helpful and efficient. The Thai beer (Singha) accompanied the food well enough to make me order a second (otherwise the brew options were dismal). Decor is nothing to write home about, but cozy. Go!"

I just had to try what the heck this man was talking about! My husband says Lotus of Siam is legendary in town. Well, I hadn't heard of it until Ming Tsai. \n\nLocated in the not so flattering neighborhood of Las Vegas, I was surprised at how many patrons were there at 2pm! We were doing late lunch and was hoping to scarf as much by closing time at 2:30. I was intrigued to find that people were still filing in at this time.  \n\nThe waiting area is compact and uncomfortable.  We waited about ten minutes until our party was called. We found the restaurant busy and bustling when we were finally seated.  The restaurant has space in contrast to the narrow entrance and waiting area.  I was pleasantly surprised to see an entire wall of wine in what seemed to be a temperature controlled cellar.  There was a lunch buffet which we did not care for at that time.\n\nOur server was nice and friendly and guessed correctly at my reason for ordering Nam Prik Ong.  Needless to say, I had the Nam Prik Ong while my buddy ordered Khao Soi (egg noodles in curry coconut sauce with bits of chicken). \n\nVerdict: Ming Tsai must have not had a lot of opportunity to eat in town.  Nam Prik Ong was good, but I wouldn't call it the best thing I've ever eaten in Las Vegas! I have to admit it is unique and I will probably not see this dish on the menu of any other Thai restaurant.  The Khao Soi was good too.  Based on the two orders we had, did I have a ridiculously spectacular dining experience? The answer is, eh. The size of the menu however allows for Thai food education that your favorite Thai delivery place will most likely not provide."

We were going to leave, but a line quickly formed before they opened so we figured we should stay. This is the best Thai food I have eaten in the US. Service was excellent, food came out quickly, and best of all, the food was excellent. They also have a huge wine selection if you drink wine. Ate the Drunken Noodles with soft shell crab, Massaman curry, crab fried rice, Tom Yum soup. The curry was sweeter than I've had before but was quite good. Highly recommended.

Lotus was on the list and after reading all the reviews here on yelp, I was convinced we had to go. So, on our last night in Vegas we headed out to dinner (we made 6pm reservations but ended up getting there early around 5:30). There was no wait at the door like I was expecting. We got our table right away. Soon after we were seated, it was like the flood gates opened and the restaurant was packed. \n\nOrdered:\nAppetizer: fish cakes (don't remember the Thai name). These were really good. They have a slight lemon flavor, they come with cucumber pieces in some kind of sauce that was really good. We really enjoyed this app.\n\nMeals:\nCrispy duck panang: so so so good. I wish it had come with more sauce, but there was enough for all of us to enjoy. The sauce was delicious and the crispy duck was perfect. This was my favorite dish!\n\nGarlic prawns: another delicious dish!  The skins are separated from the actual prawn so you can eat the prawn, then the skin. So tasty and crispy. I actually only ate one though bc I was obsessed with the duck dish.\n\nSpicy sausage (from the Northern menu, forget the Thai name):  the guys I was with wanted this. I didn't like it. They liked it but said they wished it had some kind of sauce with it. \n\nDessert:\nFried bananas: these were awesome. I was picturing just one giant banana coming out but it was 8 pieces individually wrapped in their wonton wrapper with coconut, then drizzled with honey. It was like a crispy banana, sort of tasted like banana bread too. Very good.\n\nI really wish this place was closer to home for me.  It exceeded my expectations. I don't know when I will be back to Vegas, but I will be sure to come here when/if I am back. Was happy to end my trip with this as my last dinner here."

There were some dishes that we liked but others were just eh ... \n\nIt's located in some random strip mall that is pretty remote.  It's really the only place that looked open in the entire huge plaza.  There were some cars parked outside but as soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, I had no idea how big it was and how many people can fit inside this place.  After seeing all the people, I realized that all the cars parked outside were solely there to just eat at this location.  So of course, you start to get really excited. \n\nWe made reservations for 8:30pm on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait at all unlike the walk-ins who had to wait about 45 min to an hour.\n\nWe ordered the following (ranked in order of like/dislike):  \n\nTom Kha Gai Soup - this was by far the best tom kha gai soup that we've had.  They cook it based on a Bangkok style (not sure what that means) but it's freaking good.  We got the medium spicy level which was a bit too spicy for my husband (he usually eats average spicy) but I loved it (I can take red hot spicy) and I actually wished it was a bit more spicier for me.  You can order it by cup, bowl or pot which is nice.  We ordered a bowl for the two of us and it was a little too much.  We still had some leftover that I really wanted to finish but we wanted to save room for the other stuff. \n\nDrunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab - we were a little disappointed with this dish.  It has a lot of potential to be a great dish but when we got our noodles, they were stuck together in massive clumps and it came out mushy.  They didn't separate out the noodles and that part of the dish was just bad.  The flavoring was awesome and the soft shell crab on top was delicious.  I think it had to do with them being in a rush since the place was packed and I can tell they just wanted to serve you and get you out the door as soon as possible.  I would rather go back when it's not as busy and try this dish again to see if the noodles will actually be separated this time because this was a great dish but the noodles just fell flat for us. \n\nDeep Fried Garlic Prawns - this was another okay dish.  The prawns are deep fried so that you can also eat the shell.  The crunchy shells are amazing but we felt like there was something lacking from the flavor of the garlic prawns, almost like it needed a dipping sauce or something else.  We actually took them and dipped them in the drunken noodle sauce which made them taste better. \n\nMassaman Curry with Chicken - I kept reading about all the reviews for the curry so we had to order one to try.  The portion size of this curry was pretty small.  It was a very sweet curry and almost too sweet for my tastes which is odd because I love anything sweet.  The curry itself didn't have as thick of a texture as I'd like.  And there was nothing unique about this curry.  It tastes like curry that you can get from any other Thai place.  \n\nOverall, we were slightly disappointed with the meal and we thought everything was okay not the greatest like everyone else points out in their reviews.  I would only go back if I had a reservation because I don't think it's worth the wait.  And I would only back to try this place out on an off hour when it's not so busy just so I can compare the drunken noodles."

I've only had Thai in about 4 places, so I'm not educated enough to say it's the best anywhere, but it is certainly the best I've ever had. \n\nPlace is in a real hole. I mean, I'd NEVER drive into this outdoor mall area on a whim. But don't judge it from the outside. Interior is perfectly fine and clean. Recent expansion helps a lot. I was here in 2008 and found it to be wildly good, but cramped and hot. Not a problem anymore. \n\nMenu is diverse and complete. I like the \"jerky\" appetizer a lot, then moved on to the Tom Kha Kai soup, spicy thai salad, noodles, curries, and more basil noodles. Nothing was short of very good. Some of it excellent. Thai beers perfectly neutralize the flamthrower heat put off by those evil little green thai chiles. Easily the hottest damn thing I've ever bitten into thinking it was part of a green bean or something. I was sweating like Mac in the movie Predator talking about the \"same moon, different jungle\" while dry shaving his cheek. \n\nMy single criticism is menu descriptions like \"Plar Dook O-Cha\" do nothing for this English only American. Waiters have thick accents and do not seem to follow requests of \"what is this?\" when pointing at the menu. But, that's really my problem being so ignorant. Whatever it is, it's probably good or great anyway. \n\nCan't go wrong here. Good for groups or couples. Reasonably kid friendly too. \n\nHighly recommended."

I told my server about my peanut allergy and told him to pick me out an appetizer and an entr\u00e9e that would represent the best the restaurant had to offer. To start, I had prawns that were wrapped in bacon, fried (in what tasted almost like egg roll batter), and served with sweet and sour sauce. Meaty and full of flavor, I would definitely order them again. For my main course, I had the drunken noodles with sea bass--and oh my gawd, that stuff was incredible. The fish was lightly fried and crispy on the edges, but velvety smooth on the inside. The noodles were tender and intensely flavorful, especially when paired with the peppers and basil leaves that accompanied them. I asked for the dish medium spicy, and it was the perfect amount of heat--it challenged my palate, but it didn't obscure the wonderful flavor of the delicate fish. After all of that food and two Singha beers (I had forgotten how good they were), I was as full as I've been in a while. But any stomach stretching was 110% worth it, as Lotus of Siam was the highlight of my Las Vegas dining."

That should factor into how much weight you put on this review.\n\nLOS is located in a rundown business park; but it's an anomaly among its neighbors.  And that's clear from the moment you walk in.  People often complain about the waitimes (just read a few other reviews on here), but that's just a byproduct of LOS's excellence.  If you want a short line go to Panda Express.\n\nInside, it's Thai fine-dining, yet a casual vibe remains: you can celebrate an anniversary, you could show up in sweatpants (like I did today).  The walls are plastered with pictures of the owner and various celebrities, food critics, chefs, and friends.  I'll be up there one day, just watch.  An exquiste wine cellar is the centerpiece of LOS.  And its busy bar is a great place to wait for a table.  Once you're showed to your seat, the waitstaff more than take care of you.  They're pleasant, despite being ultra-busy, you'll never be without a full glass of something, and they're happy to explain or recommend a dish.\n\nWhile the ambiance and service is a highpoint, the food is why this place is great.  I have only had a few dishes, but I don't think their is a bad choice on the menu.  I got Yellow Curry the first twenty or so times I came to LOS.  (That's always been my default dish to gauge a Thai restauraunt.)  It's the best curry I have ever had.  I have also had their Chicken Pad See Ew several times, which is equally tasty.  \n\nThe last ten or so times, however, I have ordered--or, better put, devoured--tehir Chicken Khoa Soi.  I get it at a 7 out of 10 on their spicy scale.  It's the perfect balance of heat and flavor.  (I'd get a 5 if you can't handle heat, though.)  It's the best Khoa Soi I have ever had, and I'd bet it's the best Khoa Soi in the U.S.  That's how good it is; that's how good LOS is.  \n\nWhether you're flying into Vegas for the first time, or you come to Vegas often, or you live here, this should always be in your trip itinerary.  LOS, by a good margin, is the best restauraunt--top to bottom--I have ever eaten at."

The crispy duck with drunken noodles was as another reviewer mentioned \"life-changing\". The flavor profiles that were going on throughout the course of the dish were AMAZING! The skin on the duck was just as good if not a notch better than The Peking Duck in Chinatown, NYC. (That's saying ALOT!)\n\nWe split a number of appetizers including the fried wontons, the spring rolls, and my favorite the prawns. A definite must try.\n\nNot overly pricey at all and well worth a little jaunt to a less than desirable part of Las Vegas, but hey that's what gives this place it's edge."

It will definitely be my go to place to eat whenever I am in Sin City.  That is quite a recommendation, considering I am part Thai, my father was a Thai chef, and I travel all over Thailand frequently eating my way through the country :-)\n\nIt is crazy what you find in a nondescript strip mall off the Strip.  Other diners seemed to be enjoying the lunch buffet...when in Vegas, right?  We did look at the food offered on the buffet and it looked good, but after seeing some of the regional dishes that are not commonly available at most Thai restaurants, we had to bypass that.  \n\nThe tod mun pla (fish cakes, sometimes on the menu at Thai restaurants, but more often no) was very good.  The Khao Soi is not offered at very many places.  I can probably count on my hand how many of the thousands of Thai places I have eaten at had this on their menus.  It was phenomenal!  It was authentic to any of khao soi I have had in Chiang Mai and other parts of Thailand.  It was even served with the same garnishes.  The dish was bursting with flavors.  I was in heaven and would have gone back again for dinner that night if I didn't have other obligations.  My friend had the yellow curry and that was very good as well.  \n\nThe servers were attentive and good about refilling our water and checking to see that we were doing okay.  I complimented the chef and raved about the khao soi being as good as any I have had in Chiang Mai and was informed that the chef was from Chiang Mai, so it was great.  They looked like they had a solid wine list as well.  The other great part of the dining experience was the price.  It was $30 for two people with an appetizer, two entrees, and one Thai iced tea.  After dropping $20 for breakfast for one while stuck in the hotel, this was a wonderful deal :-)"

That's right folks, every bite at Lotus of Siam makes each minute stuck in traffic/wasting gas/ road rage worth it. While we were about to make our way to the strip for king crab legs at Vegas Style Buffets, a friend persuaded us to eat this \"Best Thai Food in North America\". The thought of eating Asian food in Vegas after coming from a 50% Asian infested area in LA didn't exactly rate high on my desireability meter, but OMG...take one bite of this magical/ what did they put into this/ if it's crack I'll still eat it- concoction changed my mind. \n\nThe outside of this place makes it look like a hole in the wall. Definitely not the glitz and glamour that you're looking for, but enter and the walls are lined with awards and thai-style decor.\n\nWe were overwhelmed by all the food and spent about twenty minutes badgering the waiter about what was good. \n\nLaos Papaya Salad- Not to be eaten if you don't like spicy food. I love spicy food. The more it burns, the better it tastes, even though I probably won't be able to taste afterward. Point in case? It was good. But if you can't handle really spicy, it probably isn't for you. Or ask them to make it a level 2 spicy (medium). \n\nGarlic Prawns- I love garlic. I love prawns. I love Lotus of Siam. Therefore, I love Lotus of Siam's Garlic Prawns. They don't skimp out on the prawns, the flavor is explosive. I believe it's fried, so it's crispy on the outside, probably not the best thing for your waistline, but wonderfulness in a bite is not good for your waistline. \n\nAnd finally...\n\nDRUNKEN NOODLE!!! \nI don't know why they call it drunken noodle, maybe it's hangover food? Maybe there's alcohol in it? Maybe you're supposed to be drunk while you eat it? I don't care...sober, drunk, about to die, I love this stuff. It looks like your typical Pan-Fried noodle, but looks are not to be deceiving of this mouth-watering concoction. It's extremely tasty, balanced, and a sensible portion, although with the 6 of us it was a fight for every last bit of noodle on that plate. I am now on the quest to try every Drunken Noodle in the LA area, but have yet to find anything remotely close. \n\nOh Lotus of Siam, why must you be so far? That's right people, at 25 years old, the idea of partying and getting drunk on the strip are lower on the list of priorities. Number one? Eat Lotus of Siam."

As for foods we ordered-- garlic chicken wings, shrimp & chicken pad Thai, That beef salad, and duck drunken noodles. All pretty tasty. I'm usually used to having Thai food that is burning my tongue, so the lack of spiciness in the foods really surprised me. But I can not complain. The food was beyond delicious. The Pad Thai is one of the best I ever had. I love when my noodles come out cooked just right & not mushy and stuck together. \n\nThe service was pretty slow but the place was extremely packed.

We ordered seven items and asked the server to space them out.  \n\nFirst was the tom yum kai soup at medium spiciness.  The soup was good, had a fair amount of chicken, but was missing in straw mushrooms.  Before we had much time to enjoy the soup, two more dishes were brought out.  So much for spacing.\n\nThe first was nam kao tod which the menu describes as crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice.  The crispy rice were very present but cubed pork was almost flavorless.  The dish was really lacking.  Along with this, we were served the nam prik ong, spicy red chili dip served with vegetables and some fried pork rind.  The chili was flavorful and I found putting it on the rinds was the best way to eat it.  Crunchy texture and heat.\n\nWe were then brought the khao soi with beef and the thum ka noon with chicken.  Both dishes were OK.  The winning dish was the khao soi.  Very flavorful with outstanding noodles.  This was one of two dishes that were very good.  I thought the thum ka noon was watery and didn't have a lot of flavor.  \n\nThe one dish which was the other star of our meal was forgotten.  We had to have our server come back to the table and remind him that we had ordered the garlic prawns.  We were brought our order.  The prawns were good and the crispy outer shells very delightful.\n\nI had a diet Coke which was refilled several times without asking.  Service was good but I wish they had spaced the dishes out more so we had a little more time with each dish.  \n\nThis was my second time at Lotus of Siam.  I think I'd be back only if I wanted to try something different in Thai food.  It was disappointing."

I came recently and I must say, I'm LOVING the remodeling. It's so bright and spacious now. But don't let the extra space fool you because you will still need a reservation to escape the extremely long wait. \n\n1st place winner: Garlic Prawns: I'm not sure exactly what it's called, but this place is famous for it apparently. What they do is that they have these prawns dipped in a light, garlic tempura sauce and then deep fried. Okay, one: it's deep fried, and two it's garlic with prawns. What could possibly go wrong? It's SUPER delicious! Like the shells from the prawns cracks off the meat and becomes super crispy. I personally think the crispy skins are the best part of it because it just has this awesome crunch and then you have this huge explosion of flavor in your mouth... (I just realized how wrong that last part sounds... oh well!) \n2nd Place: the Shrimp Pad Thai: I was really surprised about the execution of the Pad thai. Unlike most Thai restaurants, they use a thinner and skinnier noodle which actually absorbs the peanut sauce a lot better because of the greater surface area AND it's chewey which deserves my love and affection.\n3rd Place: all other food items. I can't really go into depth on what else you should order here because I'm already drooling enough as is after explaining the prawns.... hehe\n\nThe price is right and it won't leave your wallet crippled, which is excellent because everything else in Vegas is supperrrr expensive!

The prawns were gigantic and cooked with such a nice crunch to them. The noodles that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment, even with your white rice! I also loved loved loved the duck. Great crunch on the skin and the curry had a reasonable kick to it- loaded with flavor. Both of these dishes I would no doubt get again. The beef dish- while the beef was cooked nicely was not a favorite of mine. It was doused in something that resembled BBQ sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of (and notice how I said doused, they probably put too much on the meat).\n\nAll in all, it was a delicious meal.

Thai beef salad, short ribs served with egg noodle and curry sauce, soft crab drunken noodle and steak tartar. Ask your friendly wait staff for their favorites you will not be disappointed.  Our very special find was a raw shrimp with a small slice of garlic, tamarind paste, a lime oil spice sauce and all wrapped in a mint leaf."

The Thai tea didn't taste like it was from powder, but instead had a flavor that stayed on your tongue even after you drank it. The Pad Thai had just the right amount of sweetness to flavor combo to make it addicting to eat. The duck curry had pieces of duck that had more meat than fat, but just enough fat to give it that great taste. Everything we ate was great!\n\nSo, I'll review things I don't really notice. I was hesitant because the plaza where Lotus of Siam is located is pretty ghetto. I thought it would be dirty or run down. Wow was I wrong. Upon entry, you see all the awards that place received, including the James Beard award. Host was welcoming. Drink orders were placed right away (get the Thai tea). And most importantly, THE PLACE WAS SO CLEAN! Our table didn't feel sticky or wet. I saw a server wipe down our table but then dried it off too, which many restaurants don't do and just leave it wet (I hate that). The utensils were shiny clean, not even any dry water marks on them. Same with plates. Floors weren't sticky or stained. Walls were clean. Bathroom was exceptionally clean. All this just added to how great the food tasted. \n\nDEFINITELY eat at Lotus of Siam. Don't be fooled by outside appearances, as beauty is found within. And yes, food beauty is definitely found in Lotus of Siam."

In no particular order, here's what we ordered (I apologize in advance for not having the proper names of things, but I just can't remember):\n\ndrunken noodles with fish (entree) - YUM.  The noodles were a bit greasy, but the fish was perfectly fried - lightly crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside.  The flavors were also incredible, lots of basil goodness, for those who love that.\n\nraw shrimp (appetizer) - yes, the shrimp was raw, but if you can get past that, this dish is definitely worth trying.  it comes with this really tasty dipping sauce that's spicy, but not in the ah ah flaming hot way, but the savory rich way.  You like spicy?  You like sour?  Try this dish!\n\nraw steak tartare (appetizer) - the flavors in here were amazing.  the closest I can come to describing it is that it's a bit like the cold chinese beef five spice dish, with more thai flavors mixed in.  I know that that description is pretty much no description at all, but if you like spicy and you like meat, you should definitely give this a try.\n\nscallops with mint chili sauce - oh god so good.  the scallops were cooked to perfection, and that sauce...well, I could drink it as soup with a side of rice.  It's not overwhelmingly minty, and also has a nice kick of cilantro to it.\n\ntom yum soup - really really sour, with a hint of spice - we got the \"for two\" bowl (medium size), and shared with four people, which was really the perfect amount for an appetizer.  There were lots of big juicy prawns inside, and also some mushrooms and chili oil.\n\nbeef salad - our waiter recommended this to us, as one of the most popular dishes, and I can certainly see why.  This was probably my favorite (though ironically, I can't remember the thai name for it).  The beef was really tender (I think they marinated it or something beforehand), and it was served over a bed of lettuce with onions, lime juice, and a hint of ginger.  The dish was pretty saucy, though, so you'll definitely need some rice to eat with it.\n\nThis place is pretty pricey, especially anything with seafood in it, so be prepared to spend some dough.  My experience with Thai food up until this place was pretty much pad thai and basil chicken, so this place really opened up my eyes to just how incredible Thai food can be.  And if you're like me, and don't really like the coconut-y, peanut-y side of Thai food, rest assured that this place has plenty of other spicy/sour items for you to try if that's what floats your boat.  The menu is absolutely humongous, and if you go with a group, everyone should be able to find at least one item they'd like to eat."

Our party of four showed up on a Tuesday afternoon, seeking a change of pace. We ordered mostly from their northern-style Thai menu. \n\nTheir Green chili dip was barely a tingle on my tongue, and I was expecting more of a bite and heat, when they warned us that it was spicy...\n\nTheir curry noodles was decent, as was their penang curry; but completely and utterly toothless in terms of spice.  And I'm not what you would call a hot head either. \n\nSkip the Tom Yum, since the base seems to be a chicken broth and not a true fish base and was missing the needed lemongrass in it... (was it because it was lunch and it was on the buffet?) \n\nThe buffet looked ok, but how come it looked more like Chinese food and not Thai food? \n\nTheir Thai iced tea was quite excellent, but their iced coffee was a tad too sweet.\n\nI know this place gets rave reviews, but honestly, I don't think this is the best place to have Thai food, if you're seeking something with a bit of bite to it. I agree that the wine list is extensive, but definitely not a front-runner in my books for Best Thai of the year."

Thai Iced Coffee - Oh My Heaven, I would've chugged this all day if I could have!\n\n2. Garlic Prawns - yum! I'm don't always love fried shrimp, but these are perfectly golden fried (not greasy), are tender, and have a subtle seasoning\n\n3. Chu Chee Shrimp - Oh my goodness NOM! This was similar to a Red Curry but was super fresh and light tasting. \n\n4. Kao Soi - I'm not in to soupy noodles, but my friend ordered this. His mom was raised in Thailand and he has had the dish at home and in Thailand many times. He thoroughly enjoyed it!\n\n5. Thai Iced Tea - this was fine, though I would've preferred a stronger tea flavor (it was a little bland due to too much milk)\n\n6. Mango Sticky Rice - I suppose it's hard for this dish to ever really blow anyone away. It was good, and the seasoning on the sticky rice was a nice contrast to the sweet mango\n\nTip: make a reservation for dinner to avoid a 2+ hour wait.

Then nothing...for over an hour, fortunately our little group only gets to meet a couple of times a year, so we had plenty to talk about, but still, watching tables have their food delivered after they had been seated way after us is slightly annoying to say the least. The service itself was well remote to say the least, yes I know this place is busy no matter what, yes I know they will stay busy with the TV shows promoting them, but I really don't care, if the service stays like this then Lotus goes on my no dine list...\n\nIf not for the service Lotus would have gotten a 4 star rating from me, as ever food is an extremely personal thing, what one person may love another will hate, I have no issues recomennding Lotus, but there are better out there."

            "review": "This was on my list of must-try places in Las Vegas. I think it was a bit over-hyped. Or maybe I just didn't order properly. I've had some amazing Thai food and can't say this was better than anything I've had in the past. Some of the Northern style dishes I can't compare but I don't think they were spectacular based on their own merit. But the celebrity endorsements and accolades on the wall can't be wrong can they? \n\nLet me just start by saying that this restaurant is in a totally sketchy neighborhood. There's even a sign in the restaurant that says that you shouldn't leave your luggage in the car. They have luggage storage in the restaurant so you can bring your stuff in with you. The whole strip mall looks like a bombed out war zone and I'll bet it's pretty scary when it's dark. Like zombies-come-out-and-attack scary. \n\nIt's a nice surprise when you enter the restaurant and see it bustling with, not zombies, but living humans - totally the opposite of the ghost town outside. There does seem to be the illusion that it's busier than it actually is (at least when we walked in). We requested a table for 4. They told us 45 minute wait. We said we'd come back, then they chased us down the parking lot and said 30 minutes, then as we were walking away again, they said they had a table available. When we got in, there seemed to be quite a few open tables. \n\nAs for the food we did as advised and mostly ordered from the Northern dishes at the back of the menu.  \n\nThe Spicy Chicken Wings (regular menu) were delicious. My son said they were the best chicken wings he'd ever had. They were crispy and came in just enough chili sauce so the chicken didn't get soggy.\n\nThe Seafood Soup (regular menu) was okay. It was pretty spicy. The bowl came with one scallop, two mussels, a prawn and some squid. It was okay but not the best Thai Seafood soup I've had. \n\nThe Red Chili Dip (ground pork in chili sauce) served with fried pork rinds and veggies was pretty bland. It needed salt or something. Everyone basically ignored it after one taste. \n\nThe Garlic Prawns were FABULOUS. Crispy prawns, battered, fried with heads, shells, tails and all. Honestly, the best part were the fried shells - they were like potato chips. My hubby thought they could've used a sweet and sour dip and I agree that might have been nice, but I liked them just fine the way they were. \n\nThe Crispy Duck with Mint Leaves were served on top of noodles in a sauce and topped with some herbs and peppers. Personally, I don't think crispy duck should be served with anything wet (like sauce) because it makes the crispiness go away. I've had some amazing crispy duck and this duck didn't really do anything for me (or my hubby who LOVES crispy duck). \n\nFried Bananas with Coconut Ice Cream for dessert was good. Nothing special. They didn't have the sticky rice with mango available. The bananas were wrapped in wonton wrappers then fried. Nothing wrong with that, but I can also make this at home. \n\nAll of this and a couple glasses of wine came out to about $132 before tip. The prawns and the duck were both over $20 bucks. Otherwise, everything else was around $8-15. \n\nAll in all, spicy chicken wings and garlic prawns were good. Everything else: MEH. I might go back and check out the front of menu next time. There are some pretty fine Thai restaurants in the Silicon Valley/Bay Area that I think are MUCH better."

The fried duck in red curry was amazing and I usually don't like the coconut taste in curry but this was perfectly made with just a hint of coconut.

I will mention two things we ordered .....The crispy rice appetizer, Nam Kao Tod is amazeballs! This is not a typical fried rice that you find in any Asian restaurant, this is actually deep fried rice with a spicy, tangy and utterly delicious texture and flavor. I've never had anything like it. We also ordered (amongst a bunch of other superb dishes) the Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass. The fish was melt in your mouth, the flavors.....drool! This food paired with some sick German Rieslings made for the best 30th birthday dinner a girl could ask for. Way better than paying out the nose for a uppity dinner at a famous chef's restaurant on the strip. If your in Vegas and appreciate ethnic food, don't miss this place!"

We literally got a table when they open at 5:30pm. Service was amazingly quick and attentive. The food arrived within 5 to 10minutes. The price is on the higher end for Thai food- average about $15 to $30 for entree, but it's well worth it. The menu is very extensive and it's sorted by the region of Thailand.  \n\nThe garlic prawn comes with 8 generous pieces and flash fried with garlic seasoning. It was delicious and the shrimp was crispy. The prawn was deshelled therefore consumption is very convenient. \n\nThe crispy duck with the noodle was one of my favorite. The duck was tasty with a crispy skin. The flat rice noodle was slightly pan fried and complimented the duck really well. Pretty much, it's  similar to the Chinese chow fun (pan fried rice noodle) atop with crispy duck. \n\nThe Thum ka noon was minced pork with jackfruit. We randomly ordered this and it was interesting. It would be really good if it's eaten with rice. Overall, the food was very well seasoned and I cant stop burping after the dinner. I will definitely come back and try different entree. I'm curious how good a simple pad thai or pad see ew would taste in here?"

The take-home message: the food is great and there's nothing to complain about, but there's room for improvement here and there in the dishes.\n\nI went with a group, and we shared several dishes. The Pad Thai was very good--fresh, complex, and a good mixture of flavors, though I thought it could have had more depth of flavor--more contrast between sweet and salty, tart and spicy. Our Tom Kah Kai was fabulous--piping hot, spicy, rich and complex. The green papaya salad was fresh and tart, though not quite as flavorful as I would have liked. My Panang curry with chicken was delicious, but extremely spicy even when ordered medium. The service was very good, the beer was cold, and it wasn't too hard finding cabs to take us back to our hotel. Best of all: Lotus of Siam isn't on the Strip!\n\nI'll definitely go back if fate ever forces me to return to Las Vegas.\n\nA note about how I rate: It seems to me that people mean very different things by the stars they give in a review. Here's what I mean: 5 stars means that a place is exceptional in some way, special even among very good peers; 4 stars means that the place is very good in every relevant category but not outstanding or exceptional; 3 stars means adequate--a place I would go to again but not great; 2 stars means unacceptable--a place I would not go again because it is seriously deficient in some way; 1 star is horrible, that the place  was not only unacceptable in some way but that it was exceptionally, unforgivably bad. In every case my rating is comparing the place reviewed to similar places-- thus an outstanding diner gets a 5 even though on an absolute scale its food might not be as good as that at a gourmet restaurant."

I was determined not to order regular dishes but was with some diners that aren't that adventurous, so no raw meat, liver or too spicy!\n\nWe ordered Tod Mun Plar, Garlic/Pepper Chicken Wings and Pad Thai. All were very good, fresh and more than enough to share for 4 but only three of us. Also, luckily we ordered  these typical dishes because it was all the non spicy eater in our group could eat, although the fish cakes had a little kick.\n\nWe ordered the Squid garlic, sauce was amazing, even just with rice! The waiter suggested the Braised Short Rib with Panang and Thai Basil Catfish. Here is where we tread the spicy fantastic. We specifically ordered mild and their mild is a regular joe's spicy!

I cannot go more than a couple of days without getting Thai.  Any longer than that and symptoms such as sleeplessness, lack in work diligence, and even unnecessary irritation will begin.\n\nLotus of Siam is the Holy Grail for any Thai food addict.  It is the only Thai place outside of the native country and accepts credit cards that claims legions of Thai foodie fans, myself included.  I don't know if the legends are true about the former chef who cooked for Thai royalty.  Legends in this town often spread like wild fire, without true origins.  But Lotus of Siam is not a lie, because the food does not lie.\n\nIf you are a undiscriminating Thai food-eater, I don't recommend this place, especially if you've heard too much of its reputation.  Lotus of Siam's pad thai or curries do not taste that differently from Archi's or Pin Kaow, and you're guaranteed to pay more here.  But if you are missing those Bangkok street vendors and want a taste of Thailand in North America, this is where you go.\n\nHere are some adventurous (but not risky) authentic Thai dishes to try at Lotus:\n\n1.  Yum Tale (combination seafood salad): the seafood tastes as if Vegas was a beach town; for the price, I venture to say they don't fly in the seafood daily.  But the marinade and dressing highlight the best in what they have.\n\n2.  Plar Dook O Cha (whole deep-fried cat fish): a traditional Thai classic that is a must-try here.  Although the whole fish (fins, head, eyes and all) may look foreign at first to non-Thai eaters; the crispy-on-the-outside and buttery-soft-on-the-inside is something catfish filets will never entirely own.  Lotus's lime juice & peanut/cashew topping is as good as it gets.\n\n3.  A Nua Dad Deaw (Beef Jerky Issan Style): deep-fried jerky that is salty and savory, perfect to pair with sticky rice and any of their salad.  Many restaurants outside of Thailand don't offer this, including all other Thai restaurants in Vegas.\n\n4.  Khao Soi Braised Short Rib: Khao Soi is a type of Burmese-influenced Northern Thai egg noodles served in curry sauce and coconut cream.  You can order it with chicken or pork also.  But the short ribs are divine.  A very authentic dish that doesn't taste too foreign.\n\nThere are restaurants that are one-time affairs, restaurants that are seasonal flings, and restaurants that are long-term relationships.  Lotus of Siam is a relationship for me.  And one that I plan to document on Yelp as I write more updates about this favorite."

I mean, there's a reason why the wait is notoriously long - I've heard that it's nearly impossible to score a reservation in advance. All of the food I've sampled has been pretty much on point. \n\nThe Nam Kao Tod is my absolute favorite appetizer. Now either I've been under a rock for most of my life or that my Thai food palate is extremely minuscule, the latter may be a bit of a stretch considering I am Thai by blood (not a surprise though), but this is the first time I've encountered that dish. To me, it's the perfect marriage of unique flavors that Thai cuisine is notorious for. I MUST know how they fry the rice to get it to be so crunchy. It's amazing! Don't even get me started on the pork which has a similar taste to the Vietnamese appetizer called Nem Nuong. The perfect amount of lime is added to this dish which helps make it unforgettable. This is a must-try...unless you don't eat pork then I suggest asking for the pork to be served on the side. Get it - you're welcome.\n\nI'd say that the only dish that I have ever been disappointed with was their pineapple fried rice. Go figure right? I mean, how can you mess up fried rice? Well, I shouldn't say mess up... I guess you can say that I was taken aback by the strong, Indian curry flavor which masked the entire dish. Like I said earlier, I've had my fair share of pineapple fried rice due to my previous experience with working at a Thai restaurant and being Thai so I have a pretty good sense of what to expect. It may be dependent upon individual tastes, but I personally think that the strong curry flavor really throws off the flavoring of the dish. I mean, it was so strong that I couldn't even finish my dish and I didn't even bother eating my leftovers (and I'm the leftovers Queen). Would I order this dish again? No, there are many other dishes to choose from, and if you are going to order this, be prepared for its' strong taste of curry."

            "review": "Lots of hype without much substance. I really wanted to like this place since there were so many glowing reviews but the overall experience was quite underwhelming. I wonder if I just went during a bad night but every dish I ordered lacked soul. Part of it is probably due to the palatable absence of MSG (which is great they left it out) but the flavors were alarmingly lacking in complexity for Thai cuisine. Here are the dishes I ordered and my critiques: \n\nI order curry every time I visit a Thai restaurant and use it as my pH test. A good curry is usually indicative of many more good things to come but a poorly made curry is a bad omen. I ordered the standard Panaeng beef curry and it was among the most subdued Thai curries I've ever tasted. The beef was tough, and the curry couldn't quite decide if it wanted to be salty or sweet. The coconut milk must have dipped its toes into this dish but changed its mind and eloped with the kaffir lime into the hills. \n\nSalads (yams) are also standard Thai fare and I was excited to see they had Yam Pla Duk Grob on the menu. This is usually a salad dish made with small crumbled pieces of fried catfish. I was confused when the server put this dish down on the table because it was just a few large strips of fried catfish on a bed of greens. When I asked if he was sure this is the right dish, he said this is the only yam pla duk they have. A taste test revealed that it lacked personality just like the curry and did not have the complexities of flavors that Thai salads usually have which involve the interplay of sweet, spicy, salty, and sour. \n\nSince many reviewers noted that they had great northern Thai food, I decided to order 2 northern Thai dishes: Nam prik noom (green chili dip with veggies) and Northern Larb (minced meat). The Nam prik noom lacked the roasted flavor of the chilis and tasted like it was made a while back and just stored in the refrigerator. The Northern Larb made me do a double take just like the yam pla duk grob because it wasn't northern larb at all (and the menu clearly indicated that this was not the usual northeast larb). The only evidence that it was northern larb were two roasted chilis and some oil. \n\nI'm really not sure if this was just a bad night or I ordered the worst dishes this restaurant has to offer. If you read this review, at least you will know now which dishes to avoid. It seems like they are going for authenticity while trying to still please American palates and ended up with lackluster dishes. \"Best\" Thai restaurant in America? Absolutely not."

            "review": "Best Thai food in US? I wouldn't know and I'm certainly not a Thai expert.  Best Thai food I've ever had? DEFINITELY (and this includes a short trip to Bangkok, but I was not so adventurous then)!\n\nI've been here twice, and each time I came out FULLY satisfied.  First time I went, I followed other yelper's advice, and asked our waiter for suggestions.  This is not a place you get your pad thai and call it a day, you want to experience their specialties that you can't get anywhere else.  Our waitress was very patient and recommended all winners.  Second time, I brought my parents here and at the end of the meal, my mom said, \"I never understood your fascination with Thai food before, but now I finally do.\"  Yes, it's that good =).\n\nHere are some of my must orders: \n- Tom Ka soup: my friend told me you can tell if a Thai restaurant is good by its soup.  I haven't tried too many Tom Ka's, but this one's sure tasty to me!\n- Crispy duck panang:  MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.  The duck is fried until crispy, and plated on a bed of panang sauce.  In fact, I'm sure any of its crispy duck options will be good.\n- Sea bass with drunken noodles (or any other combo with drunken noodles): if you're a sea bass lover, this dish is for you.  The drunken noodle is somewhat similar to pad kee mao, but better.  We've also had it with prawns, HUGE prawns came out, the meat was so fresh and bouncy, yum yum.\n- Braised short ribs: we had it with some kind of curry.  The ribs were fall of the bone tender, and the flavor was very rich, you can tell it's been stewing for hours.  \n\nAlso, try the Nam Kao Tod if you haven't, it's definitely different.  Some love it, I'm just okay with it.  But I still get it just to introduce it for the others.   \n\nThere're still so many other dishes that I have yet to try.  It's a definite must go every time I go to Vegas now.  Yes, it's a bit of a hassle since it's in the middle of nowhere, but if you love great food, do yourself (and your stomach) a favor and grab a taxi now!  Although, you might not want to go clubbing right after, give yourself 2 hours to digest before the party begins."

I knocked it down two stars because the flavor has been knocked down to fit farang palates and the service is stoic and unfriendly.  I know it's meant to highlight northern Thai cuisine and having lived in northern Thailand for a number of years it's still sadly a facsimile at best of the real thing.  The khao soi i ate in Thailand was far less refined, much more rustic, and much more flavorful.  The asian restaurants I appreciate are the ones that aren't there for farang, but rather there to feed the ethnicity to which the food claims to represent."

I kind of feel bad that I recommended going here for a friend's birthday since they love Thai food lol. \n\nI ended up ordering beef panang and thai iced tea. The panang was not that great because I didn't really taste much of the spices. The only thing that was apparent was the spiciness, but that gets kind of boring after the 5th bite or so. I've been to some hole in the wall Thai places which had better panang than this place. I did get to sample some dishes that my friends ordered and I have to say the pad thai and curry with duck was really good. They kinda skimped out on the curry and duck though! I guess you could order that if you don't have a big appetite. I love thai tea and always get it when dining in, so this experience was no exception. Was kinda bummed that not only was the thai tea ordinary, but it paled in comparison to some other places I've been to. \n\nI'd say this place is worth visiting, but do take your time to read the reviews and see what people recommend on ordering. Also, this place is located in a shady area so don't go alone! I MAY come visit another time, but only if my friends really want to check it out again lol. This is one of the few places I'd say is more based on hype rather than quality of food."

It was some of the blandest Thai food I have ever had. \n\nThe Panag Nua was tough and lacking in flavor. It was a true Panag curry but it just seemed watered down. The meat had been just sliced and tossed in. Normally good Thai places have nice chunks of beef that they let stew in it all day so the sauce permeates it and the meat just falls apart. \n\nThe Yum Yai salad had almost no sauce and what litte sauce it did have lacked in any flavor.\n\nThe Tom Ka Guy soup was watery and heavily lacking in taste. The chicken in it was dry and huge chunks that were just not right for a soup. It also lacked a decent amount of mushrooms.\n\nThe Kow Pat Moo was totally flavorless for a Thai fried rice. It was more like over priced panda express Chinese fast food rice.  This is a huge failure. I mean how hard is it to toss nam plaud and sugar into some rice? \n\nThe Phad Thai was soggy and had more the consistency of spagetti with marinara then a thai fried noodle dish. \n\nThe saving grace was the moo sautee. It was nice and small like you would get on the streets of bangkok. It did taste good but then again that's the staple of Thai places and you would have to go out of your way to screw this one up.\n\nAll this being said my friends liked it BUT none of them have ever tried Thai food before much less GOOD Thai food. I think this must be the case for a lot of the positive reviews here. An other negative reviewer pointed out that there simply no Thai people in there this does tend to be a good indicator as to if a Thai place is good."

I also complained to the manager but she merely said she will \"remind the kitchen to be careful\" with rubber bands. This is a serious hygiene and cleanliness issue. The server tried to remedy the situation by giving us a cup of coconut ice cream (we were a party of 7) but I felt that was a poor way of making up for their mistake. They never apologized. Someone in my family could have choked or swallowed that rubber band. If that could happen to our table, it could have happened to other tables as well. \n\nThe food here was good but the rubber band incident made the experience horrible.

Only one place fitting enough for this meal; Gourmet Magazines number one Thai restaurant in North America. \n\nIt's unpretentious in an unassuming neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving, be prepared for a true culinary adventure.  This isn't your average neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Tamarind paste, not ketchup in the pad Thai.\n\nTip:  The menu is huge.  Expert on Thai food, study it in advance else let the servers guide you.  Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.\n\nThe meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:\n\nIssan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).\n\nSua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).\n\nPlar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with saut\u00e9ed fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).\n\nCharbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).\n\nGarlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).\n\nMassive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.\n\nAnd to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.\n\nAlways a great culinary adventure."

Although I am still looking for that place, I have found that I frequent Lotus of Siam quite a bit, but it seems like only when I have visitors in town. Almost everyone knows about Lotus of Siam since it has been featured on The Best Restaurants of LV and a lot of other food shows. So why not a more stars? i think that there is a lot of hype for this place and I guess I just expected more and better. \n\nIf you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait as there is almost always a crowd here, both locals and out of towners. If you can, make a reservation so you won't wait too long. I've tried a good number of dishes here and they are good, but not spectacular. For some of the dishes, the prices to me are a bit high for Thai food. I've tried the Paid Thai, Pad See Yew, Beef Salad, drunken noodles, the various curries, garlic prawns, and spicy chicken wings. One word of caution - be prepared for the heat - when they ask you how hot you want, dont go overly crazy. I can handle a lot of heat, but their level 5 is hot enough to enjoy. Any hotter and you wouldn't be able to taste the food. \n\nOverall, I would go to Lotus of Siam when I am craving Thai food, but don't think that it's the best as many of the other reviews state. I am still looking for my go-to Thai place in LV and hope that I can find it as I have in SF and LA."

I had the sea bass with papaya, it came with sliced grapes, tomatoes, and roasted peanuts. All i can say is wow - that is some great stuff.  It's  got a nice amount of fish sauce that isn't smelly old like many Thai restaurants and the combination of the salty fish with tomatoes and grapes makes a flavorful-lively color on my palette. Suggest for first timers or anyone already familiar with Thai to skip the basics like curry because if you traveling from out of town I would push that you try something else. There are many wonderful dishes you can see at the entrance the wall of pictures that we're mentioned in the local news to get an idea\n\nIts now become my favorite stop every time I'm in town"

I chose 10 then changed it to a 9.   It was spicy and delicious $35.00 and $44 after tip and tax.  \n\nCo-workers ordered the drunk fried shrimp and drunk chicken and noodles; both looked amazing.      Other orders were the pad thai, chicken satay and chow mein.  Everyone cleared their plates, however the plates did not look out of the ordinary.  \n\nThe food came out at different times.   So, we did not all start or finish at the same time.   The waiter added an 18% tip for the whole table and then took about 30 minutes to collect credit cards and cash on three separate visits. \n\nThis is not an elegant restaurant.  The strip-mall is the perfect scene for the show Cops.   Bad boys, bad boys... what you gonna do when they come for you ...?\n\nOverall my catfish was outstanding; this is the reason for the four stars."

There are James Beard awards hanging on the wall. \n\nThe setting is not pretentious. The food is all together different from what american Thai has become. Its personal to the chef. The locals will tell you that she is from the Southern part of Thailand, so order from the Southern section of the menu. I did. It was unreal.\n\nOnly complaint is that the portion size was a little small. Or that's their way of putting 10-15$ price tags on dishes and making the same as $20-25 places on the strip... either way, I didn't care in the end. I would have ordered more, and I will go back.\n\nI love that its off strip, and that the people who know about it have made the intentional trip to find out what its all about.

At first I wanted to try the buffet, but thought better of trying the authentic Thai that I've always wanted to try.  Besides, the buffet had limited traditional dishes that I could get at Panda Express.\n\nNo, I wanted the real deal.  And I got it.  To start, we had the Beef Satay.  The peanut sauce was awesome, a bit spicy and flavorful.  The cucumber salad was crunchy and fresh.  Then the spicy chicken wings.  Why?  Why can I never make these at home?  The sweet-spicy garlic chile sauce was great and the wing itself was crunchy and hot.  Just like it is supposed to be.  I could have made a meal from that alone.\n\nOn to the entrees:\n\nMEE KROB RAD NA-Crispy egg noodle topped with straw\nmushroom, vegetable and gravy. I had it with chicken and it was so good.  even when I pushed it aside, I was still eating from the bowl.\n\nMOO YANG-Marinated charbroiled pork, served with spicy sauce.  Without the spicy sauce, it was a star.  With the sauce, it rang out with high notes.\n\nThe service was attentive and warm.  I absolutely enjoyed the experience and will return.  Don't let the area deter you from this gem."

I have eaten here twice and both times I didn't see any patrons of Thai heritage.  \n\nNonetheless, the deep fried garlic prawns are reason enough to try this restaurant. And I'll go back for the perfectly deep fried catfish with basil in a heartbeat. I'll admit, the Pad Thai was a bit sweet for my liking, but my 2 year old daughter ate every morsel.   The Papaya salad was also way too spicy for me, but it didn't stop us from eating the entire dish.  \n\nThe service is fantastic. And if you get here before the dinner rush, around 6ish, there should be plenty of open tables. Otherwise, make a reservation in advance or be prepared to wait a long time."

We had to search for right adress because it's on not on the road side.\n\nThe Lotus of Siam is so popular that's reservations only. If you're not there on time (5 minutes prior to your reservation) they give away your table. Outside the're lines. And we know why.\n\nWe're a party of six with one real Thai Lady. Just in the USA for less than six months. Even she liked and approved the meals.\n\nWe had different dishes to share. The dishes that most impressed were the crispy duck, the pineapple rice and the Tom Kah Kai. All together we order two hot pot's of soup, the garlic shrimps and seven main courses. With a few alchoholic consumptions the total bill ran up tot $250 for six people. Not much for such a nice meal. We'll definitly be back."

This food is top notch, better than Komol or any other Thai restaurant I've been to in town. It's an an unassuming, unimpressive, and perhaps uninviting strip mall, but this area's always been home to a mix of dives and delights, don't judge the book by it's cover or the guy hitting you up for money in the parking lot.\n\nOnce inside, you'll see the space is kept up well and has a substantial wine collection. I can't comment on that since I've always thrown all my money into food and sometimes a thai tea. Their signature cuisine is northern Thai, and while I don't have other cuisine from that region to compare it to, it is delicious. That said, so are the more traditional dishes. The orange chicken, which was good during the lunch buffet, is outstanding when made to order. The pineapple fried rice has a great depth of flavor and is well-seasoned. Anything with crispy duck is excellent. The last time we had a northern Thai shrimp curry that was top notch. If you're not picky, just give the server some general parameters and they'll take care of it for you. You want a curry, pineapple rice, and crispy duck dish? Say no more. I haven't had something for dinner yet that I felt was \"meh.\" The only problem, if you can call it that, is that the menu is huge which can make it tough to decide but on the other hand always provides some room to explore. \n\nThis is a Vegas must. Call ahead to find out the wait time and see if you can put your name on the list. Expect a 45 minute wait for take-out. Don't think you can waltz in for dinner, any day of the week, without a 30 minute wait."

This has been my preferred Thai restaurant for the last seven years.  Their best  dishes, in my opinion, are expressed through the Northern Thai selection on the menu.   It is their specialty.   My go to selection consist of the fried garlic prawns, steamed sea bass served over a bed of apples and grapes, in a peanut and fish sauce,  the seared scallops in a garlic sauce, and Tom Yum shrimp.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, just be sure to specify the level of spiciness desired, or you'll tango with a mouth of fire! \n\nThe restaurant itself is old and located in a less than desirable area.  I say it adds to the charm lol.  Make reservations!  Monday through Saturday this place is BUSY!  If you don't make the prior arrangements prepare to wait in line.  The staff is wonderful and very knowledgeable of the menu.  My favorite dishes have come from waitstaff suggestions.   I suggest going between 530 and 630 p.m or anytime after 830 p.m.  This is the less busiest time to dine in Lotus.   Consistency in flavor, texture, and presentation is slightly neglected when the restaurant gets slammed."

The food is great !\n\nThis restaurant also has a vast selection of wine. This is very unusual for a Thai restaurant. Personally, though I love a nice bottle of wine, I don't really think of wine in association with Thai food. But, they do have it, if you want it. Plus, they also have a good selection of beer, Thai Iced Coffee, and other drinks like that. \n\nThis restaurant is located in a strip mall. Though there are several other international restaurants around it, the outside is not inviting. Don't let this scare you off. Once inside the restaurant is very nice. \n\nFinally, this is a very popular restaurant. People pack the place every day and night of the week. It is best to make a reservation or you may be waiting quite a while for a table.\n\nHighly Recommended !!!"

            "review": "Ok so I'm watching Top Chef Masters in Las Vegas, and all the masters are treated to a dinner at Lotus of Siam for a \"lesson\" in authentic Thai cooking.  It's very clear that all these chefs are blown away by every dish at the table, so before the show was even over I was bookmarking Lotus of Siam on yelp for a future trip.  It helped even more, when I booked a Vegas trip with a friend and the first thing out of his mouth was, \"We must eat at Lotus of Siam.\"\n\nMy advice is to explore the menu in advance, there are so many wonderful sounding dishes, that you can be overwhelmed if you wait until you sit down.  So get a game plan in order because there are 167 dishes on the menu.  We heard the Northern Thai dishes are very special here and you don't get them in most Thai restaurants in the US.  First up was the Sai Oua - Northern Sausage.  This was a pork sausage with some kick to it.  I liked pairing it with some of the crunchy veggies on the plate for some contrast and it also mellowed out the spice a bit.  We were going to compare this with an order of the Issan Sausage, but our waiter told us not to bother, since it would be no contest. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#rJOafb9EviIxvHmuRImkTA\n\nNam Prik Ong was featured once on \"The best thing I ever ate\".  So you know I had to try it.  It's a very tasty Northern ground pork based red chili tomato sauce dip and not very spicy, but packed full of flavor.  It's served with all kinds of crunchy veggies to spread on as well as a few pork rinds.  I will most likely order this every time I go back.  Works well as an appetizer and unique to this restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#w0R40SdZ1M2T6vi_nL7ioQ\n\nA yelper friend of mine, Anita L., bragged about the Nua Nam Tok.  Our waiter warned us that this was a cold dish as some people are surprised.  Well it wasn't actually served cold, but slightly warm at room temperature.  The beef is coated in rice powder which gives it an unusual texture.  The flavor of the sauce was very strong and similar to a Nam Sod, heavy on the lime flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#QwdrDHXlRPQY1CXH6XvNQA\n\nWe felt obligated to get a few standard Thai dishes as a place of reference.  Tom Kah  Kai is a soup that most people are very familiar with.  Lotus of Siam's version was very spicy and if you slurp it up the wrong way, it will get your eyes watering.  I love spicy, so no problems with me.  What I liked about this version was that the lemongrass flavor wasn't lost in the coconut milk at all. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#YZAR3oSugi4fd6bammVMzg\n\nMy buddy loves Pad Thai (as most people do).  I'm not that fond of the dish, but I will say I'm glad that I got to try it here.  Perhaps I've had so many bad versions of it, that I'm jaded.  This was by far the best Pad Thai that I've ever had.  I would order it again in a second.  We had it with Chicken. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#9UnnMrrfaKk53Uuv-pPyuQ\n\nLast up was a Green Curry with Beef.  I love green curry and I love it spicy.  I was asked on a scale of 1 to 10.  I went with a 8.  Lke most things in Vegas; it was fun at the time, but I paid dearly for it the next morning.  It was very spicy and whatever they spiced it up with was green, because other places I've seen all kinds of ground up red chili in there, not in this curry.  Glad I had plenty of rice to soak up this delicious sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#tQBHtC3JR05nKHCMFp-PaA  \n\nYes Lotus of Siam, should be on your must do list of Vegas.  I would make reservations, as it gets crowded.  We were seated promptly at our 8:30 reservation time on a Friday night.  Others who didn't think ahead had to wait.  The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside and has most likely expanded a few times, taking over their former next door neighbors.  Taking a large group here would be great as you can sample many dishes, as a true food tourist should."

We had Fried Wontons, Pad Thai, Pad Sw Ew, Yellow Curry, and I'm not sure what it is officially called but they would know if you said the ribs dish. We devoured everything lined in the middle of our table. The ribs dish was my favorite. The meat fell off the bone and was covered in this amazing sauce that was similar to curry. Yellow Curry is also one of my favorite Thai dishes and while Lotus of Siam does it with more kick, it is delicious!\n\nWe all walked out with very big bellies and food comas."

He recommended a northern Thai dish which had a meat-tomato ragu of sorts which one would eat by dipping thick slices of carrots, cucumber and other veggies.  Although I did find the tomato sauce to be really too much like an average pasta sauce, I did kind of like the dish and appreciated trying something new.

The food was amazing having tried 4 different orders. We got the Seafood soup, Issan Sausage, Yellow Currey with Chicken, and Combination Fried Rice. All of that was delicious and the Seafood Soup had a great spice to it that I was not expecting at first. Be careful if you aren't used to spicy foods though as what you may called mild and order mild could possibly be too spicy for you which is what I saw happen to a friend. The waitress was nice enough to get him a drink for free to help get rid of the spiciness.\n\nIf you plan on going make a reservation 2-3 days before to be safe. We had a group of 15 people and tried to make a reservation the day of which was a bad idea, but luckily we put our name down and gave them our phone number and they called us after about an hour to tell us our table was ready.\n\nIf you visit Vegas there is no reason to not go to this place, by far some of the best food I have ever had."

We ended up ordering 4 dishes to share: spicy chicken wings, tom yum koong (shrimp), thai basil beef, and beef pad see ew. The chicken wings were amazing!! They weren't too spicy, more like a sweet chili, and they were served hot and crispy! The tom yum was by far the best tom yum I've ever had. It was spicy and tangy - perfection! The thai basil beef was very light and a solid dish as well. It went well with steamed white rice. The beef pad see ew was also great, just wish there were more greens added in! \n\nThis place operates very efficiently, our food came out no more than 10 minutes after we ordered it and every dish was hot and fresh!

            "review": "If you live in the area and are able to drop in regularly, good for you. But for those of us who get to Vegas a couple times a year, the visit to Lotus of Siam must be meticulously planned.\n\n* Time your attack. If you're in town for a major convention you have to get there VERY early or else make reservations well in advance for a large party, otherwise you will wait 90 minutes or more. (If you want to call ahead, note that when the restaurant is closed, up till 5 pm, they simply don't answer the phone.)\n\n* Be sure your hotel room has microwave and refrigerator. That way you can order with abandon and know you can take the leftovers to enjoy another day.\n\n* When they ask you \"how spicy\" tell them no more than a 5 or 6 or you truly will have your taste buds blown away. I say this as someone who regularly puts Tabasco in many dishes at home.\n\n* Take time to study the enormous menu (grab one while you're waiting for a table}, or just throw yourself on the mercy of your server after telling them you want the northern/Issan dishes. You will note that many of the salad-y dishes have common ingredients of chili and lime and red onion. Don't get more than one or two of these unless you are at a big table sharing because the flavors will be too close together and the chilis will blow you away for the rest of the meal. Likewise, the finely chopped Issan dishes are complex and subtle but they are close enough in flavor that they should be enjoyed on subsequent visits, not on the same night. (Unless, again, you are a large party and can order a few of these to share and sample.)\n\n* If you're there at lunch, resist the temptation to just get the inexpensive buffet. It's totally different stuff.\n\n* Pace yourself and use discipline when tasting among the different dishes. The food arrives when it is ready; the kitchen seems to have no interest in giving you a soup first, then a salad, then a more substantial dish with rice. If you want your meal organized this way, you'll have to do it yourself. \n\nIf I am by myself, here's the strategy I will use for my next several visits as I order my way through the menu.\n\n* Start with a soup. Most of these are Thai standards but the kitchen is so good with different ingredients I would expect them to be great renditions. Anyway, you can't go wrong with the Northern Style Thom Kha Gai (item M on the Northern menu): amazingly light, fresh tasting, spicy and redolent of lemon grass, a perfect food I could gulp by the quart.\n\n* Now a northern/Issan specialty--or two or more, if you're sharing. Have this before the salad because the flavors are subtle. Some favorites are Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice with very finely chopped sausage) and Kang Hung Lay (garlicky northern pork stew, a smallish portion). This last visit I had #61 Hok Mok Plar, catfish \"in a hok mok chili sauce\" which is like a curry, but eggy--strange and wonderful.\n\n* Now a Thai salad, which you've resisted or just nibbled at because of the chili factor. On your first visit, the choice is simple: crispy catfish salad. It's like a good green papaya salad, but with amazing bits of fish. My last visit I had #14 Larb Koong and was very pleased. Catfish again, but finely chopped, marinated and folded into crispy rice.\n\n* At this point you have spent a lot of money and you probably aren't particularly full, so I would pad my menu with a curry served with rice. My last visit I tried Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow (#G on the northern menu, rice vermicelli curry) and was disappointed--oily and not a lot of flavor. Next time I'll try a standard Panang or red or green curry which will also bring my per-item average cost down. \n\n* Dessert? I am generally too sated when I get to this point but if you want dessert the mango with sticky rice is a delightful and popular choice.\n\n\n* Don't be shy about asking the kitchen to pack the uneaten bits to go--they expect this. They get a lot of takeout orders from people who are taking the food on the plane, or get frustrated at a 2 hour wait for a table. And it's your food--you've paid for it!"

The flavors were blatant and the meat texture was done with the right crisp. For $25, there were eight pieces to share. The crispy duck was deboned and casually sitting on top of a pile of juicy and sticky bed of drunken noodles. There is an assortment of green and red peppers in the pile hence making it a very exotic dish. The thum ka noon is ground pork with shredded Jackfruit. It was a very flavorful dish that would be a good complement with rice but we ran out of room for the carbs. \n\nService and food delivis exceptionally good and quick.

I stuck my nose up like, what the heck is my mom trying to get me to eat here. Well let's just say I made a recent call to my mom saying, \"I am so sorry I didn't like Thai food at a younger age, you were right\".

Garlic & black pepper chicken, green beans and beef, basil fried rice, drunken noodles, or yellow curry. Just a few classic personal favs. I have plans on venturing into the Northern Thai portion of their menu. I recently had their wings as an appetizer. I brought back the three leftover wings to co-workers. Three out of three of them asked where those amazing sweet chili wings came from. I will win them over bringing leftovers from this place. \nNow, let's talk about spice! If you have read any of my reviews, you know I like SPICY!! It grinds my gears when I go to eat any place, they claim something is spicy, and it doesn't make me sweat. Don't tease me! I usually get anywhere from a level 6 to 8. In the past, Pan Asian has been the only place I have had to step back, wipe off the sweat, and shake the hand of the chef to thank them. Well, on my first experience here at LOS, I knew, I had found a place on my level. \nI ordered my pepper chicken at a level 7, and let's just say my Thai ice tea did not last over half my meal. From now on, I will stick with a level 5 or 6 here. Well done Lotus of Siam. There is a competitor in the parking lot, and their level 8 did not even make me turn red. (CUE WAMP WAMP MUSIC)\nI will keep you updated as I try more authentic stuff on the menu. However, if your a white girl (or guy), who can handle spice, and loves Thai- GET HERE ASAP! Thank me later!"

We decided to order off of the menu.  \n\nWe tried: \n\nCrispy Duck (5 stars) - By far my favorite dish, the duck was de-boned and fried to a crisp with excellent flavor.\nChicken Satay (4 stars) - I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked.  It's really easy to overcook chicken but this was great.  The peanut dipping sauce and cucumber salad condiments were spot on.\nYellow Curry (3 stars) - Pretty standard curry but the vegetables were undercooked.  I like my curry vegetables to be a little softer.\nPad See Ew with beef (3 stars) - Pretty standard.  The noodles were soft and the Chinese broccoli was good.  \n\nThe service was ok at best.  We did ask for a large table because we were expecting a large party, however, we were stood up.  The waiter expressed that they could split our bill into 4 but that was the max he would do.  After our dishes were brought out, he disappeared until we had to flag him down for our check.  No matter.  The food was good, we were happy.  No reservations for lunch but they take reservations for dinner."

I was looking forward to dining here but managed my expectations (see: not banking on it being a life-changing experience) and was pleased with the quality of the food and fantastic service. So much so that a couple of weeks later when I was apparently dying of the plague, I dragged myself out of bed to go get take out from there because let's get real: tom kha kai is the Southeastern Asian version of chicken noodle soup.\n\nThe tom kha kai here is wonderfully balanced and what I really liked was that the chicken wasn't tough. I've frequently had this soup with unhappy pieces of rubbery chicken floating in it, but at LOS the chicken is cooked perfectly meaning they didn't leave it boiling in the soup forever. There's also a good amount of vegetables which could make you feel less guilty about eating an entire hot pot by yourself (which I would've had it been socially acceptable). Also enjoyed here were the drunken noodles which I'd never had before anywhere. Sauce=amazing. Amount of seafood=criminally abundant. They don't skimp on the seafood in this dish and it's pretty reasonably priced for what you get.\n\nLOS is worth a trek for an authentic Thai food experience. There's nothing fancy or pretentious about the place but don't let the tiny appearance of the restaurant fool you-there are big flavors inside that are prepared and served with more class than most restaurants on the Strip."

            "review": "There are two different kinds of restaurants in this world; those that are all about looks and those that are all about the food. LOS is definitely the second. \nThis world famous restaurant serves a wide variety of dishes out of a small, unassuming storefront within the commercial center shopping block. The interior is a combination of fancy wine bar [glass covered wine racks, marble counters, lacquered wood, etc] and cheesy chinese restaurant. The food itself is the star, so I don't mind.\n\nWe started with a glass of wine each. I had a semi-dry riesling while J had a pinot noir. Both were fabulous and the wine list is epic! My riesling was fruity and crisp without being overbearing. It was a nice counterpoint to the spicy food. J's red wine was very smooth without any acidity\n\nI ordered a cup of the Tom Kha Kai, a sweet and tangy coconut based soup with tender pieces of chicken and lots of veggies and fresh herbs. Most places use substandard chicken for this soup but that was not the case here. The soup was rich and extremely flavorful, easily the best thai soup I've ever had! \n\nWe also had the papaya salad. I ordered it at a spice level of 9-10 and it was definitely spicy! It snuck up on me after a few bites and was quite strong, but the overall flavors were excellently executed. The contrast of pungent, savory, sweet, nutty, herbal and chiles was something I could find addictive. When we were leaving some of the employees seemed impressed, \"Ah, spicy number 10! that was you!\"\n\nNext came the crispy duck with chu-chee sauce and garlic prawns. We originally inquired about the lobster, but they were out for the day and recommended the prawns instead. The crispy duck was tender with a light, crisp crust and a rich curry sauce. This was J's favorite and is a fabulous way to eat duck! The sauce is great over rice. \n\nThe garlic prawns looked like a huge portion but it turned out that half the pile were empty shells. It was a bit deceiving but even the empty shells were pretty good with the seasoning. The prawns themselves were great, juicy and large. I don't think I would order this again if I weren't celebrating but it was very tasty.\n\nI also had a thai iced coffee to go. It was a strong coffee with chicory flavors and a good balance of sweet and creamy to the bitter coffee. The portion was generous, too!\n\nThis is probably some of the best thai food you can find if you don't have a doting thai grandmother to lavish upon you. The meal ended up costing us almost $100, but it was worth it for a once a year celebration. I look forward to returning to try more of their food, like the Issan style tom kha kai, pad thai and sea bass. Their tea also looks really nice, served in a glass teapot that allows you to watch the water infuse. I didn't ask about it this time, but when we return I look forward to seeing what kinds of teas they offer.\n\nDelicious food, well executed flavor combinations, cheap lunch buffet available, fantastic wine list, large menu and fairly quiet during week days. Worth going if you've never been!"

The chicken in the soup was dry from being in the soup too long. Minus one star.\n\nThum kah noon (pounded young jackfruit shredded) - We have never had jackfruit before. So this was a new dish for us. The meat was delicious with the rice. It would have made an awesome sloppy joe filling.\n\nNua Yum Katiem - Hidden spiciness in the cabbage in this dish. Mouth was burning, but we polished off the dish.\n\nSea Bass on Drunken Noodle - Delicious! The sea bass was deep fried and had great flavor.\n\nThe restaurant called a taxi after we finished dinner. A word of warning,  the location is off Strip, so it was impossible to get a taxi. We waited over 45 minutes for a taxi around 9:30pm. Minus one star. There were 3 other parties waiting outside for a taxi after us. We asked the restaurant to call again, and waited but still no taxis came (weekend of EDC). After watching cars cruise by slowly and contemplating hitching a ride with restaurant patrons, we decided to walk to the Stratosphere to catch a taxi back to our hotel and got to saw the real Vegas. Unfortunately/fortunately, it was super windy in Vegas with 30mph winds. This meant walking back in a sandstorm, but the wind kept us reasonably cool and the streets deserted. We were easily able to catch a taxi at the Stratosphere, and saw a long line of idling taxis there. \n\nI will probably go back again, but only if I have a car.

It was some of the most delicious Thai food that I've eaten, on par with what I had at great restaurants in Thailand and at Pok Pok in PDX. We had the crispy duck panang curry and the phad kee mao with fried soft shelled crab - both were excellent and interesting with those proteins. Prices are reasonable, service is good.\n\nWe stopped in for an early dinner, arriving at 5:30 when they opened and there was already a but of a line. By the time we had finished our meal, there was a 40 minute wait for 2-tops. Go early or make reservations!\n\nGreat Thai food!"

The service is friendly, but a bit slow, so plan accordingly. We came for lunch, but I think it would be interesting and fun to have dinner here. For lunch, the front dining room is set up with the buffet. If you're in the larger (seems new remodeled) back dining room, you get a good view of their very impressive wine cellar. \n\nOnly quibble: husband's superb drunken noodles with seafood had fake crab. HUGE pet peeve of mine and what prevents a perfect \"5 star\" for this place. It tastes nothing like real crab and adds nothing to a dish. I do not get this ingredient at all. Doesn't matter, we'll still be back!"

We kept hearing people talk about this place, they must not know what a great Thai food is! \n\nWe met our friends at the bar upon arriving. The restaurant was packed in the waiting area which was very very small. Our friends were waiting at the bar so we joined them. The bartender lady handed the menu and the entire time we were there (a good 20minutes) never turned around and asked for our drink orders. Poor first impression!\n\nWe ordered a bunch of food to share on the table. I am a big seafood person and prior to going in, I checked Yelp for the \"must order\" items. I ordered the garlic prawns that everyone is raving about. It was average, nothing amazing. Honestly, I still prefer and love Pho Kim Long's salt and pepper shrimp! More flavorful and half the price!  \n\nWe paid our bill and was finishing our drinks. The server kept coming back and asking if we needed anything else and we said no. Not long after, the lady bartender who ignored us at the bar came to our table and asked us if it's ok if we leave cause people are waiting for our table. Really??? We work in the service industry here in Vegas for a long time. Never ever have I experienced being asked to leave! This place is over rated, will never come back again! There are a lot of other Thai restaurant that are  way better in taste and service!"

The servers are always friendly enough, but considering that we are usually about to eat our arms off after the wait, we're looking to get just about anything on our table.

Guinness at a Thai place?  OK!  In fact I probably would have ordered another.  Where was that server again?\n\nThe food here is always just ok for me.  This time I went with the Musaman curry.  I asked for it \"spicy, not spicy like people who think they eat spicy, spicy like actually spicy.\"  They made it just perfect.  It was delightfully spicy, but not run around the room spicy.  Yummy.\n\nThis place is relatively inexpensive, but not cheap, especially considering the $20 cab ride from the strip."

We strolled in and they said the wait was going to be about an hour and some change so we bailed out. This time around, I played it safe and made reservations again for a Friday night at 6:30 pm. We were seated within a few minutes upon arrival. At that very moment the restaurant was half full so technically I didn't really need the reservations. As time progressed, the restaurant got crowded quite swiftly.\n\nThere are numerous friendly servers here which is great, plenty of help. You'll always have people walking around, which you can flag down at any time. It did however took some time to get the food out. We would get half our order then there would be a period of silence. Other servers would approach us and think we were waiting for the check when we were actually waiting for the rest of our food.\n\nAs for the food here, the menu is practically endless. You'll find all your typical dishes you would find in any Thai restaurant, there's some pricey specialties aka chef's recommendations at the back of the menu. However, I think there best deal are their authentic and different Thai regional dishes. Growing up eating Thai food practically everyday, I stayed clear from all your everyday Pad Thais and of the sort.\n\nWe started off with the Tom Yum Pla Dook aka Tom Yum catfish soup. I had all my dishes made with three stars (1-10 spiciness star rating) just to keep it safe. Three stars wasn't spicy, a tingling feel but it won't make your toes curl yet. You can always add more chili if you ask for the condiments. Great soup starter and perfect hangover remedy. Tanginess and some spiciness is ideal after a night of boozing.\n\nNam Khoa Tod - appetizer style dish where they fry the rice along with some other herbal type ingredients. Another authentic Thai dish that many restaurant choose not not to carry (don't ask why I don't know). Overall not too shabby, I'd order it again.\n\nMoo Yaang aka marinated grilled pork. It's really hard to mess this one up. The sauce that accompanies this dish could've used some help though. I'm use to a stronger sauce taste and it was a little bland for my taste buds. BTW, sticky rice (extra $2) is great with this dish but I think they give you a bowl of steam rice instead.\n\nNeua Naam Thok, direct translation: beef waterfall. You know how sometimes beef has a distinct taste to it? Well this one had it. I couldn't stomach more than half. Probably the weakest link that I ordered.\n\nThe portions here aren't too big. Four orders for two people may sound like a lot but we were able to eat at least 80% into it. For Las Vegas, this place isn't bad at all and I would like to come back to try some more of their authentic selection. I'm not going to lie, it's not the BEST THAI FOOD ever but it's up to par for Vegas standards and who they're truly trying to cater to. Remember to make that reservation beforehand and play it safe.\n\nDinner for 2: $50ish."

            "review": "Lotus of Siam is a bit off the strip, and sits in a sketchy area. There is nothing special about this place, inside and out. After reading so much about it, and hearing Andrew Zimmern rave about this place, it was on top of my list for my last Vegas trip. It goes to show, all of the top restaurants aren't inside the popular casinos and resorts. Most of them are all commercialized and owned by restaurant groups. Lotus of Siam is one of one. It makes it unique and special, and is a part of Vegas as much as any of the popular resorts.\n\nWe started things off with something exciting and new. The Koong char num plar, raw prawns marinated in seasoned fish sauce was a favorite of ours. With the spicy fish sauce, fresh garlic and roasted chili paste, the dish definitely had flavor. Ironically, I used a bunch of that fish sauce to get rid of the rawness and \"fishy\" flavor. Spiciness met sweetness from the shrimp. The texture of this was spectacular. A bit on the sticky side, the texture took some getting used to. Still a great way to start.\n\nMy personal favorite was the Nam Kao Tod. It was a crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. Texturally different from the raw shrimp, this had a nice crunch, and the crunch played a great role in this dish. The ginger flavor popped and the citrus was key. It was delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe dish of all dishes-the one to get here always Is the Drunken Noodle Prawn. Thick rice noodles are on fried with deep fried prawns. The shell I kept on and the frying process makes the skins edible. The special blend of garlic sauce and Thai basil was perfect. The prawns were cooked perfectly and the crunch of the skin was amazing. This dish is pretty hard to pass up -- a definite must order here.\n\nTo end everything, we ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was a great neutralizer form all that garlic, shrimp, and spices. The coconut flavor was mild and not too overpowering. My favorite was the sticky rice. Everything just had such a delicate flavor and nothing was overbearing.\n\nBack home in Los Angeles, there are a bunch of Ktown style Chinese restaurants that have pretty good food. From spicy seafood noodles to fried pork and beef dishes, they are all delicious, but you won't find any of these in China. The menu hasn't changed ever since the first time I went, and that is the quality of the places. You know what you will get, and its the same no matter when you go. Lotus of Siam is kind of like that. The menu hasn't changed in forever, and the food, though may not be genuine Thai renditions is delicious."

Go to the back of the menu and order Northern Thai specialties.\" \n\n\n\n Thai food, more specifically, delicious, authentic Thai food is almost impossible to find. Being a traveler, I've been seeking something that would be comparable to what I've tasted when I was in Thailand. For me and my friends, we had to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada in order to experience what I believe is to be the best Thai food outside of Thailand...and it's only an hour flight away from LAX. \n\n Saipin Chutima is a James Beard Award recipient offering traditional, authentic Northern Thai recipes that were passed down from generation to generation. It is a step away from the sweet and tangy flavors that so many of us have been exposed to and are familiar with. \n\nA line congregates outside of the restaurant before opening its doors for service. The menu sits like a book, with numerous dishes to choose from. The d\u00e9cor is simple, casual and a little outdated (but who honestly cares when you're here for the food). Photos of famous people who have visited the restaurant line the walls. And the food...well, it's simply superb. \n \nMY FAVORITE DISH. EN TUAN (HOT POT: $13.95): Spicy and sour soup with beef tendon, bean sprouts and beef slices. I seriously dream about this soup day in and day out after I had my first taste. The broth was full of flavor....bold, luxurious with a lot of depth. Hints of garlic can be tasted in the soup that was seasoned well. The tendon was perfectly cooked with the best texture that ever was put forth in soup. I could slurp this forever and never get sick of it! Thank goodness we got a bowl. It was more than enough for a group of four and the fire in the middle definitely kept the soup hot. We asked for a spice level of 5 and could not taste any spiciness unfortunately (maybe we just have a high tolerance).  \n\n \nLARB WITH PORK ($10.95): Ground pork, chopped onion, green chili, and lime juice served with fresh cabbage. The salad was fresh, with a nice balance of acidity and refreshing. Slightly spicy and nicely seasoned. I enjoyed it but the next time I'm there, I wanna try the Northern larb salad.  \n\nDRUNKEN NOODLE SOFT SHELL CRAB ($22.95): Deep fried soft shell crab with homemade fresh chilis and Thai basil served on top of pan fried flat rice noodle. I loved this dish. The crab was extremely crispy and retained its crispiness throughout the remainder of the meal (although it wasn't long since we scarfed everything down pretty quickly). The noodles were nicely cooked and was a bit spicy. They didn't ask our spice level and I assumed they kept it at a 5, which was the perfect spice for a good kick.  \n\n \nCRISPY DUCK WITH PANANG ($24.95): Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognag. This was absolutely delicious. The duck was extremely crispy. The panang curry was rich and spicy. It was slightly sweet, yet savory and full of flavor. This was definitely one of my favorite dishes and a must order.  \n\nTHUM KA NOON- POUNDED AND SHREDDED YOUNG JACK FRUIT ($10.95): This local dish from the north is unique to the northern part of North Thailand. Made of shredded young jack fruit, ground pork, tomatoes, northern Thai spices and seasoning. This was seriously my second favorite dish. I loved everything about it. It was sweet, a little tangy and a bit sour and spicy. The texture was similar to shredded meat. As full as I was, I couldn't stop eating this dish.  \n\n \nMANGO WITH SWEET STICKY RICE- SEASONAL ($8.95): Sweet, delicious, good. The mangoes were ripe and the rice was perfect. Enough said.  \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong when ordering at Lotus of Siam. Chutima managed to bring dishes that you normally wouldn't find at your local Thai restaurant. It's a special place when literally everything you order tasted phenomenal. I had a difficult time deciding my favorite dish amongst the amazing dishes. When you dream about the food and can't get it out of your head, then you know you've found a gem. The next time I visit Lotus of Siam, I need to try the Nam Prik Noom (just sayin'). Word of advice: Book a reservation because lines form before the place even opens."

I WILL give them props for having the *best* and most smooth Thai Iced Tea I've ever had in my life though. Onto their food? The waiter suggested their duck in red curry. The duck meat tasted a bit... expired.. and rotten. It was also rough, and the curry lacked in flavor. We also ordered a green curry with chicken, which wasn't bad, but it didn't amaze me. I've had much better green curry at any reg Thai joint back home in New York. Now... the appetizer that the waiter said we HAD to order was GROSS. It's some crispy rice sort of thing.. and it's sour, and sour, and sour, and also expired tasting. Why is it their most popular item? People in Vegas must be weird then, sorry guys. \n\nOh, the lady behind the bar area was also rude. She had a huge diamond on her finger and wasn't in a uniform, so she might be some kind of owner/manager. To me though, that means you should step it up a level and be even more nice, not be a snotface. Skinny face, medium long black hair, pale, slender asian woman with a big rock -- BEWARE OF HER, she will make your whole meal unpleasant."

It was packed and there was a line by the time we left. \n\nWe ordered the Nam-Prik-Ong, as recommended by Ming Tsai and based on the reviews, as well as the crispy duck over Panang curry. We had the coconut ice cream over sticky rice for dessert. The food was absolutely amazing! \n\nThe Nam-Prik-Ong was the perfect blend of spices - savory with a warm spice. It comes with an assortment of things to dip (cucumber, cabbage, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, fried pork rinds), and you can order a side of sticky rice to go with it. It's a perfect little appetizer. \n\nThe crispy duck over Panang curry was the best crispy duck and Panang curry (separately) I have ever had. The duck is pan fried and has a tasty crisp on the outside and is tender and moist (without tasting fatty) on the inside. It wasn't gamey and tasted better than any chicken I've ever eaten. The curry was deliciously made with just the right amount of creaminess and spiciness. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream wasn't too sweet or overly coconut-y. The sticky rice was warm and \"marinated\" in a coconut milk mixture that gave it the tiniest bit of saltiness that complemented the ice cream beautifully. \n\nWe went for lunch and there was a buffet for $9.99 per person. We decided to eat off of the normal menu because we wanted to experience what all the hype was about. We ended up spending a lot more between the two of us, but it was well worth it. \n\nThe only thing I wish could've been different is the quantity of food. Although we were full at the end of the meal, it was so yummy that we wanted a few bites more. But that's probably just us being gluttonous."

My friends had been talking about it for months on how amazing this place is but as a California resident I never come out as often as I'd like. I finally got to try it the other day, and all I can say is that this place is just RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING!!! \n\nWe had drunk noodles with Chilean Sea Bass, soft crab, crispy duck with panning curry, crab fried rice, garlic prawns, and the garlic beef to share between 6 guys. Normally, I would say Thai dishes specializes in a few things and I would be able to rate between least favorite to most, but I have to say everything was simply delicious. Between 6 guys it wasn't a lot, but just right. It was really something where you could appreciate each dish by itself. Eating it together was just heaven. \n\nI would say it's a little on the pricey side. We shared between 6 guys with each person getting a Thai iced tea or coffee and it came out to $200 or $33 per person. I suppose it could be cheaper if you go a la carte, but if you want to do Thai family style then you order dishes on dishes, but as a once in a while thing when I go to Vegas: WORTH IT! \n\nI can't wait to come out again and bring some of my friends to go visit the place.

But it is overhyped and I don't think is really worth the drive out here unless you really don't have a good Thai place in your hometown.  I can name 3 in the Bay Area I think are just as good and or better, and two in the DC metro area that are up there too (places I used to live so there are more out there obviously).\n\nGot here on a Saturday by 5:30 and there were a lot of people already here.  There was a large party that ordered a ton of food, so it took us about 30 minutes for me to get my cup of Tom Kha Khai.  It's good, but it tasted A LOT like plain ol' Tom Yum Soup with cream in it.  So it wasn't as special as I thought it would be.  Around 6:20, twenty minutes after my soup arrived, my entrees still weren't coming, and I had to catch a show at 7pm so we asked for it to go.  They were pretty quick after I asked for it to go, and extremely nice about it.  \n\nWe got the crispy duck with drunken noodles.  The crispy duck was very very good, but the drunken noodles were just meh.  I liked the chilis and peppers the crispy duck was fried with.  It reminds me of crispy fried pork chops at Chinese restaurants with the chilis, but it had this special brown sauce on it that made it sweet and extra good.  We also got the Khao Soi.  This was my favorite dish, but the portion was too small!\n\nWe also got Pad See Ew which was standard, and Massaman Curry which was good, but I actually felt was below standard.  I definitely didn't like that the potatoes were undercooked, and that there were boiled grape tomatoes in it.  My boyfriend also ordered chicken dumplings which were ALL RIGHT.  They were so tiny and it was $6 for 6 tiny ass little dumplings.  All in All we spent over $90 for thsi meal and thought it was kind of expensive, especially when we thought of our favorite Thai places from our hometown.  I think you can skip it if you've had good Thai food before.  The food on the strip isn't THAT terrible that you need to cab out here."

I have never had a pad thai this good!! There other noodle dishes were soo yummy too! Like their fun! haha \n\nYou could also never go wrong with CHICKEN SA-TAY in the appetizer section, but if you haaad to choose definitely go with the STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS! If you haven't got it already, i'm basically saying this place is DELICIOUS and a must try :) \n\nThis place gets busy. We arrived like a minute before they opened and there was a line outside waiting to get eat some yummy thai restaurant. So get your butt over here, QUICK!!"

Since we didn't make a reservation for our party of 8, the boy and I made a mad dash to the restaurant early to see if we could still get a table. They just opened for dinner (at 5pm), but the restaurant was pretty much filled already. Luckily, they had a large table open at the moment, so they let the two of us sit down first. (Some restaurants won't even seat you unless your whole party is there, so that was pretty nice!)\n\nWe sat there waiting for our friends for 10-15 minutes (which we felt really bad about), but they didn't seem annoyed at all, whew! After flipping through the menu, we ordered ten dishes. \n\n- Stuffed Chicken Wings: sliced chicken wings - crispy, flavorful, and served with sweet and sour sauce\n- Nam Kao Tod: crispy rice - very interesting, you have to try if you've never had crispy rice before!\n- Nam-Prik-Hed: spicy mushroom dip - spicy! but meh, at least the veggies that comes with it was kind of cleansing to the palette\n- Sai Oua: northern style sausage - were alright\n- Garlic Prawns: BOMB DOT COM. THIS IS A NECESSITY!\n- Yellow Curry and Red Curry: very flavorful\n- Drunken Noodle Seafood: pretty delicious!\n- Pad Se-Ew: typical\n- Crispy Duck: cooked perfectly\n\nTheir Thai Iced Tea was pretty refreshing! And because some of the food came out slower, they offered us a free Thai Iced Tea.\n\nWe got two orders of mango sticky rice and one order of fried bananas. Both were delicious! (I've had better sticky rice though..) \n\nThey also have a HUGE selection of wine! So if you're a wine lover, you're in for a treat!\n\nOverall, great atmosphere, great service, and great food (will have good dreams about those garlic prawns tonight). So take your date there or just go have dinner with your friends. It's perfect!"

During the week they have a lunch buffet so I asked the host whether, my first time there, I should order off the menu or get the buffet.  He suggested ordering off the menu.  So I chose my normal red curry with chicken, medium heat.  The curry was good, I thought a bit mild for medium, but then I chomped down on a chunk of jalapeno that I thought was bell pepper that was not listed as an ingredient.  The only thing other than the chicken was some bamboo shoots and some basil and of course a whole jalapeno cut lengthwise. Also ordering off the menu takes a lot longer to get service and food. If I am in the area I may go to try the buffet as there seemed to be many regular customers taking part.  So far though I am very unimpressed, especially given the hype, and there are two other Thai restaurants I would prefer in Vegas."

I dined with 2 other people and we ordered about 6 or 7 different dishes to try everything, consisting of: the Papaya salad, the Mushroom salad, Pad See Ew, Larb, a Fish dish, and a few other small dishes.  All were delicious and none tasted the same, all uniquely flavored and seasoned.  \n\nMy main complaint would be how long the meal lasted.  This may be a Thai cuisine type of complaint, but the food came out so quickly that the meal only lasted about 45 minutes.  When dining out at a nicer place, I like to spend time to savor the meal and conversate.  Lotus of Siam cooks everything to perfection, but very quickly.  Beware if you're looking to spend the night out at Lotus, if so, it will be a very short night.\n\nPro tip: make a reservation.  They are very strict about showing up on time, but we were seated immediately, while we saw at least 4 parties waiting in line behind us.  Overall, a delicious and great meal"

            "review": "A little over a year ago I watched the Top Chef Masters dine at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas and ever since then this hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant has been on my Yelp bookmark list, just waiting for my next trip to Vegas. Lucky me that trip came this year and I knew that Lotus of Siam was the ONE place that was a must-do for me.\n\nLocated in a nondescript strip mall about a $15-$20 cab drive away from the main strip, Lotus of Siam is unassuming from the outside but has been praised as one of the best Thai restaurants in America.  We gave the doorman at the hotel the address and as the cab pulled up all he said was \"Lotus of Siam\"...no address needed. When you pull up you might be questionable but trust me, looks are deceiving!\n\nLotus of Siam is open for lunch and dinner and while we had initially planned a lunch visit, we got distracted and pushed it back to dinner. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for the night so we arrived early right before they opened to secure a seat. If you plan in advance I would definitely make a reservation if you want to eat at a more \"peak\" time, but they do have a bar where you can try a glass from their lengthy wine menu while you wait.\n\nI had done my fair amount of research ahead of time (because I'm a nerd like that) so I knew exactly what I planned on ordering. Lotus of Siam is a bit unique because they offer quite a few Northern Thai dishes, which you don't see on the menus of most Thai restaurants. Our first dish was the very popular Tom Kah Kai soup. Chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime...this was quite possibly one of the best soups I've ever eaten. We chose a spice level of medium for all of our dishes and found it to be perfect for our taste-a good amount of heat but nothing that was searing away our taste buds.\n\nAfter the soup came the Garlic Prawns. This is one of their most popular dishes and it's no wonder why...deep fried prawns with shells that crisp up like potato chips, saut\u00e9ed in a tasty garlic sauce and cooked to perfection.  Delicious!!\n\nNext up...Braised Short Rib with Panang. The short rib wasn't the best I've ever had but the sauce-a red cream curry with cognac-was fantastic and absolutely made the dish. It definitely took some restraint to stop from licking the bowl!\n\nOur last dish before dessert was one of my go-to Thai carry-out choices....good 'ol Pad Thai. But this was no ordinary Pad Thai-this was the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten, and I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai. The flavors, the spice level, the crispy vegetables, and of course the noodles....I wanted this whole dish to myself!\n\nLast but not least was dessert. We were on the brink of stuffed but I couldn't leave without a few sweet bites. This was actually my first time trying sticky rice and I really enjoyed it. The warm rice with the beautiful, fresh, sweet mango was a great combo and  add in a cold bite of the coconut ice cream...the perfect ending to a great meal!\n\nFrom start to finish, from wine to dessert and everything in between, Lotus of Siam lived up to all of my expectations and then some. If you're in Vegas I highly recommend venturing off the strip to give Lotus of Siam a try for yourself, I know this has now made it onto my must-do list for all future trips to LV!"

The service has always been comprehensive when I've been there - waiters are attentive, and help out with other tables when they're not busy.  \n\nThe food is great - think of it as \"upscale\" Thai without inflating the price too much over your neighborhood \"meh\" Thai place.  \n\nFour stars because the location is weird, the ambience could be a little better, and because I can never betray my heart, which says that nothing in Vegas should ever, ever get five stars.

            "review": "We were saddened tonight, when we headed out to take my father out for some Thai cuisine (which he has never eaten before) at our favorite restaurant (Komol) that they had closed for a large dinner party..... :( :( :( So since we were already in the plaza, figured we'd give Lotus a try (we really have been meaning to eat here, but why venture away from great stuff if they are open!) (sorry Lotus, not knocking you down at all here, but hard to venture away from your local spot once you get comfy!)\n\nOk, inside, I will say - it is very brightly lit up with multiple chandeliers all over the ceiling. Decor wise, just about every wall space is filled with some group's photo & the owner of the restaurant somewhere. Not really sure what that is about. I know the owner of the restaurant was featured in a chef competition that had aired recently (can't even remember which one to be honest) on Food Network.\n\nMoving on - crab cake appetizer, steamed mussels, crispy duck with chili mint sauce, crab fried rice, and rad na with beef. Crab cake appetizer - took me by surprise as the texture seemed to be more sponge like compared to the european crab cake version. Very tasty, but like I say - just a bit surprised from the texture. Steamed mussels - oh yeah a big hit! We were taken aback by the size of the mussels as they were quite large, but still very tasty! And oh baby does that sauce have some KICK! Not enough to have the fire department putting it out, but a good 'Woah what was THAT?!!!\" sensation. Crispy duck - yup sure was crispy! Meat was very tender though, and the chili mint that accompanies this dish is very refreshing. You can alter your spice level, and if it was a bit hotter would probably be better, but for the heat sensitive you still have a hint of the heat. Crab fried rice - nothing really fancy about this dish it is as it says fried rice with crab in it! Only thing about this dish to say would be to chunk up the crab meat a little more instead of having long leg chunks mixed in, to get a better ratio of crab to rice chunks. And then there is the rad na noodles with beef. The dish came out wallowing in a pot of brown gravy. And I will admit, I was disappointed at the lack of noodles in the mix. We barely had enough to go on 3 plates for the adults and 1 toddler. Plenty of beef was served up mind you, but would have preferred a bit more noodle. And the gravy, well didn't really stand out to my tongue palate - just ok.\n\nWould I eat here again? Maybe to be honest. Personally I find Komol a bit better in the taste department, but I haven't had all the specialties here at Lotus - so I can't really say. But based on what I have experienced - some dishes are WOW, and others are 'eh'.\n\nService wise - it was busy tonight, and the staff was rushed and you could tell. The front door had a sign up asking customers to expect a 1 hr. wait for their food due to a large group being in the restaurant. We were lucky to get in beforehand, so our service was quick - but you could sense the staff was a little on edge. Our server was friendly and polite enough, but I know they were scrambling to stay on top of the large group. Anyways - that's my word for here. Happy dining!"

I'm a fan of a value proposition, and this is a great one.\n\nMake reservations because otherwise you're going to wait. Forever. Like maybe until the next day. And that's your fault because why would you not? Is your life so empty that you can afford 45-90 minutes of doing nothing for no reason?\n\nFirstly you feel like you are heading for a mob meeting when you get here. In the strip mall this place is located in you can get all your meth/stolen goods/unregistered firearm needs met by speaking to any of the helpful men in trench coats lurking throughout the parking lot. You know something is up because despite the squalor the parking lot is filled with Lexii, BMWs and cabs from the strip. \n\nWhen you get in you notice the place is very nice for being in a strip-mall and the place is plastered with knowledgeable people in the restaurant business lavishing praise over the place. Our table featured a picture of Mario Batali looking unimpressed. I don't know that I would have put that up there.\n\nThe beer list was excellent, the two Thai beers (Chang and Singha) were excellent as well. One oddity: they have Stone Pale Ale on the menu and when ordered I was presented with a Stone India Pale Ale instead, which was not on the menu. It's a completely different beer, but yet a pretty effing good one, so no biggee.\n\nWe had eggrolls. They were small and great. Then we had curry; Panang and Red. Also great. Also a fairly UnAmerican portion. You should be able to order a Larger portion of curry, I've never ran out of a main course before. Also their version of a \"7\" in hotness is comparable to a 9 at Pin Kaow. Shit was hot yo.\n\nGot out of there for less than a fifty with two people drinking beer. World class Thai food (Alledgedly, all I know it was spectacular). Will return. Quite happy."

You give them your phone number and they text you when you table is ready. We decided to go out and stop by the convenience store to pick up items we needed and with a surprise we got texted within about 30 minutes. I am giving this place a 5 because food was very good and I have been Bangkok before and food is comparable to it. Just as good or even better than some places in Thailand. Service was also wonderful, you don't expect much service at Asian restaurants but this was an exception. Probably first Asian restaurant I have been too where they had a host/hostess, bus boy, and waiter/waitress. I would love to come back again just to try other items.\n\nFood - 5/5   Very delicious and comparable to Thai food in Thailand. We had the crispy duck with Panang. Duck was extra crispy and that curry sauce was to die for!!! Also, had the Drunken noodle with Sea Bass. This was exceptional as well but I thought kind of pricey.

It totally lived up to the hype\n-Shrimp pad see ew: another friend recommended this dish and we enjoyed it.\n-Softshell crab noodles: this was our wild card but I really enjoyed it! It's a bit sweeter than the pad see ew and this turned out to be a nice combination of dishes.\n\nSolid 4- I'd come back!"

We were there at 5:45 and had no problems being seated right away. \n\nWe had the #14 nam kao tod meat salad, garlic prawns, tom kha gai soup and crispy duck on drunken noodles.  It was a lot of food, enough for a doggie bag for later too.  \nTo drink, Thai ice tea (creamy almost like an iced coffee) and a Thai Lime drink  (refreshing but too sweet, ask for less sugar). \n\nTotal came to around $75.00 for the two of us.  \n\nNow, I may be crucified for this but, it wasn't knock my socks off amazing.  It was delicious, but I've been spoiled with Thai food here in Toronto.  We go to Express Thai on Dufferin which is owned and operated by a Thai family, and I feel the flavours there are just as fresh and authentic as Lotus of Siam.  We ordered all the things that were rec'd to us, but next time I'll have to be a bit more adventurous with our choices to really experience the magic of this place."

However, husband had the crispy duck panang curry that is from the back of the menu and it was mind blowing.  Orgasmic.  No joke.  I have had Thai curry from many many places and this made the other places taste like sad watered down imitations.  Holy cow.  It was simple.  Just duck and curry.  No veggies in the curry.  However, that in itself was a flavor explosion.  It's not cheap.  It's $28 but it's worth it.  The portion is not big but it's worth it.  It's simply a symphony of flavors that dance on your palate. Rich and creamy.   Texture of the duck is amazing.  The duck skin is lightly battered and the fat is rendered beautifully. \n\nWe had an appetizer which was the Larb.  I thought it was good but not worth the price at $12.  You had to buy the sticky rice as an extra side at $2.50. Very very small serving.  Maybe two small hands worth.  Again, why are Asian restaurants charging for rice in Vegas??? You need the rice though b/c otherwise you are eating minced meat with...um....nothing.  There's nothing to eat it with b/c it's just a little bowl of minced meat.  \n\nService was very nice and the server gave us very good recommendations.  There was no wait for lunch on a weekday."

The Garlic shrimp was really tasty deep fried topped with garlic sauce I think it  was fried at a high temp the prawns  became cracklings you can eat the whole shrimp. Combination fried rice was different from Archi's a bit more salty not so sweet. \n\nThe northern Dish we tried however which is the eggplant with minced pork had a totally different flavor profile from the other thai resto's we tried locally in Vegas.  The dessert with mango and sticky rice had a unique flavor coconut milk with a tinge of chamomile or lavender were still discussing what they added which was a total surprise. \n\nThe whole Dining experience was really good. We will definitely come back for the other northern dishes and Chefs special on special occasion which is coming soon. For Vegas PEEPS as well as Visitors out of the country and out of STATE definitely a must try!!!"

This time Thai and Southeast Asian.  \n\nBut first - do not be alarmed when you actually find the place.  In a very shabby strip mall well off The Strip - a few crappy stores and eateries, a few boarded up places, a smattering of panhandlers and transients (trying real hard to be politically correct).  Look past all this and go in the front door - and prepare to be pleasantly amazed.\n\nVery large restaurant - crowded, hell of a wine cellar (in a Thai place - must be a Vegas thing).  Bit of a wait but not intolerable.  Polite and knowledgeable staff - and willing to take the time to explain the enormous menus and really help with your selection.\n\nStarted off with deep fried tofu and beef larb - off to a very good start.  A variety of main courses - and just a ridiculous amount of offerings to choose from.  Finally settled on the Rad Na, Nua Nam Tok and Koi Soi - all prepared well, plenty to eat and enough to share.  A good sampling for future visits.  Strong but not too strong Thai Ice Tea to wash it all down.\n\nJust remember - suck it up and make your way inside.  Well worth it"

They have all Thai classics at a standard Thai restaurant price and trust me  you don't JUST come here for the pad Thai and Tom yum. \n\nChef special are excellent! Crispy duck in curry woo and the must have---garlic prawns\n\n(Skip this if you don't want to hear about prawns sooooo good) Garlic pawns pricey but worth a drive to Vegas. They shell giant prawns but leave the shells attached. Coat the shelled fish in batter of garlicky goodness (not too much garlic) Deep fried both shells and prawns in extreme intensity so it looks like you have double the shrimp. If you don't like fried yummy shells you may feel a tiny bit jiped but they throw cilantro and green onions to make up for it (jk) the whole thing is delicious and stays crispy for hours. Really. I checked. So delicious.\n\nOverall it's what you expect from a Thai restaurant with a whole LOT you didn't expect. Like a very streamed lined staff. Food took a little time but the servers brought us appetizers, were always accessible, and were knowledgable to point out the water was filtered NOT tap. In a place that is always busy and with an award winning chef it is a culinary experience that is very worth it."

There will be homeless people asking you for money. This restaurant is in da hood. Who cares. You can offer them your leftovers (not the garlic shrimp though, which brings me to my next point...)\n\nOhhhhhh the yelpers are right. Always listen to us!!! Cos the garlic shrimp is so bomb diggity! They deep fry the whole damn thing and the shells and even the head are uber crispy and crusty (here, the crustacean can finally live up to its own name). They peel and devein the shrimp but the shell is still attached at the tail. So you take one bite of meat, then one bite of crispy shell, lick your fingers and your lips, and repeat, and hopefully you get to eat the last piece of the plate, because you'll most likely have to wait until your next Vegas trip to eat the shrimps again.\n\nMoving on. Yummy soft shell crab drunken noodles! I've had lots of drunken noodles with chicken, beef, pork, shrimp... But soft shell crab was unprecedented. The portion wasn't as big as I expected, but the flavors were all there! Order it and you won't be disappointed!\n\nSkip the tom kha and dessert. Flavor was bland, rice was hard and old!\n\nYum neau (beef salad) was worth a try. Make sure you order mild. Thai spicy cannot be undermined.\n\nYou might still have to wait for 5 to 10 mins even if you show up on time for your reservation, but at least they have a bar to let you have a drink while you wait. Service was awesome and staff were friendly.\n\nDespite the few disappointing dishes, the good dishes were exceptional and unique. This is still a 5 star Thai restaurant!"

I finally got a chance to try this place with one of my favorite people Dyanna. Since it was her lunch break we went at 1pm because at lunch time there can be a line out the door. \n\nThe outside building is run down, but the inside of Lotus is huge and very chic. I was surprised to find table linens and cloth napkins instead of paper. They have a huge wine cellar that greets you as you are being seated. The waiters and waitresses were also dressed up. Really made me feel fancy. \n\nLotus of Siam's menu is huge! They have anything and everything you could ever want when it comes to Thai food. I love that they separate the menu by regions of Thailand. In the end I decided on one of my favorite Thai dishes Pad See Ew with shrimp. (I used to be able to handle spicy food, but since my sleeve surgery three months ago my stomach can't handle it.) So I ordered a spice level 1. Dyanna ordered the Baby Corn and I think she got a level 6 or 7. \n\nOur food came out super fast. I have to say they made the best Pad See Ew that I've ever had! Talk about flavor! Wow! It exploded in my mouth. The noodles where all perfectly coated in sauce and were cooked al dente. Plus, they had it loaded with tender sweet shrimp. Dyanna let me try her Baby Corn dish and it was really tasty too. (I'm a total sucker for baby corn.) \n\nOur waiters were so attentive. When we were done they took both our dishes and boxed them up for us. They also brought our check quickly. Which is always nice when your on a time crunch. \n\nWhat a great lunch! Wonderful company and some bomb Thai food. I seriously can not wait to go back. I've been telling Joel I have to take him there. He had my left over Pad See Ew cold, hours later and he loved it.

Very interesting... it's like a chili dip accompanied by a bunch of things you can dip with.  I can't say I loved it, but it was definitely unique.  Wouldn't get it again but definitely worth trying out.\n2) Pad Thai - very good but the noodles are skinnier than your traditional pad thai.\n3) Drunken Noodles - SO Yummy!  \n4) Papaya Salad - very good!\n5) Fried Garlic Prawns - my favorite dish.  I loved how they took the shrimp OUT of its shell before they battered & fried it.  It was seasoned & cooked perfectly.\n6) Chicken Satay - just like any other Thai restaurant\n7) Yellow Curry with Chicken - the chicken was good cuts of breast meat & potato was cooked perfectly.  \n\nSome people say that this is the best Thai restaurant in America.  I don't know if I'd go that far... but then again, I can't name a Thai restaurant that I think is better.

Needless to say, we've become loyal customers.  There is often a wait for a table if going for dinner, so it's best to make reservations.  Lunch is rarely busy, so if you can go mid week, it's probably a great time to try.  You'll soon make reservations for dinner if you do!  The wait staff is not only knowledgeable, but also extremely efficient and helpful to those of us that don't know what to order.  This place does it RIGHT!"

They are always crowded.\nit is about $25 cab ride off the strip - $50 round-trip, so good thing the food is reasonably priced."

It was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and moist, flaky on the inside. It came with shredded salads topped with peanuts and prepared in a perfectly harmonious light fish sauce balanced with sweetness, acidity, heat, and saltiness. The sauce is so, so tasty I could literally eat white rice with just the sauce for a meal.\n\nThe pad thai was good.

The last time we were here I got green curry and he got panang curry (not the one with crispy duck, although we have gotten that before and it was excellent). We both liked the panang curry better but the green curry was delicious as well.\n\nUsually we also get the pork jerky or the beef jerky as an appetizer. The pork jerky is extremely juicy, the beef jerky is full of flavor, and both come with a fantastic sauce. My favorite thing on the menu is Tom Kah Kai soup, it is just the best thing on this planet. We haven't been brave enough to try the stranger things on the menu, but the menu is so extensive that it doesn't matter. If you don't know what to try, the staff are extremely helpful!\n\nWe usually order our food at a 2 or 3 which is spicy enough to make my eyes water a bit but not so spicy that I can't taste the subtler flavors. \n\nIn another review someone complained about only getting one bowl of rice. They do only give one bowl initially--that is so everyone at the table can take some and it's not just sitting there forever getting cold. If you ask for more rice they will give you as much as you want at no extra charge and it will be out about a minute after you request more (edit: apparently they charged for extra for the other reviewer--I don't know if they forget to charge me, don't charge because we are there often, or what).\n\n I have also seen a few people say that the portions are small. While I personally have always left Lotus full (and sometimes even with leftovers), it is true that the portions are smaller than at your average ten-pound-plate American restaurant. The intended way to eat (at least for the curry and saucy dishes) is that you use the rice to soak up the sauce--and since the sauce is delicious and the rice is unlimited, that is how you fill up if you are still hungry.\n\nThe pricing is extremely reasonable. Usually our bill runs about 50$ total--that is INCLUDING tax, tip, appetizer, two entrees, and drinks, and it's easy to keep it under 35$ for two people if you want. I would say this is the most underpriced restaurant in Vegas."

We wanted some veggies, so we split the Thai salad with boiled egg and vegetables (red onion, cucumber, tomato, carrots) topped with crispy wonton strips and the most delicious peanut sauce ever: subtle heat, strong peanut flavor, nice balance of complex flavors. \n\nThen we had the best pad Thai and red curry we've ever had. They both had nice flavors that didn't depend on loads or salt or sugar, which can be a hard find for Thai food in the U.S. \n\nThe outside of the restaurant looks like a hole in the wall, but the inside is bustling and busy. Celebs from top rated chefs to A-list actors have eaten there (signed photos line the walls), and the chef is a James Beard award winner. \n\nMake reservations to have the night go more smoothly, then go see a show on the strip.

If you follow the GPS directions you'll probably find an empty storefront. The restaurant is in the lot BEHIND the GPS location that I got. Yes it is in a creepy looking parking lot where it looks you might get \"surprised\" by some unsavory types. \n\nLooks aside the restaurant itself is really clean and the prices are actually on the low end given the trend of high-priced \"Thai\" food in a lot of cities these days. I assure you that the Thai food here is not the \"Thai\" food you get in a lot of places that obviously cater only to white people.\n\nTry the blood vermicelli."

I've never been a big fan of Thai cooking but I went along for the ride.  Since I've had limited experience, I'm in no place to judge how it ranks in the whole country but it now has my vote, for sure.\n\nEverything we had was wonderful.  Service was superb.  We couldn't believe how fast the food was served after we ordered.  We started with the fried jerky with a spicy sauce which I understood was a Northern Thai dish.  It was an interesting, unusual and tasty appetizer unlike anything we had ever eaten before.\n\nMy son had the crispy duck panang in a spicy cream sauce.  The waiter asked for his spicy preference on a scale of 1 to 10.  My son said 6, I said mild which the waiter translated as 2 and we both said our dishes were perfect.  I've never been a fan of duck but I tried a bite and it was very good.   The steamed vegetables he ordered as a side were picture perfect.\n\nI was tempted to try the whole smoked catfish but decided to start with something a little less ambitious.  I ordered the pan fried smoked catfish prepared with vegetables and a curry sauce.   Where I come from we eat a lot of catfish and this was one of the most delicious and unusual catfish dishes I have ever eaten.   This is a restaurant where you should step out of your comfort zone and you may be very pleasantly surprised."

But for Las Vegas, it's worth a shot!\n\nBrief Summary\n-- Location is off the strip, felt like \"middle of nowhere\"\n-- Must be a Local hot spot because it's packed and busy!\n-- Service was decent\n-- Food was pretty good\n-- Experience was just A-OK\n\nWith all of the high profile chef's having restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip or in the fancy, new hotels,  I would have NEVER thought of getting some Thai food in LV. Thanks to Yelp, I checked this place out with my GF and even called ahead and got a reservation on a busy Wednesday night!\n\nThis place doesn't look as big or as nice as it does inside. The outside made me feel like we were in the slums but the inside of the restaurant was very welcoming and nice. \n\nService was a little bit slow at times but eventually our server opened up and gave us a smile and great customer service. I guess he just needed some time to warm up.\n\n--- Our Order ---\n\n** Tom Kha Gai with veggies -- I think this one of the best dishes of the night. We asked for medium heat, and they delivered! The heat was strong when you ate the peppers in the soup, but otherwise it wasn't completely overbearing or too much. We were a little surprised at first but then were relieved that our mouths weren't completely on fire. We got the Hot Pot size and it was $14 ( a little expensive ), but the portions were HUGE. So it made sense. I definitely recommend this coconut based soup with chicken and vegetables.\n\n** Chicken Satay -- I like simple dishes. This dish was simple and delicious. BBQ chicken on skewers with a great peanut sauce and the cucumber salad. \n\n** Pad Thai with Chicken -- I'm not a fan of places that serve Pad Thai with ONLY a certain type of meat. I'm used to having some egg, chicken, tofu and shrimp in my noodles. So it would have been nice to have a few mroe ingredients, but in general the pad Thai was good. The noodles were a little bit thicker than what I like, but the flavor was very good. Pad Thai is the \"make or break\" dish for me, and I feel like they delivered well with the Pad Thai.\n\n** Pineapple Fried Rice -- This was probably the weakest dish. It wasn't very \"fried\" but more like a rice mixed with curry powder. It made the rice have a lackluster texture that was in between moist and dry. It was confusing. The pineapple did deliver a nice fresh crunch and juice, but I've had better.\n\nAfter going over my whole order, it wasn't that this place isn't good. Everything was good, but nothing WOW'd us or made me want to go out of my way for Thai in Las Vegas. If you're hankering for some Thai in LV, make a trip out here. Don't blink, or you'll miss it!\n\n** Quick Side Note -- They have a HUGE selection of Wine. If that's your \"thing\" then they will definitely be able to get you something that fits your meal."

The garlic shrimps I had were far too greasy. It was completely unappetizing.\nMy other half had the nam prik ong. It was alright, but he was unsure as to why it was the best dish Ming Tsai ever had. Mr. Man was completely underwhelmed... We've had Pok Pok (in Portland, OR) sticky rice, sticky rice at home, and many other restaurants. But here? It wasn't very good. Just sticky and cold.

This is not the kind of Thai food I grew up eating, and my family is from Thailand and Laos. \n\nWe got 6 dishes which we were to share amongst each other. Specifically: Chicken Kao Soi, the Crispy Duck in Chili Mint Leaves, Beef Pad See-ew, Spicy Chicken Wings, Papaya Salad, and Pork Larb. \n\nWe started out with the Papaya Salad and Larb. Holy crap, were the portions tiny. I make papaya salad and also cucumber salad (same concept but with cucumber) every week, at home, in huge portions and it's a very inexpensive dish to make. There's no reason why it was served in such a small portion and at that price. It does come with sticky rice, but still, more would've been nice. Especially between 6 people. The Larb was tiny too. Each of us had a tbsp full on our plates. lol. It was cute, but also quite sad. Both dishes were gross to me, personally. Since when do you put sesame oil in either of those dishes? It must be a regional thing. I don't know. Either way, it was gross. I don't make it that way, nor do any of my family or friends whom are from Thailand and Laos. The Papaya salad had very unbalanced flavors too, which is Papaya salad blasphemy. It tasted sweet and spicy, but no salt or tartness. Weird. The Larb would have been ok if it wasn't drenched in sesame oil. I liked the spices, which were different, but good. \n\nThe Entrees were also very tiny and mediocre. For a place with so much hype, I expected to be amazed. I wasn't. At least with most of the entrees. I didn't actually get to eat the duck or chicken wings, but I heard they were fantastic. My brother is a piggy, so he ate most of it. I pretty much sacrificed my food so everyone else could eat. Needless to say, I went to bed hungry that night. :(\n\nAs for the service, it was ok. Waiter didn't yell or throw stuff at us, so that was good. :P"

We settled on the garlic prawns since everyone on Yelp seemed to agree that they were a must, Tom Kha, Larb, and the Drunken Seafood Noodles. Everything was great!

It's not the unassuming building or the location. It's the buffet lunch that they put out there. DON'T try the buffet lunch. Again, DON'T get the buffet lunch. It's terrible. We were there around 12:30 on a Friday and  the steam table trays were half empty. They also took their time replenishing the food, which was slightly better than mediocre, which is not saying much. Service for the buffet was also terrible. Seems like the wait and kitchen staff were more intent on taking care of the menu customers than the buffet customers. I don't understand why restaurants do this. If you are going to offer a buffet, at least keep it hot and full at all times even if the food is not good. If we didn't know about this place, the buffet experience would have turn us off completely and we would never come back. I am tempted to give this place a 3 star except that the food off the menu was so much better and a better representation of this place.\n\nWe came back again with great trepidation to try out the menu. Our buffet experience was so bad that we almost didn't come back. We were glad to give them one more chance. They have a great menu and offered northern dishes that we don't see a lot. Food came out quickly and the wait staff was always attentive (unlike the Buffet). Garlic Prawns were fantastic as were the sour rice salad, Khao Soi and the other dishes that we ordered. Their food certainly had more depth to it than what you would find at a typical place.\n\nUltimately, was this the best Thai restaurant in the nation, probably not. The lunch buffet was a waste of time and money. It shouldn't even be offered for a restaurant like this, where the menu is the gem. However, the menu item were certain unique and good enough that we will come back next time we are in town. for the menu items, NOT the buffet."

A great dish. The problem? $24. I don't think I'd go down that road again. \n\nKhao Soi Beef- awesome little noodle dish. On spice level 7, it was hot enough to make me sweat a bit, but doesn't overwhelm. The noodles were long, the beef was tender and the curry was light, but packed a punch.

If you love hot and spicy, then you won't be disappointed. Before the heat kicked in, I really enjoyed the flavor. Three full glasses of ice water later and I was able to finally taste the next dish.\n\nFor the main course, we ordered the yellow chicken curry.

No skimping on crab whatsoever! Would order again forsure.\n- Drunken Noodle Prawn ($22.95)- My least favorite dish of the night. I felt the large, flat noodles were bland.

So why would I need to add one more review to an overwhelming outpouring of opinion?  Just to add some cautions:\n\n1) Make the chefs happy and go for the back of the menu where the specialties are.  Don't even think about ordering Pad Thai!\n\n2)  If you like Riesling, they have an overwhelming list.  But we always seem to get a bottle that has gone into secondary fermentation.  If you consider a bit of gas to be a fault (as I do), you'll likely have to return it for something else.  Or just give up and enjoy the bubbly!\n\n3)  Watch the temp on the spice, it gets hot FAST.  Bring facial tissues and enjoy the heat.\n\n4)  MAKE RESERVATIONS, ASAP!  While they seem to make every effort to accommodate those without, this place is ridiculously popular and will always be booked up.\n\n5)  Don't judge a book by its cover.  When you pull up, it will look like a dump.  The area is old, run down and looks a bit scary, though it's largely abandoned.  Go inside and you will find a nice restaurant.\n\nBut do go and try it.

            "review": "The only thing that Lotus of Siam did wrong was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. What do I mean? Well, it had the misfortune of 1) being the dinner we ate AFTER having gone to Jose Andres' e' and 2) being visited a few months AFTER the wife and I had eaten in Portland's Pok Pok.\n\nIf it weren't for those two things, this would've been a five star review all the way. But alas, it wasn't the best meal I'd eaten in 24 hours (though, yes, an unfair comparison) let alone the best Thai I'd had (by which I mean the aforementioned Pok Pok.)\n\nSo let me stop the comparisons and just talk about our experience. It's in a strip mall--a sketch strip mall at that. Some (my overly critical parents, for example) might find that a turn off. Others (a-hole Yelpers like me for example) add points given a genuine hole-in-the-wall status. Thankfully, the sketch doesn't extend to the interior.\n\nWe had a group of six. We'd made reservations about a month previous so we had few (if any) hiccups (though we did heed the advice of showing up exactly on time.) The wine list was impressive by hole-in-the-wall Thai joint standards. Actually, it wasn't bad from an objective standpoint either. We'd ordered a few bottles of Reisling, letting the sweetness of the wine counter the spiciness of the food and allowing each diner to bathe in the unfettered air of foodie douchebaggery.\n\nI ordered the BBQ Pork (Moo Yang). It was tasty and I was pretty pleased with it, though it was kind of one-note. Also, it reminded me of the pork I'd eaten at Tu Lan's, a shady Vietnamese place in SF. Now that's not a bad comparison since I LOVED that pork, but I'd expected something a bit more...Thai.\n\nMy wife ordered a green curry dish. She said it was \"okay,\" and indeed, my sampling of it concurred. She groused, though. \"From the reputation of this place, I was expecting to be blown away.\" Yeah, I guess so. Then again, some places shine with their unexpected dishes--their specials and such--while phoning it in on the same ol', same ol'. I guess this could be one of those places. In fact, I hope so. It's really hard to tell since the majority of our group went the \"5 different varieties of curry\" route and they too were mildly disappointed.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe service was good and friendly. My pork was tasty. The wine flowed easily. But most of my group were perplexed and questioned the LoS's reputation. I don't know, man. Why didn't you guys order the whole fish if you wanted to see what they can do?\n\nAs you can see, I'm a bit torn. I'll give LoS the benefit of the doubt and grant them four stars at least. Hopefully I can return someday and see what they can REALLY do."

I loved the food the first time around, it's just that my friends and I have been trying to go to all the restaurants we discover on Yelp!  When I ate there last year, it was before the restaurant had been remodeled.  It was a small space for such a popular restaurant, and reservations seemed to be the way to go.  Now that should have changed with the recent remodel, which added more dining space, a bar and large wine selection.\n\nAll of the dishes I've had here have been delicious.  I could live off of the pad thai and crab fried rice.  (Funny story about the crab fried rice: during our first visit we were trying to order fried rice, but with chicken or shrimp, something that wasn't crab.  Our pushy waitress told us, \"No, you want the crab fried rice.\"  After she repeatedly insisted we get that, we gave in; we were not disappointed.  We DID want the crab fried rice, we just didn't know it yet!)  I can't comment as to what other dishes I've had there, as I'm not very familiar with thai food.  The only other thai restaurants I have under my belt are Archi's Thai Kitchen and Thai Spice (where I always get the orange chicken...).\n\nAs you can probably tell by most of the reviews, the food ranges from good to outstanding.  I'll let you read everyone elses reviews since, like I said, I'm not well versed when it comes to thai.  However, the one thing I do feel I need to talk about is the service.  It is absolutely great that the dining space has been expanded, allowing more tables for guests to be seated at.  What I don't like is that the waiters/waitresses did not appear to be assigned to a specific area or set of tables.  There were a lot of employees working during the Friday night I went there, many of whom served my table at one point or another.  I don't think we had the same server visit our table twice that night, which made it annoying when trying to flag someone down.  I can't count the number of times I saw a server with a tray of food standing around looking lost and confused, wondering which table the order belonged to.  Trying to get more water, order more dishes, order dessert, or get the check was a trial in patience.\n\nDoes the quality of the food outweigh my bad experience with the service?  Yes, it does.  But when i recommend this place to friends, the recommendation will always be accompanied by a footnote to be prepared to do a lot of sitting and waiting."

            "review": "I decided to check this place out after seeing it highlighted in an episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. In short, the restaurant definitely lives up to the hype.\n\nDespite walking in on a Friday night without a reservation we were able to get a table with a relatively short wait of about 15 minutes. I absolutely love the wait system, Waitlist Me, that the restaurant employs. After giving my name and phone number, I received a text indicating my estimated wait time and a link to a website showing my spot in the wait queue. Granted, the wait time estimate was somewhat off as it was 45 minutes initially, but seeing your place in the wait queue gives you a good idea of the remaining wait. Moreover, when our table was ready I received a text with the option to confirm or request an extra 15 minutes (presumably if you decide to go elsewhere during a long estimated wait).\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to grab some drinks at the bar while waiting. I was surprised that the place had such an extensive list of wines available (in addition to their also extensive sake selection). They seemed to specialize in German rieslings, so I ordered a glass. I was not disappointed.\n\nWe found the staff to be very friendly and attentive. They were constantly floating around and checking in to know if we needed anything. And luckily, as we were pressed for time to get to a concert, the food preparation was quick.\n\nBased on a tip from the show, we stuck to the northern Thai specialties. We ordered three items: Khao Soi, Sai Oua, and Thum Ka Noon. The Khao Soi and Thum Ka Noon were the agreed upon favorites. They were both just oh so flavorful. My personal favorite was the Thum Ka Noon, but my girlfriend preferred the Khao Soi. The Sai Oua was also very tasty, but, possibly because it was somewhat spicy, didn't leave the same impression as the other dishes. I'm not really a fan of spicy dishes, but if you are, then I'd recommend it as well."

It was juicy and great in taste but a bit hard to rip \napart both with the knife and teeth. I was kind of sore in my jaw after the appetizer like ive had a bunch of jaw breakers but it was so tasty i couldnt stop eating.......... \n\nI couldnt decide on what entr\u00e9e to choose so i took chicken with cashewnuts and oystersauce and the beef panang. The waiter asked how spicy we wanted the food from a 1-10 rating..... \nSince we all love really spicy food like thai and indian and ive spent several weeks in thailand i took 7 on my dishes. BAD CHOICE.......it was so spicy i almsot fell of my chair and by far the most spicy food i have ever had. We sat in silent the four of us but in the end ate ALL of the food. \n\nThat was how good it was. The flavours came through even though the spicyness and the beef and chicken was very fresh. We drank ALOT of water with the food but wouldnt hesitate eating here again. Would not go over 5 next time when it comes to the level of spicyness. \n\nPrices are good with appetizers from 6-9 and most entr\u00e9es around 10-12 $."

            "review": "Widely regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in the country, Lotus of Siam sits in a semi-dilapidated strip mall.  But don't let the surroundings fool you.  The food here is excellent.  Saipin Chutima was nominated for best chef in the Southwest Region by the James Beard Foundation in 2008.\n\nThe classic Pad Thai is a great rendition.  The noodles aren't overcooked, and the sauce is subtle enough to let the flavor of each ingredient shine through.\n\nThe Sua Rong Hai (charbroiled beef) is a great dish.  Tender, flavorful slices of perfectly cooked beef come with sauce that is somewhat on the spicy side, but not overly so.  The sauce compliments the beef perfectly, instead of overpowering it.\n\nThe Nam-Prik-Noom (Green chili dip) comes with an assortment of vegetables along with fried pork rinds.  Although flavorful, this wasn't as spicy as I was expecting.  A little more heat would have brought an extra dimension to this dish.\n\nThe Musaman Curry is unlike anything I have ever had before.  If you are a fan of Satay and enjoy the peanut sauce that comes along with it, you will absolutely love this dish.  It is like a curried version of the peanut sauce, with roasted peanuts, potatoes, carrots, and chicken.  This is a little on the sweet side, but not cloyingly so.\n\nThe Thai Beef Salad was the best thing I had on the night.  Although relatively simple, the salad was just bursting with flavor.  An explosion of lime juice, fish sauce, and heat make every bite leaving you wanting more.  The beef is very tender and juicy.\n\nThe thing that seems to set Lotus of Siam apart from just about every other Thai restaurant is the BOLDNESS of flavor in each dish and every bite."

Their website says the buffet is served until 2:30, but when we arrived at 1:45, we noticed a sign in the window (dated 2003!) saying lunch ends at 2. The buffet was totally picked over, they didn't restock any of the interesting items, half of the trays were full of either non-thai food (tempura? egg-drop soup?) or filler (shrimp chips, fried wonton skins). One curry, one stir fry, one thai soup... and all of it lukewarm. The only salad was iceberg and miso dressing. Nobody every asked us if we wanted drinks, we had to beg for water refills. Avoid the lunch buffet at all costs.\n\nOriginal (four star) Review 11/06:\nAll the reviews below that call this place \"the best Thai restaurant in the country\" are, frankly, doing this place a disservice. It's a creditable Thai restaurant, and they certainly serve some of the best Thai food I've had since San Francisco's Thep Phanom took its nosedive into mediocrity. Every dish we tried was tasty and properly balanced, the service was attentive and welcoming, and the menu's impressive in its diversity. And, of course, there's an undeniable pleasure of finding such a gem amid the underbelly of Old Vegas seediness.\n\nBut unless you've spent your life eating ketchup-y pad thai, Lotus of Siam is not going to change the way you think about Thai food. But that's not the point, nor should it be. If you go expecting a palate-altering experience at a trek-worthy temple of gastronomy, you'll certainly come away disappointed. Go, instead, hungry for a well-made, casual dinner in an atmosphere that couldn't be less \"Vegas\" if it tried."

We were there 15min after it opened, but had over an hour wait for a table of two.  It was a real test of will power that we stayed since we had not eaten a meal today and had hiked through the Valley of Fire.  So by the time we sat down, we were ready to order.  Luckily, things came out within 10min of ordering.  Actually, we were sat in view of the kitchen and got to see Saipan herself run the kitchen.  She really does everything...she ran my container of sticky rice out.  I thought it refreshing that she didn't feel herself too important for such a menial task.  I ordered mostly Northern Thai cuisine:  nam prik noom (spicy green chili veggie dip to be eaten with fresh veggies, pork rind, and my favorite, sticky rice), koi soi (thai beef tartare), a catfish dish, and (don't think this is issan) drunken noodle with soft crab.  Everything was good.  Thai food is known for is cacophony of seemingly unmatched flavors that come together harmoniously in the final dish.  It's an experience for your mouth.  We've been to the Northern area of Thailand, and it's very authenti...not that we need to tell you guys that.  Though my husband thought everything was just ok until we got to the final dish:  Pad Thai.  I know, right?  We're at a Northern Thai restaurant, and we order Pad Thai.  I read that it was good, and I wanted to compare this dish to others I've had.  Though I disagree with husband on this one, he said that he'd come back just for this dish.  I'm not against that at all since there was a jackfruit dish I'm still quite curious about.  (There were a lot of foods we didn't get to try on our trip.)

The place was very full on a Monday night, but we got in and out of there quickly to make our show.  Service very friendly and efficient.  We got the pad thai, which was the best ever!  Usually the noodles taste bland, but these had a real tasty flavor.  We also had a curry pork which was also very good.  Other Thai restaurants could learn from Lotus of Siam!"

            "review": "A reservation documented incorrectly was quickly corrected by the lovely ladies of Lotus of Siam. (penciled in for Saturday instead of Friday). We were seated despite the mix up AND before our \"reservation\" time.  Low and behold, I am impressed, we were off to a good start! \n\nWith all of my party seated and accounted for, our food server for the evening promptly took down our appetizer orders. Much to my continued surprise by the stellar service at this Thai house of awesomeness, our food arrived in a timely fashion and our orders were not only CORRECT, but none forgotten! \n\nThe only glitch in the evening was during dinner service; one or two meals trickled out behind the rest. When I inquired within, it was explained that they have several cooks preparing at different stations so the timing for each meal prepared is not always exactly on point with the rest. With that being said, all is forgiven for these delicious eats.\n\n It's quite a daunting task for most restaurant establishments to place the correct order, number one, let alone place it and not forget to bring it all to the table at the same time.\n\nMy take on food quality is this. Quite tasty. Being oh so unoriginal, I ordered the Pad Thai and vegetable fried rice. I know, I know.. for someone so creative there is a lot to be said about my creativity while dining..but I digress.\n\nThe Pad Thai was exceptionally delicious, not dry, noodles cooked to perfection. Dislike: the server did fail to ask me at what heat level I would like my dish therefore I was left with absolutely NO spice what so ever. I may be unoriginal in dining dish decision making, but I do like to spice things up..with spices.\n\nIn closing, Lotus of Siam's exceptional customer service, attention to detail (& ability to overcome clarical errors), and hell attention to our large party in general would have us coming back for more."

            "review": "Took two tries to actually eat here. First night (Sunday) I tried to make a reservation and they told me after the waiting list gets long enough, they stop taking reservations - you better just show up and get on the list. So we tried again Monday. This time we showed up in person and got on the list. Not too hard to spot - if you're travelling eastbound on Sahara heading away from the Strip you'll eventually see the backside of a dingy mall and LOTUS OF SIAM quite visible on the wall on the south side of Sahara. You then make the next turn and find a parking spot in the mall close to the restaurant. Shouldn't be hard at night since most of the businesses are either closed or not anywhere near as busy as Lotus Of Siam. We had about an hour's wait and the waiting area only has a few chairs so we decided to venture the mall outside. The rest of the mall is mostly Korean bars or restaurants plus a few sketchy \"clubs.\" None of the restaurants seemed to be \"hopping.\" Lotus Of Siam probably had more people in it than all the surrounding businesses combined. There were lots of shuttered businesses - perhaps this was once a thriving Koreatown in Las Vegas but this mall's best days are definitely in the past. Maybe it's a lot more thriving during the day but walking around there at night gave me a kinda creepy vibe. So we circled the whole place and came back and were seated not long after. I guess some folks couldn't wait any longer and left as a few names the hostess called out did not produce any acknowledgement from the people still sitting and waiting. There were so many people in the restaurant that when we finally got seated almost elbow to elbow next to the people at the tables on either side it felt like we were in a crowded diner. Couldn't they just buy out one of the bigger empty lots around and expand? So anyway, we ordered the crispy duck in Panang curry, the crispy garlic prawns, and our squeamish pal ordered the Panang curry with chicken. The crispy duck was awesome. So were the prawns - you eat the whole thing - shell and all - as we were instructed by our waiter. The Panang curry with chicken was rather lackluster in comparison but that was pretty much eaten by our unadventurous buddy who won't eat seafood and for whom duck was too exotic. Based on the first two dishes I'd say this place lives up to the hype. Portions weren't overly huge and the price was a little steep but we left satisfied. We'll probably be back one day. I'll say it would probably be worthwhile to check this place out if you're actually quite familiar with Thai food. Especially if you flew in from out of town - paying a king's ransom for cab fare from the strip and back as well as the long wait will seem much more worth it."

It's totally worth any wait though.\nThey have an impressive wine selection (a lot of rieslings) and everything on their menu is great. I always go with the Pineapple fried rice, spice level 8. It's so flavorful and the pineapple adds the appropriate amount of sweetness to offset the spiciness. A great appetizer is the crispy rice or the garlic wings. Seriously, you need to get the wings. The fried garlic is mouthwatering and the wings are so crispy.\nIt's totally worth the trek over, if you're in Las Vegas and don't eat here you're making a mistake."

As a big fan of Thai food, I thought I was going to have a great meal, but.........NOT!!!!\n\nLocated in a delapitated strip mall of other restaurants  and shops, this hole in the wall I thought.......might be a surprise and thus this is why there were so many positive reviews on YELP.  However, my experience was not such.\n\nYou walk in and the entrance is small and 3 people can not stand comfortably.  It's a small area then you're at the cashier's and the front room is dated and has painted green lattice partitions.  The rugs appeared dirty and the lighting was dim.  this is the area we were seated.  There's another section to th right of this and you can tell it's a newer updated area and open and looked lighter and cleaner.  the bathrooms appear to be remodeled and was nice and clean.\n\nI wanted to try the buffet for $8.99 that seemed reasonable, but they didn't offer any curry dishes, or popular Thai dishes.  the variety was lacking compared to when you go to an Indian buffet restaurant.  they offered only had about 8 entrees, 2 soups, 6 misc of salad, fried shrimp chips, fried banana, fried curry pouches, apple slices and orange slices and that's it.   I was disappointed and do not recommend their buffet at all.   \n\nthey had 2 types of soups, duck soup which had bits of duck and was greasy and the other was a egg flower soup and was good.   They had pad thai, but it was nothing special, the fried garlic wings was good, the other dishes were just alot of stir fry vegetables, and a chow mein style noodle dish.  a green salad with ranch dressing, I didn't understand how this is Thai....why didn't they have payaya salad.  Overall, it was more of a chinese buffet type food then all Thai food.\n\nMy partner ordered the Pad Sew flat noodle dish, but the waiter came out with another dish altogether.  A disappointment, but he liked the dish anyway.   It was a beef stir fry with cashews and a bowl of rice. \n\nthe waiter charged us for the incorrect dish that cost more, and he wouldn't correct the bill bc he said we accepted the dish and didn't return it back to the kitchen.  He wasn't very nice about this and the mistake was most likely due to a language barrier communication.\n\nSo DO NOT go for the buffet.  Make sure you double check your order to get the right dish...best to point to the item on the menu, since English is not their first language.\n\nMost of the dishes were about $9. to $15. per entree and that's expensive compared to the bay area, probably bc they have to ship it to LV.\n\nI can't comment on their Thai dishes, but can say that the buffet is not worth it, and they should get rid of the buffet or expand it and keep it freshly stocked and not sitting there for so long.  No one refilled any of the pans when I was there."

The other half is sealed up with drywall, leaving very limited seating and long lines. \n\nAt lunch #1: we ordered off the menu.  \n\nDRUNKEN NOODLES with PRAWNS:  The prawns were fanastically fried, with the shells semi attached, which are like the best shrimp crackers ever.  They were so addictively well fried and well seasoned.  The noodles, however, were sooo meager in portion that it almost makes me angry.  I'd actually consider bartering with the chef.  I'll give her back a few prawns just for a few more noodles.  The dish is littered with fried, seasoned garlicy basil leaves.  Nothing is mixed though so it's a bit of a mystery how to eat this. \n\nPAD THAI:  Tiny little noodles and it makes your neighborhood Thai place embarrassed to use ketchup! \n\nNAM KAO TOD: Crispy rice with sour sausage seasoned with ginger, lime.  OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.  The flavors were so intense and funky.  With a bite of raw cabbage and cucumbers in between each bite of rice, this was my favorite dish of the day. \n\nLUNCH #2:  Lunch buffet.  Vegetarian pad thai, some kind of curry (e.g. red, yellow), vegetable tempura, some kind of soup (e.g. egg drop, hot and sour), fresh fruit, fried rice, white steamed rice, various stir fries, orange chicken.  Only order this if you're wanting huge portions of pad thai.  I did like the banana rolls for dessert.  Banana wrapped in egg roll wrappers along with some shredded coconut and deep fried.  \n\nMmm, next time I'll skip the buffet and order more adventurously off the menu."

The service is always quick and the turnaround is amazing especially since it is always packed.\n\nBe weary of the incredibly long wait that you will most likely encounter when you arrive at the restaurant - I arrived an hour before they closed and I still had to wait 30-45 minutes before I could get a table! However, they send you a text to see a list of other people who are also waiting so that you can leave and come back once the table is ready. There's also a bar where those who are 21+ can wait -- with their wine cellar who can resist?! (I had to drive, so I had to.)\n\nHere's what I had:\n\nBeef pad thai (4/5) // I wasn't expecting the portion to be as small as it was since I'm so used to Thai restaurants giving a hefty load when it comes to pad thai; however, the quality of the food was top notch and the noodles were thinner than what I'm used to. Usually I can never finish portions of pad thai, but this was just enough to fill up my belly!\n\nMango sticky rice (4/5) // I felt like the mango sticky rice was a little overpriced for the portion they give, but nevertheless the mango was just as sweet as I expected it to be.\n\nAlthough Lotus is so famous, it didn't really blow me away. Maybe it's because I had such high expectations or maybe it's because I've gone to numerous other Thai restaurants that delivered a better price to portion ratio... but nevertheless for my experience I can't say that it's the best, but the Pad Thai was pretty scrumptious."

It's just that it's hard to stay motivated to cook aggressively and ambitiously when the clientele isn't aggressive or ambitious in its ordering and dietary habits. This fault isn't particular to ethnic restaurants: most high-end restaurants succumb to the same pattern of early greatness followed by plateau and then slow, steady decline (if they ever reach the heights to begin with).\n\nTo be fair, the food was very good. It was not extraordinary or even top 10%. Fresh mushroom salad was an interesting idea, half-realized. The two shrimp that accompanied the salad were fine, but not of the same quality as at a much more unprepossessing restaurant I visited two nights later. The salad itself was a bit monochromatic.\n\nI did enjoy a dry beef liver entree, though it was not nearly as spicy as my server averred. He helpfully provided some condiments and recommendations. \n\nMy server, in fact, helped me to my conclusion that LoS wasn't terrific. I'd gone to LoS expecting that it would be overrated. But I don't like to prejudge. My server was more enthusiastic in recommending other Thai restaurants than he was in talking about his own menu. I do not mean that he was unprofessional or that he spoke negatively about his employer. It was just clear by his demeanor that he prefers to eat elsewhere."

And finally the Khoa soi with sliced beef was just as good. This place is worth going off the strip for and Jim the server could not have been any better."

I'm very thankful we didn't have to wait outside for a table...\n\nHonestly, I've experienced better.  There are so many places to eat in Las Vegas, and I would make this one of the last places I would ever want to go back to.  The place looks like a gem, compared to everything else in that strip mall.  Perhaps their going for a \"hole in the wall\" effect. But overall, their prices and taste don't match up, in my opinion.  \n\nThe service was not so good.  The table next us complained numerous times about the waitress not getting their food right. I wasn't happy about seeing an automatic charge of 18% gratuity being automatically added to our bill.  -- There were only 3 of us.  I know we were pleasant guests since we had a very simple order and didn't demand anything of the staff. \n\nWhat did we order?\nBeef Penang - it was ok\nPad Thai - ok\nCrispy Prawns - or whatever that expensive appetizer was called - ok\n\nI am a person that likes to Instagram good food from places I like to eat.  I seriously didn't have the heart to do so for this place... I just couldn't do it it my friends. I wouldn't want them to waste time here either. \n\nI hate writing bad reviews.  But I seriously am still not happy with the time and dollars I spent there. The money  I can always replace, but the time wasted during our vacation I'll never get back."

It was authentic feeling and had a home-cooked taste.  We ordered the whole fish, shrimp, noodles, soup, and pineapple rice for dessert.  It was more than enough for 6 people and the price was reasonable.  I plan on coming back every time I am in Vegas.  Another reason to avoid the strip and discover the rest of Vegas!"

We experienced this little gem on a Friday night and, at least that night, I'm glad we had reservations. The restaurant was packed. So, consider yourself warned ... we were told they would only hold reservations for five minutes. You snooze, you lose.\n\nThe restaurant is somewhat casual, so shorts and a tee-shirt would have sufficed, but a few of our group of four were dressed for a show and gambling at one of the upscale properties. Each of us would have felt comfortable either way.\n\nThe delight of Lotus of Siam is not the decor or the layout; it's the food. Sooooo good. And there are more selections than one might need -- but who's to complain?! We ordered four entrees: Garlic Prawns (at the suggestion of the server); Chicken Panang; Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles (again, at the suggestion of the server); and Pineapple Fried Rice.\n\nAll were excellent choices. The Garlic Prawns topped with ground black pepper were oh-so-lightly deep fried in their paper thin shells. No need to peel these crispy little delicacies -- eat 'em shell and all! The Chicken Panang contained plenty of thinly sliced chicken breast medallions soaking in a heavenly, light curry/coconut/basil/chili sauce. You may need to keep the sticky rice bowl handy, as the Panang and sticky rice mix well together. The Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles had a nice contrast of flavors between the fresh chili and Thai basil, while the fish itself maintained the mellow flavor characteristic of good sea bass. And, finally, the Pineapple Fried Rice containing curry powder, pineapple, shrimp and chicken was a good little addition -- especially with the contrast of the pineapple to the traditional Thai flavors of the other entrees.\n\nI can't eat Thai food without a Singha lager beer, which I enjoyed. Others in my group shared a bottle of wine from a reasonably long list of wines from various areas of the world. (They selected a Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand -- which at least is from the same hemisphere as Thailand!)\n\nThis was the best Thai food restaurant that I've been to, hands down. And I've been to Thailand!"

My first thought was, \"Wow, this parking lot is sketchy looking.\" There are hardly any street lights. When I parked, I parked next to some Audi that had its front end smashed in and 4 flat tires. Then while walking to the entrance of the restaurant, some very sketchy-looking white male on a bicycle started to make up some story about \"his wife\" then asked for money. We just kept walking because who knows what kind of bicycle shenanigans he might pull off. We put our names down on the decent sized waiting list, went back outside, and moved my car just to get some piece of mind in the dodgy parking lot. It seemed like no one hung around outside of the restaurant which added onto the sketchiness. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for 2 people.\n\nThe food was delicious with lots of flavor and textures. We pretty much only ordered from the chef's specialty section:\n1) drunken noodle with soft shell crab\n2) deep fried garlic prawns\n3) nam kao tod\n\nAll the food was a little spicy yet yummy. Again, it was my last Vegas thing of the day before heading 3 hours west and I was already awake for a long time gambling and such so I was almost falling asleep in here. Maybe my review would be different if I had more energy or was drinking.\n\nIf you plan to check this place out, make a reservation so you can minimize the time your car is in a danger zone. You'll be surprised with how big it is inside the restaurant."

            "review": "In my humble foodie opinion, Lotus of Siam has the best Thai food in Vegas and possible in the country (based on their food on the menu, not lunch buffet). How did I reach this conclusion? \n\n- Well let's start with the food itself. The food is phenomenon. I have eaten Thai food in so many places and food at LoS is so much better in term of taste,  flavors, spices, and quality. When I slurped the soup, I could tell the sweetness and flavor came from bones/meat  being stewed for hours, and NOT from loads of MSG many other places threw in to mask the sweetness. They seasoned the food so nicely that your tongue can taste the sourness, sweetness, spiciness and all other flavors at the same time without one overtaking others. The quality is always so fresh.  Food cooked here are truly being made with care and fitted for royalty. \n\n- This restaurant used to be hole in the wall kind of restaurant but since expanded out and lookw much nicer inside. This restaurant is also located in a kinda shading commercial center that you normally would not visit if you're familiar with that area. But guess what?  This restaurant is packed every night and you wouldn't believe how many people took taxi and limousines all the way from the strip to dine at this place. There is usually a line waiting outside even before the restaurant is opened for dinner. If you plan to come late, I recommend getting a reservation ahead of time.\n\n- The chef, Saipin Chutima, has won so many awards and is considered one of the best chefs in the country. The restaurant is Zagat rated and so many celebrities and famous chefs dined at this place.\n\nIn term of price, I think they are very reasonable for the quality of food you get here. At least here, you truly get what you pay for, unlike some other crappy places in the strip that charge you an arm and a leg for crappy food. \n\nDon't believe me? Go try their dinner menu and you can see/taste for yourself."

I thought it was ridiculous that we went so early since we were the only ones waiting in line. lo and behold, 10 minutes later, the line was down the block. doors opened at 5:30PM and the reservations line gets seated first. then my party was first in line to get a table since we got there so early. i looked around as we ordered and the restaurant filled up quickly. \n\nthe restaurant is known for it's northern Thai food so leave the traditional Pad Thai at home. my party decided to order a bunch of food and just share it family style. we had 2 orders of their garlic prawns, the chicken khao soi (chicken served on a bed of egg noodles in a curry base sauce, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables), nam kao tod (Crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice), drunken noodle soft shell crab, panang curry with crispy duck, and a beef dish... I believe it was the Pad Prik Sod (Choice of meat saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers, fresh chili pepper, & onions). we all also ordered the Thai Iced Tea which is delicious and highly recommended. I love that you can really taste the tea flavor yet it was still sweet and creamy. \n\nwhen the food came, we were all ready to chow down. they also gave us a basket of rice and said that if we needed more, we could just ask. the dishes seemed small but for some reason, we had a party of 8 and were still not able to finish all the food. everything was amazing and tasted super fresh. I would definitely recommend the garlic prawns and any dish with the crispy duck. \n\nof course we all wanted to get a dessert before we left so we ordered one mango sticky rice to share amongst us. the mango was so ripe and sweet. the coconut sticky rice was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of sweet coconutty aroma to balance out the mango. i normally dont like sticky rice desserts but I can definitely come back for this one! \n\noverall, amazing food, great service, nice atmosphere. the restaurant looks deserted in the middle of an empty plaza if you arrive early, but don't judge a book by it's cover! I can see why it's the most highly rated Thai restaurant in Vegas. you have to give it a try if you're in this area! Truly unique restaurant that you would never imagine to find in all the glitz and glamour of Vegas."

            "review": "I recently visited Las Vegas for a week and was told by multiple sources that this was the place to go.  \n\nWe called at around 7pm on a Tuesday to make a reservation for the same night and was told that they do not take same day reservations and it fully booked for the night but if we were to do a walk-in the wait was 20 minutes. I am from New York, a 20 minute wait for ANY type of food is considered fast. When we arrived there was no one in the waiting area except my friends and I. We were told there would be a 10 minute wait by the lady at the register until a waitress walked by and told us to follow her. I am pretty confident I know what a fully booked restaurant looks like because when I looked around, it sure wasn't it. There were literally 5 tables out of say 30 that were occupied. Rule #1: Don't lie, it just makes you look really bad.\n\nAs for the food: We ordered Pad se-ew, drunken noodles with crispy duck, green curry with chicken, seafood chili and basil leaves, and two orders of sticky rice. The sticky rice was lukewarm, hard, and not the usual glutinous texture. The noodles for the pad se-ew were good but the dish was fairly bland. The flavor of the green curry with chicken was great but it left us wondering where the chicken was. The \"slices\" were almost as if they were minced. The seafood chili and basil leaves was, for the lack of a better word, awkward. The flavor of the dish did not penetrate the seafood. Besides the initial flavor upon biting, the rest of the seafood tasted as if it was boiled in plain water. The best tasting of our dishes was the drunken noodles with the crispy duck but even this had issues. There were approximately 4 pieces of duck and enough noodles to feed 1.5 people. Even though it was advertised as \"crispy\" the skin of the duck was soggy. \n\nOverall, with this being our last meal in Vegas, we were sorely disappointed. As great as our vacation was, we wanted to end it on a high note by going to a place that others have claimed to have a \"cult following.\" I am sorry to say that for my friends and I, Lotus of Siam does not belong on the pedestal everyone has placed it on."

During lunch hours, they serve a buffet. I'm not sure what kind of food was in the buffet but it seemed very popular. We ordered off the menu and got the Nao Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, Garlic Prawns, and Roasted Duck Curry. You could adjust the spiciness for each dish. They go from scale 1-10. We decided on going with 5 for all the spicy dishes. The food took a while to come out but we didn't mind since we did come during the lunch rush. The Nao Kao Tod came first and it was a very interesting crispy rice salad. It was slightly tangy and when you eat it with the cabbage provided, it's the perfect blend of crunchy, zesty, and freshness. I have never had anything like this so I truly enjoyed it! The Tom Kah Kai came out next and this was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the taste was off, maybe too much coconut milk? I've had better elsewhere. The Garlic Prawns were SO good! A bit pricey compared to the other dishes but the prawns were very big and juicy and were fried to perfection. The seasoning on the prawns was so delicious! The curry was the best I've ever had. The flavors were there and the duck was roasted to the perfect consistency and meshed so well with the curry. Service was great! All the waiters made sure our water glasses were full and always checked up on us. This place is definitely a spot I would need to visit everytime I'm in Vegas. Worth the cab ride from the strip and definitely worth the hype! :)"

First let me rave about the duck Panang curry( KHAO SOI) My mouth is watering just thinking about the crispy duck breast with the rich 6/10 spicy Panang curry. It's rich, creamy, and the spice just create a symphony in your mouth. The curry itself is just perfect alone and the duck makes it 100x better! I mean renowned chefs like Ming Tsai and Anthony Bourdain say it's perfection, then best believe it's perfection as its finest. Now let's continue with the crispy garlic shrimp. Its cooked properly, crispy on the outside, and sweet and juicy in the inside like how a perfect shrimp should be. Order the KHAO SOI and drizzle that sauce in the crispy shrimp with some rice that comes with the KHAO SOI and you will be in food heaven. Next is there handmade issan sausage, I wasn't really a fan of it. I found it a bit salty to my liking but it's one of the famous dishes to order. The drunken soft shell noodle was nothing that special as well as their pad Thai. Moving to dessert! I would love to mention how great their coconut ice cream is! I haven't found another place that captured the integrity of the coconut floral yet delicate flavor. Dessert is a must!!! YES THE PLACE IS OFF THE STRIP BUT DONT LET THAT BE THE REASON YOU DON'T GO! ITS THAT GREAT! ITS A MUST, KHAO SOI ftw!!!"

We had enough time to go back to our room, change, come back to the restaurant, and still wait long enough to be pretty hungry by the time we were seated. \n\n2. I got food poisoning. While we shared all of our dishes, one of them had individual soft shell crabs, which was the majority of what I puked out later in the evening. I've since read about other food poisoning reports here, particularly connected to seafood, so I think there must be a problem. It left me sick for a full 24 hours, and worse, my immune system was so down from the dehydration and the dry winter weather in Vegas, this was followed by a cold that lasted several more days. \n\nAs terrible as my illness was, I had a very tasty dinner before the aftermath, which makes it hard to write Lotus off completely:\n\nRed curry - amazing\nFried spicy catfish - solid\nDrunken noodle soft shell crab - good noodles, bad crabs\nFried banana w/coconut ice cream and sticky rice - good but a bit too sweet\nThai iced tea - standard"

I don't care how (in)authentic an appetizer it is, as long as it screams CRASH BANG BOOM in my mouth, that's all that really matters. \n\nAnd then there's the vegetable dish complete with various stir fried vegetables that seems as though they've been sitting in a vat of chili oil for years. They're spicy, juicy and perfect. The pepper seeds through the dish let you know that this is a Thai serious dish and you better damn well order sticky rice to offset some of that fire ferocity. \n\nLotus. A flow.

I love the crab fried rice at OSHA Thai cafe on Geary Blvd in S.F. and ever since then, I have been ordering crab fried rice in every Thai restaurant that has the dish on their menu.  I hadn't found one that came close to OSHA's until Lotus of Siam.  It's better than OSHA!  Wow!  I never thought I'd be saying that.  Anyway, also had their papaya salad which was good, but we made the mistake of asking for 6 on their scale of 1-10 for spiciness.  The waiter said 4 was what most people ordered.  Well, I thought. I could handle spicy more than most people... well, I was dead wrong.  It was damn spicy!  So if you go here and they ask you for the scale... order 4!  Otherwise it's way too spicy.  I don't know if it was able to take less spicy this time because of the heat in Vegas... not sure if that had something to do with it.  But it was damn spicy.  Their deep fried pompano fish was pretty tasty as well.  Their sticky rice with mango was also very tasty.  The mango was very good.  \n\nSo I give it 4 stars because of their decor.  They could do so much more with the place.  It was very plain and ordinary.  I guess I've become used to Thai restaurants having more of a Thai decor and having more of a warm feeling while dining in the restaurants."

In Fall 2011, Mr R and I set out to try all three.  We lovingly referred to it as our Thai Trifecta, or Thai-fecta, if you will. \n\nWe completed the Thai-fecta in December by visiting Lotus of Siam. \n\nThe place is huge but cleaner and nicer than its strip mall implies. We arrived on a Saturday night at about 8:45 and we were seated after a 5 minute wait.\n\nWe had already studied the menu and knew what we'd order:\n\nNam Kao Tod - it was exactly as I imagined, but still not my favorite dish.  The lime in some Thai foods is not my favorite and this was a spicy, crunchy rice (not like fried rice, but more like a rice krispie) with sour sausage, onions, spice...and lots of lime.  It was pretty spicy so I ate it with cucumbers.\n\nSpicy Drunken Noodles with Prawns - I love drunken noodles and these were pretty good. The prawns were huge and meaty - they still had the shells and little baby legs on them.  I confirmed a few times, \"we eat the shell, right?\" and they said yes. So I did. I could manage the shell but the legs freaked me out a bit.\n\nNam Prick Ong - Mr R loved this and I liked it a lot. Its spicy ground pork with red chiles that you scoop onto vegetables, pork rinds, or sticky rice.  We ordered the sticky rice just to keep our options open, but I really enjoyed it with the carrots and pork rinds. The rice made it more filling and wasn't necessary.  \n\nOverall, Lotus of Siam was good and we'd come back.  \n\nThe entire Thai-fecta was an interesting exercise and while these are three great restaurants known for overall great food and a couple of really unique or famous dishes - I still love my local favorite Thai places."

Be sure to ask for the Northern menu, which has many good choices as well.\n* I had Nam Kao Tod (minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanut, and lots of crispy rice); charbroiled catfish; sticky rice with mango.  It was a lot of food, and everything was very good.\n* The food tends to be very, very hot.  Fortunately, you get to specify how spicy you want things.  Your waiter will ask you how hot you want your food on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is the hottest.  I ordered level 3 to be safe, and it was still pretty hot.\n* The address is on Sahara Avenue.  However, that's the BACK of the restaurant.  Don't run away in horror; instead, drive around to the other side.  It turns out to be a shopping mall, with the entrance to Lotus of Siam.  Once you get inside, you won't be much more impressed with the decor.  Don't worry - it's a good restaurant!"

Somehow their quality has gone down.......probably they have become complacent. It is a pity to see a good restaurant drop so much in quality. Let me more specific....their starters i.e. Tom Yum soup was just spicy without the flavors. When we reordered they made it so bland that it was difficult to finish it. I patiently went ahead with the order for main dish hoping that the starter was an anomaly and each and every dish was below to just around average.  \n\nThe service is absolutely atrocious. They gave me an estimate of the  wait of 1.5 hrs, and then suddenly they texted within 30 minutes that the table is waiting. Then within 10 minutes of the  text they cancelled my place in the line. I managed to get back and wish my place in line was really taken. The main dish took almost 1 hr and that too when we had to remind the server at least 3 times. The whole sub-par meal with horrible service including  the co-ordination took me about 3 hrs . And this is when we had so many other options in Vegas. What a waste. For average to below average food, a stip mall location, it is just not worth it. \n\nhence the 1 star."

This, like the prawns, was suggested to me by our waiter, and I'm so glad I went with his recommendations.\n\nLast but not least - the wine.  We had a delicious reisling (surprise, surprise - recommended by the waiter).  It was so good that we took the bottle with us to a nearby liquor store to buy some more."

However when you walk in its ten times nicer. Staff was good. But overall the food just wasn't that great, especially for the price. I had two of the most commonly raved about dishes. The drunken noodles with soft shell crap and the crispy duck in curry. Both were less than awesome. I did have the tom kah which was pretty good. But overall the food just felt...greasy. And not all that tasty. Blah! I just feel like I've had so much better thai food in Los Angeles for half the price. I'd save your money, or order one of the lesser expensive dishes."

We started with crispy rice that was so well balanced I am almost afraid to go home and cook again because I know I will never get to this kind of balanced flavor in any meal. For dinner we shared pad thai, short rib panang curry, and crispy garlic prawns. Everything that we had was better than the last. On a whim before we left we ordered some sticky rice that made the meal even better when I really thought that was not possible. I have dined at joel rubichon, Estatiario Milos, Nobu, and the list goes on of Vegas spots you cannot miss that I have not missed. This one topped them all, and for a bill of under 100 for three including drinks and dessert. I cannot wait to come back!"

We had the crispy duck w/ greens, sea bass w/ drunken noodle, garlic shrimp, and mango & sticky rice. All which were extremely good I just couldn't get over the fact that those 4 dishes came out to be over $100 w/ tip. Not a big deal since we won enough money to pay for all 5 days meals & entertainment but DAMN! Was it worth it?? Yes but it definitely teetered near the edge of ridiculously overpriced, considering it wasn't on the strip in a fancy casino property (just carried the premium).\n\nWell anyways, I'm glad we came since it was always on our \"to-eat-at\" list for Vegas. Maybe next time we'll try Kabol or Archies for Thai. I would come back to Lotus of Siam but probably with more people. Also, their wine list & glass enclosed racks were impressive. Something you'd rarely see in an Asian restaurant. I'd like to think my meal helped pay for that!"

The chili sauce it comes with paired well. The garlic prawns were good and crispy (nice texture), I think they're known for their shrimps mostly. The papaya salad (my favorite Thai dish) was disappointing. The flavor was not what I was used to and there was so much sauce which made it liquidly. The coconut tom yum with chicken was good.

I didn't see it on the menu, but luckily I was able to pull up another review photo. It was delicious! \n4. Drunken noodles - If I can't remember the meat in it, does that tell you anything? This is why I went in the 1st place. Noodles were stuck together, may order one more time to see if it was just the cook.\n5. Chicken pad Thai - Flavor was good, but noodles were smaller than most Thai places I have visited.\n6. Stuffed chicken wings - OMG!! I could have eaten 4 of these as a meal. My jaw dropped when I saw bill and realize we paid $11.95 for 2. But I think I will actually order this baby again!\n7. Fried Bananas and ice cream - Actually it didn't come together, they charged us separately for it.... Come on now!! \n\nAll in all, we spent $160 total, with 2 beers and 1 wine.

Being my first time here I had a hard time deciding what to order, but going by other Yelper's reviews, I ordered:\n\n- Nam Kao Tod (Appetizer): Selected 4 out of the 10 spiciness levels, seemed to be about right for me, but be wary, I saw some other tables sweating and downing drinks when they got too much spice.\n- Tom Kah Kai (Soup): Delicious, it has coconut milk on it which gives it a unique flavor, definitely worth a try.\n- Drunken Noodle Chicken & Pork Pad Se-Ew (Entrees): The noodles in both of this, out of this world. I personally likeD the Pork Pad Se-Ew better but they were both really good.\n- Nam Prik Ong (Red chilli dip): Never had it before, interesting to try, but wouldn't put it on top of my list.\n- Coconut ice cream with fried banana: I was so full I wasn't going to get dessert but other people were recommending it. It's definitely tasty, but I would rather save space for trying more dishes.\n\nAll in all, the food was absolutely amazing and this is what this place is all about. Kudos for them.

Instead of the nice lean slices of brisket that you use to get, now you get about three slices of brisket (no longer cooked with sauce on it) on top of shredded brisket full of fat which looks like it was long on the bottom of the pot.  Definitely not worth the money you pay for it.  I did confirm with the management that the menu has been changed to the unsavory item mentioned above.  What use to be a great dish and well worth the money, is now a glob of fatty shredded tiny pieces of brisket taken from the bottom of the pot with a few pieces of brisket on top, no longer cooked with the delicious sauce that use to give it such a good flavor, and no longer worth the money.\n\nSo disappointed.

We ordered a recommended beef salad, the Tom klong soup (similar to Tom yum Kai but recommended by our waitress), Padang chicken, yellow Curry chicken, chop suey and the highly recommended garlic prawns.\n\nWell...  I have had Thai in many places and unfortunately this experience was not up there.  The recommended beef salad had a thick sauce, reminded me of Chinese style dish.  Not that good.  The soup was good and so was the chop suey (which also seemed more Chinese than Thai).  Nothing wrong but we were expecting more Thai cuisine.  The panang was ok.  The yellow curry was good. And the garlic prawns were nice, but as someone else noted the portion was small in comparison to the price.\n\nIn conclusion, we left the place wondering why it was rated 4 stars.

The best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas is at Lotus of Siam and it's only a 7 min drive from the strip off Sahara. Best make reservations if you have parties of 4 or more since this place always has a wait.\n\nHere are a few musts from the menu:\n\n1) Thai iced tea\n2) Garlic Prawns (they fry them season them and still keep the skin on...must have)\n3) Duck curry (spicy levels from 1-10, we had the 8 and it was pretty spicy...so stick with 5-6 for those who just want a medium kick)\n\nStaff's very attentive and supposedly they have a great wine selection, but I have yet to try anything. I always make a pit stop anytime I come back to Las Vegas...I found a gold mine."

Last night we went with a group of 8 and the service was just as great as my first visit. My boyfriend and I shared the crispy duck with drunken noodles and also the beef larb. Both dishes were just amazing and cooked to perfection. However, last time I ordered spiciness with a 3 and it was a tad bit too spicy, so this time I ordered with a 2 and there was no spice at all, lol. I think it's just a Thai thing and it depends on who's cooking that day. Either way, the food was excellent!"

I came here with a party of 9 and we had to wait about 40 minutes until we were seated. We had some time to look through the menu and figure out what we wanted to eat. Let's just say that we ordered the entire menu! Everything we ordered was really good except for maybe 2 dishes that I could have done without. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Som Thum Papaya Salad: loved it!\n- Tom Ka Kai (soup): Coconut milk with chicken and mushrooms. I could have done without this. There wasn't anything special about it. It was really really sour. I would much rather prefer the Tom Yum Soup\n\nEntrees:\n- Garlic Prawns\n- Pad Thai\n- Drunken noodle seafood\n- Pineapple fried rice- Didn't have as much flavor as I expected =(\n- Crab fried rice\n- Chicken Red Curry\n- Braised short ribs with panang- Amazing!! My favorite dish from here!\n- Sea bass on drunken noodle\n- Crispy duck w/ chili mint leaves\n\nWe ordered more but I can't seem to remember them all. This is a place you must try when you go to Vegas. Oh and the Thai Tea is good too!"

Our first stop in Vegas was Lotus of Siam. The place is alot bigger inside and it can seat ALOT of people. We order a round of Singha and sake and then order 4-5 dishes. All of the dishes was good but nothing shinning or the best Thai food ever. I like their pad mee and they do put nice things like soft shell crab on certain dishes. Sadly I think this is a AVERAGE restaurant with AVERAGE food. There a lot better Thai food in Hollywood then here but guess if you think of average white people or people around US then most people would think this is the best. Yes i just say that!!"

What we thought was going to be a tiny place was huge, and filled with people of all ages and ethnicities grubbing down in large groups and couples.  It was crazy.  All the locals must have agreed to place this off the beaten trail, wrap it camouflage, and make it look inhabitable so tourists would stay away.\n\nThe War Wonton Soup is the best I've ever had. My mouth just filled up with juice as I wrote that.  You don't even need soy sauce.  The garlic flavor is so damn good.\n\nI can't recall all of the names of our plates, but we had duck, pork, pot stickers, and yellow curry chicken, all of which were killer.\n\nThey say american spice is a 5 so we tried that and it was just right.  10 is the highest, but being new to this restaurant, we didn't want to chance anything higher.

Still, it sits in an easily overlooked and unassuming strip mall away from The Strip. The walls are adorned with famous celebrities as former patrons. There's still a wait, although much of that may be to create the illusion of a packed dining room (it's not). We waited about an hour for a table for six, although the table had been empty the entire time. \n\nThe menu itself is huge and includes dishes from Northern Thailand not found in your average Thai restaurant. Based on prior reviews, we ordered the nam kao tod and the sea bass drunken noodles. We added on some typical Thai plates such as pineapple fried rice, pad see ew, and the spicy garlic chicken wings. The nam kao tod beef was good, but inconsistent. Some of the pieces were perfect, while others were more tough and dry. The must-try dish of the night was the sea bass. The fish was perfectly fried, but the drunken noodles left much to be desired. The pineapple fried rice was and pad see ew were average. \n\nWe finished with a mango sticky rice for dessert, which was amazing. The mangos were as sweet as can be and the sticky rice was topped with just the right amount of lavender to give it a floral aroma with every bite. Overall, the sea bass was a bit pricey and the other dishes were okay, but it was a good meal, albeit pricey for Thai. I have to return to try the garlic prawns. Come with a group of friends (but come early) so you can try as many of the 150 dishes as possible."

I hate the places where you make a reservation, but still have to wait like everybody else.\n\nWe got the spicy catfish with basil, crispy duck in panang sauce, Tod Mun Pla (deep fried fish-cak), and Tom Yum Kun soup.  We got everything medium, oh also, everything came in exactly as medium for me, its not one of those places where medium means, low to zero spicy.\n\nThe Tod Mun Pla was great, I love the spicy sauce with cucumbers that came with it.\nTom Yum Kun soup was good, but was actually a little spicy for me.\nThe spicy fried catfish was real tasty and it stayed crispy till the end, I was expecting it to get soggy later on in the meal, but it stayed crispy.  \nThe crispy duck was also great, the only part of the duck that was crispy though was the skin.  It came with a panang sauce, which was good, we put that over our rice.  The duck was a little pricey though, about $21, was expecting it to be a whole duck, but was probably only half a duck.  But was still worth getting it.\n\nOverall, if I am in Vegas and feeling like eating Thai, I would come here."

Fry masters are working in the kitchen.\n\nThai Spaghetti ($11.95): It's the sauce and noodles that will win you over. It had that slightly sweet flavor, similar to pad thai. The noodles were served al dente, which was perfect. It had that chew texture that I absolutely love for noodles. \n\nBanana Roll ($8.50): Highly recommended with coconut ice cream (additional $4). I'm not the biggest coconut fan, but loved their ice cream. I need to know where they get it! The banana roll portion was generous even for a party of 6 like ours. Banana lovers will not be disappointed. \n\nWe got a few other dishes, including their Thai Fried Rice with Chicken ($10.95), Tom Kah Kai Hot Pot Soup ($14.95), and Stuffed Chicken Wings ($11.95). They were all good, but the dishes I mentioned above were noteworthy! \n\nStopping at Lotus of Siam will truly be a treat for your tastebuds. Food is AMAZING. It has officially made it to my #1 spot for Thai food. Service was fast and efficient from the moment you're sat. Prices are steep, but they really know how to cook up amazing food. Best way to go about it is family style so you can sample a little of everything. \n\nReservations are taken but should be made AT LEAST a week in advance. A couple in front of us had reservations and got seated immediately. Note taken. The wait was worth it, but I can't see myself doing it again. BE SMART AND MAKE A RESERVATION!!"

I love spicy food and this was not spicy however I should have expected that. The food came out pretty quickly. The shrimp was very tender and served with peppers and onions. Overall the dish had great flavor! They have a huge menu with a large variety of Thai food to order from. They even have a Northern dish section which has very distinct flavors. My mom ordered the Khao Soi which is a curry dish with egg noodles and veggies. It was so full of flavor and one of the best Thai dishes I've ever tasted. The curry was so good that she ate it like a soup and finished the whole thing. It had just the right amount of spice so I would highly recommend it! The explosion of flavors and distinct/unique tastes really sets this Thai food apart from ordinary Thai food places. Not only that but the meat and fish were very good quality and that also really made this a much more exceptional and unordinary Thai restaurant. The meat and fish were just so tinder and fresh. The prices were also very reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity and being that they are in Vegas, they are one of the much cheaper restaurants.  Came here for lunch at about 2:15 (15 minutes before closing time). The waitress warned us that we may not get in because they stop giving out tables at 2:30 so obviously they would rather be done working by 3 than keep serving people. This is probably because they have so many customers that they it won't make a difference if they have one or two extra customers. However it was very apparent that they were ready to leave because the wait staff seemed pretty rushed to have us order and not exceptionally friendly towards us. Also, it was a little off the strip so the location was not very nice and the inside was just okay too. They could definitely use some renovations to make it nicer."

We started with beef satay and as the peanut sauce and beef hit my taste buds it took me right back to Bangkok. Followed up with some fried tofu with an outstanding sweet chilli sauce. The crispy duck in Penang sauce was unbelievable... the truly crunchy outside and soft meat was unexpected. The chilli rating from 1 to 10 was an added plus. I like slightly hot -spicy and a chilli rating of 6 for the Panang chicken was just enough to make it uncomfortably good! Lastly, the mango and sticky rice was perfectly done, ripe mango with warm pudding like, slightly coconut flavored sticky rice. The beauty of Lotus is the subtle seasoning that differentiates the ordinary form the extraordinary. Portions were generous and service was very good. Don't be put off by the strip mall entrance... or the price ($70 with tip for two) as it is really \"Thai\" food."

The food here is creative and exquisite.  Simple things like the Chicken Satay, is transcended.  It had a moist and delicate taste.  One could even skip the peanut sauce on it.  The Chile spicy wings hit on a lot of notes.  It was sweet and savory at the same time.  The skin was crispy and crunchy and the meat was cooked perfectly.  The Garlic Prawns had a lot of crunch and great garlic taste, without overpowering.  It was like eating little lobsters deep fried to heavenly perfection.  The Stuffed chicken was surprising great.  It was moist and tender on the inside, with the crispy Panco crust on the outside.  The combination Fried rice was flavorful and not greasy.  The best has to be their red dip, Nam-Prik-Ong!  It the flavor profile hits on so many notes.  You can't beat pork on pork (use the pork rinds).  it starts off crunchy and salty.  Then it steps up to hit of sweet and savory.  It finishes with a spicy note at the end of the journey.  I HIGHLY recommend.  It is probably one of the best dishes on the menu.\n\nIt is not located in the best area, a bit off the beaten path.  I think that is why it makes it so extraordinary.  One would not think to find such a ray of light in an otherwise shady part of town.

The Tom Yum soup is the white tom yum cooked to perfection with herbs spices and not from a paste from the jar!  The glass noodle , papaya and seafood salad was awesome! Sour spicy salty with lots of veggies and fresh seafood!  Pad Thai and crab meat fried rice was great to take the spicy edge off! Larb and spicy ground beef with basil was fantastic ! \nGreat experience ! Highly recommend"

You can tell the servers make money here and they are all professionals. Secondly the food is amazing, we already know this. We didn't come not knowing the depth of amazingness, we came to sit back and let Lotus of Siam feed us till we couldn't eat anymore. \n\nWe started with the ubiquitous chicken satay, which was by far the most authentic and best chicken satay I've ever had. The chicken almost seemed charcoal grilled and the peanut sauce was fresh and spot on. \n\nSecondly we had the Som Tum papaya salad which was excellent! Hotter than napalm but excellent nonetheless. I should of ordered sticky rice with it, my bad. \n\nNote: I ordered everything level 5 spicy out of 10 because my wife likes hot but not super hot. I must say the 5 here is an easy 7 or 8 at an American Thai restaurant. The papaya salad was easily an 8, I loved it but it was too hot for the wifey.\n\nNext we had the Nam Tok (like a larb but instead of ground meet its with grilled beef). The Nam Tok's flavor was spot on. That lime juice, roasted rice powder, mint, cilantro, onion, shallot, and chili flavor I love. The only downside was the meat was very fatty which i didn't love.\n\nLastly we had the Chicken fried rice with Spicy Basil sauce. Best fried rice I've ever had. Hot as heck but excellent flavor and quality cuts of chicken. \n\nLotus of Siam, some would say the best Thai food in America, is classy, yummy, spicy, and not cheap. But what really high quality food these days is really cheap anymore? I can't wait to come back!"

            "review": "If you've never been to Lotus of Siam the initial impression is extraordinarily underwhelming. Lotus is located in an unassuming strip mall north of the strip a stone's throw from the SLS Hotel. Not only is the exterior somewhat dilapidated but the surrounding establishments are a bit questionable. Affordable Dental? The Foot Lounge? All that doubt fades away as you enter the restaurant, which is lively- filled with people of all walks of life amidst an undeniable waft of Thai chilies and spices. I must admit service was a bit lacking at first. From the hostess that walked us in to the waiter who took our drink order, there didn't seem to be much effort put into being attentive. But this didn't really bother me considering the sheer number of guests the restaurant was trying to attend to. Our waiter, on the other hand, was extremely friendly and helpful in choosing menu items that would suit our liking.\n\nI decided to try their Thai Lime Drink that was made in house. The drink came to the table cloudy and mint blue in color. My immediate reaction was it was extremely crisp and refreshing. It wasn't too sweet with just enough zest for a puckering sensation. It was light, which paired well with the heavy flavors of Thai cuisine. \n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I ordered the Khao Soi: crispy duck over egg noodles with Northern Thai curry and wonton crisps. I ordered mine mild but traditionally it is eaten much spicier. Because the curry was light in spice the coconut milk had a very obvious presence. The curry itself was a bit watery unlike the thick Thai curries that I was used to. The egg noodles were mid-sized in width, cooked perfectly and paired well with the curry in that it wouldn't absorb too much of the flavor. The noodles were thin with a nice bite to them. I've noticed that the flavor of the protein in Thai curries usually takes a backseat and the textures of the meat are much more prominent. This dish was no different in that the duck had fantastic texture: it was cut in thick strips and the skin providing a satisfying crunch. Every couple of bites I would get a sprig of cilantro, which would cut the heaviness of the sauce or a wonton crisp with green onion that would add to the contrast of textures. \n\nOverall, I had a memorable experience at Lotus and it only further ascertained that I have a fervent passion for Thai cuisine."

The skin is still incredibly crispy and the fattiness cuts out the spiciness of the curry very well.  MUST GET.\n\nThe garlic prawns: basically tiger prawns half de-shelled so that their bodies are chilling outside of the shell but still wearing them like a cape. Then they are deep fried and tossed in garlic and white pepper. The shell was the best part! So crispy, salty, slightly spicy, and not the least bit oily. It was just endless crunchfuls of deliciousness. MUST GET. These fried shells are better than chips. Better than fried pork skins. Better than any crunchy savory combo item you can ever dream of. GET THESE. They are expensive.\n\nThe coconut ice cream was very interesting. Order it. Creamy yet refreshing, it had a flavor almost similar to taro.\n\nOther stuff were whatever. The portions here are small.

However, this place didn't tickle my taste bud or even satisfy my Thai food craving.\n\nFound this place on yelp and wanted to try this place since it has 4-stars and over 1200 reviews.  I thought to myself...wow this place must be authentic and good.\n\nGot there at about 5:15pm (they open at 5:30pm for dinner) after reading some reviews saying that this place has a long wait and I didn't want to wait in line.  There were a few people waiting in line already and more people came after we got in line.  \n\nThe place is fairly big and has a pretty impressive wine cellar... but sorry to say that was the one thing that was impressive.  They also had a big staff if waiters/waitress waiting to serve you.  We got seated and the place filled up pretty quickly.\n\nSo when you walk into an Asian restaurant and see that 90% of the customers there were American...what would you think?  Not trying to offend anyone, but I think this place is catered to the American's taste buds.\n\nFood we tried:\n\nThai Ice Tea - Pretty good smooth tea but it was a little on the sweeter side.  \n\nSpicy Chicken Wings - I think this should be called sweet and sour chicken wings instead.  This dish was okay and was very saucy and sweet...not spicy at all (it looks like it has sweet and sour sauce on it).\n\nNau Dad Deaw (Beef Jerky) - As you can say... beef jerky...its pretty tough and not as flavorful...\n\nSom Thum (Papaya Salad) - Very toned down.  I mean very very toned down and bland.  They papaya was coarsely cut and is not the thinly strands as you see in other papaya salad.  Not authentic at all.\n\nCrispy Duck Panang Curry - This is probably the best food dish of all that we ordered.  Still not as tasty as the ones I've had back in NorCal. Again, this dish is also tone down.\n\nSea Bass Drunken Noodles - How can you go wrong with a noodle dish??? but somehow they manage to make it bad.  The taste of it was bland and the noodles were hard.  I guess the noodles are probably old.  The sea bass was deep fried and was decent in taste. \n\nMango Sticky Rice Dessert - I would say this is the best tasting dish of our meal.  Come on.. how can you go wrong with mango and sticky rice right.  I love mangoes so this dish is definitely yummy to me.\n\nI would have to say we did over order for the two of us, but because of the reviews I read, I wanted to try different items.  The portions are smaller than other Thai restaurants and the prices are a bit marked up.  With all the dishes we ordered, we thought our check will come out to about $70, but I was wrong...our bill was almost $100.  We could of gone somewhere else and have better tasting food with the amount we paid.  Pretty disappointed in this place."

There are no \"lunch specials\" but there is a $10.99 lunch buffet.  I guess it can't be vegas without a buffet?\n\nI know that you don't exactly go to a Thai restaurant for chicken wings, but the garlic black pepper chicken wings caught my eye and I just couldn't let it go.  So chicken wings it is.\n\ncouldn't do it alone - so got some chicken dumplings as well with some steamed rice.  My bestie who joined me in town for Yelp Spring Break got the Yellow Curry so we did some sharing.\n\nCurry was decent, but I felt that the veggies weren't really cooked enough.  I kinda felt like they just threw it in in the last 2 minutes to warm them and that was it.  Not that I was expecting mush, but a little bit more cooked perhaps?\n\nChicken dumplings were fried, nothing special, I'm sure I've gotten those before in the freezer section at the grocery store.\n\nBut the wings deserve 5 stars on their own.  They were so GOOD.  there was some sweetness to them, but the garlic and pepper were fantastic with the wings.  They were cooked (fried) to perfection and still moist enough on the inside.  Absolutely loved the flavor profile.  Go figure the truly non tradition item was the thing I thought was the best.  I'd go back for the wings, but don't know if I'd be willing to get other things...besides, the wings were like 9 bucks on their own for 6, which is a bit steep when you think about it.\n\nService was quite good, but be forewarned, if you are there with a large group, they can only split it four ways, so be a good customer and bring cash if you've got a large group, not a pile of debit cards.\n\nParking you ask?  This is not on the strip, it's free and there is PLENTY at all times."

Believe me, I had plenty of Thai food in NorCal, SoCal and NY.  \n\nUpon checking out all the Yelp reviews, we decided that we need to get the best three dishes.  Between the two of us, we could only stuff ourselves so much.  LOL.   The three winners were (and they truly were!) the garlic shrimp, crispy duck kang soi and soft shell crab drunken noodles.\n\nDid we make the best choice!  The magnificently jumbo prawns were delicious.  I couldn't decide if I like the shrimp itself more or the fried shrimp shell!   Yes, you can and should and need to eat the shell entirely which is fried separately from the shrimp meat.  That was my fave of the three incredible dishes.\n\nThe drunken noodles with the soft shell crab were delightfully cooked.  The crab is fresh and lightly battered.  The noodles are moist but not oily.  We can eat pretty darn spicy but decided to go with only 6/10 and it was perfect.  It was a bit spicy in the mouth without taking out the true flavor of the dish.\n\nThe last but certainly not the least dish was the duck kang soi.  The noodles below the crispy duck were soaked with the fat of the duck and the creamy yet light broth.  There were fried noodles on the side.  The combo of the three (duck, broth and noodles) gave it a nice complexity.\n\nThe prices are a bit steep and the total came out to be about $86.  But when you think about it, it is a very fair price to pay for the best Thai food I had in U.S.!"

They come in many varieties too...a friend had the duck while on another visit, I opted for the soft shell crab drunken noodles. I'm craving for it now as I am typing this!\n\nThe crispy rice appetizer is a must try...such a unique dish with a spicy-sour kick to it. It's really unlike anything I've ever eaten! I'm also a big fan of the Thai beef salad...the cuts of beef they use are so tender and of good quality. \n\nFor dessert, of course you need to get the sticky rice with mango + a side of coconut ice cream. Heavenly. \n\nStaff is courteous, attentive, and efficient. They gladly offer to call cabs for their patrons so you can be right on your way once you're done eating."

Looks so dinky from the outside, so I was so surprised to see how bustling and large it was on the inside. \n\nWait time can be around 2 hours, so try to come on an off time or near closing. We came around 9:30, when their last seating is at 10, and were seated right away. I called at 8 the same day, and the wait time was 1.5 hours. \n\nIt's known by celebrity chefs as \"the best Thai restaurant in America.\" Their menu is extensive, it probably has at least 100 items of main courses. I love that they include northern Thai dishes, such as Khao Soi, which is so difficult to find near me. So don't get Pad Thai here -- try something new!\n\nThe 2 dishes people rave about here are their Crispy Garlic Prawns and the Crispy Duck Panang Curry. These were under \"Chef's Choice,\" and cost around $30. Pricy. Everything else was a more reasonable $10ish. \n\nI would not order the prawns again. They're basically just really crispy prawns, and I'm not sure what the hype around it is. \n\nThe crispy duck, on the other hand, is the best duck I've ever had. And being an Asian American, I've had my fair share of duck. Crispy skin, moist meat. How do they do it?? Even Anthony Bourdain (or was it Andrew Zimmerman??) was in awe of how they cooked it. He said something along the lines of \"2 top chefs with over 50 years of experience between them can't figure it out.\" \n\nI was sharing the crispy duck dish with my boyfriend, and sometimes we will fight over the good pieces (jokingly, of course). This time, I intentionally chose the worst piece just to see... and it was STILL AMAZING. \n\nI will DEFINITELY be back to try the other dishes! I wish I had the stomach to try more!! Or I wish I didn't order the prawns, so I could try 3 other plates.....lol regrets"

The amount in the plate is fairly small compared to all the pad thai's we've had so I was disappointed.  The sauce and noodle ratio was off because there was too much sauce.  Despite this, we liked the pad Thai.\n\nShrimp Fried Rice: again, very small amount. We had to order two more sides of white rice (there was only two of us).\n\nPad Prik King: it was spicy and that was about it. I honestly don't remember the taste because it didn't make an impact on my taste buds.  There was nothing remarkable about this dish.  Won't be ordering this again.\n\nYellow Curry:  I LOVE YELLOW CURRY.  But this was probably the worst yellow curry I've ever tasted.  Not because it was disgusting, but because the chicken had no taste.  The soup part of the curry was good but once I bit into the chicken, there was no taste.  Absolutely disappointing.\n\nOverall, since we rarely come to Vegas, we probably will never be back to this place again the next time we vacation because there are so many other restaurants in Vegas.  The food in this place was a miss on our first visit so we will try other restaurants."

The spice level would definitely go up next time. It has just the right hint of hot and sour. Next we got the pad thai which totally blew me away. Pad thai is something I always need to get at a Thai restaurant to compare and this dish surprised me with how good it tasted. The papaya salad was good, but nothing really special. Garlic prawns were huge and crispy and I could taste the slightest hint of garlic! I hate it when food items claim they have garlic in it but you can't taste it for shit. Next we got the drunken noodles w/ soft shell crabs. MMMMMM, so gooood! Crabs was good and drunken noodles had the right amount of flavors. Last, we went with the mango sticky rice.

Here you will find two gay bathhouses (a.k.a. spa/health clubs), two wig shops, one 420 cafe, several evangelical and pentecostal churches, a roller hockey rink, a reggae club, a BDSM supplies/goth clothing store, an Alcoholics Together meeting space, and numerous Asian restaurants/clubs, all seemingly harmoniously coexisting.\n\nI had high hopes for LoS after reading the foodie blogs.  We arrived on a Sat night around 7:30p sans reservation and entertained ourselves by walking around the strip mall during our 30 minute wait.  The staff was courteous.  Prices were a bit higher and portions were smaller than you'd find in Thai Town in Hollywood or at LoS's sister restaurant Renu Nakorn (Norwalk, CA).  We ordered two Issan specialties, kang hoh and nam kao tod (medium spicy), in addition to mango sticky rice and Thai iced coffee.  The kang hoh was less vinegary than Renu Nakorn's (a good thing), but contained something resembling overcooked beef stew meat, not pork as listed on the menu.  The nam kao tod was likewise somewhat disappointing - heavy on the rice with small cubes of purchased sausage.  Maybe I'm used to the nam kao tod at Khun Dom (Hollywood, CA), but I prefer it heavy on the fresh ginger and prepared with seasoned ground pork and pork skin with the rice as more of a topping.  Neither dish was in the least bit spicy and appeared on the table too fast to be prepared freshly upon our order.  The food seemed sadly farangified."

The impressive, reasonably priced wine selection would put a Cheshire grin on the portly mug of Bacchus himself.\n\nJonathan Gold - food writer/ LA Times, said Lotus of Siam \"is the best Thai restaurant  in North America\".  I concur wholeheartedly.  Chef/Owner, Saipin Chutima implements the finest quality ingredients and melds flavors reminiscent of my experience of true Thai cuisine.  Chef Chutima opened Renu Nakorn in Norwalk, California although has since sold to family members.    \n\nMy dining group and I were punctual for our dinner reservation (dinner reservations are highly recommended) and were promptly seated in full view of the acclaimed wine cellar collection. \n\nAfter perusing the vast menu and conferring with our waiter we methodically choose  dishes from various regions in Thailand.  We found the Northern region to be the most interesting.  Even with a filled to capacity restaurant our server delivered our food in a timely manner.  \n\nA main staple in Asian cuisine, garlic prawns are deep fried in the shell and served with a pungent sweet-salty garlic sauce. The Soft Shell Crab salad combines fresh chiles, lime and peanuts.  The small crab, with a light and crispy outer shell was tender and moist inside - a crustacean lover's delight .  A popular Northern dish is the Nam Prik Noom - gently roasted sweet green chilies, fresh garlic and tomatoes are pounded to a flavorful pulp in a mortar and served with pieces of crackly pig skins and sticky rice.  We requested Chef kick up the Scoville units for some serious classic Thai chili heat.  The result, HOT and delicious.\n\nAfter enjoying two bottles of crispy white wine and traditional Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert it was time for my satiated dining group to depart Lotus of Siam.  As I waited for our taxi to arrive I visualized future trips to the neglected shopping center where star Chef Saipin Chutima passionately awaits those who savor traditional Thai cuisine."

I ordered the Nam Prik Ong because it was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate, and my bf ordered the Pad Thai. Neither of our dishes were extremely spicy although we had ordered them 10/10 spicy. I enjoyed my dish, it was very flavorful, but honestly, it just tasted like a meat sauce from a pasta dish. Next time, I'm going to order one of the many other great things they have on their menu. \n\nMy bf's pad thai was delicious, and our chicken dumpling appetizer was good too, albeit not Thai food :) We also got a thai iced tea, which I normally find too sweet for my liking. This was definitely on the sweet side, but I still managed to finish the whole thing. \n\nI'm looking forward to coming back and maybe trying some of their other meat or curry dishes."

The place smells dirty, as are the bathrooms, with non functioning faucets.  The food is average at best.  The curries are ridiculously bad.  They are not curries, as they are just your selection of protein (chicken, or shrimp, or beef, etc.) quickly cooked in non-curry and then a curry sauce thrown on top.  So thus not curries.  They are curry sauce dishes.  All of our food came out cold.  We were seated in the third dining room (last dining room) and it was just a row of fold out tables lined row by row.  There were broken glass in the front windows with wood or cardboard boarding it up.  Service as fast and careless.  Overall a very lousy experience and extremely mediocre food.  Definitely not worth the effort or leaving the strip.   Don't buy into all the hype."

And, yes, you CAN get many items veganized here: the ala carte menu is a great place to get some veggie and/or tofu combinations, from Pad Prik King to Chili Mint, to green curry (one of my faves!).  Just be sure to tell them no fish sauce and ask about which curry bases are OK. (Sometimes red curry is made w/ shrimp paste).  The spicy vegetable soup is amazing and lives up to it's name! The phrase \"I can't feel my lips anymore, but I can't stop eating this!\" is commonly uttered.  You can actually get a few delicious dessert options here too! Sticky rice w/ mango, coconut ice cream (made w/ coconut milk FTW!), fried bananas.... all delish.\n\nBonus: they have Albarino(!!!!!) and Stone IPA on their drink menu, so I get my choice of two of my favourite bevvy's to complete my meal.  \n\nThey have recently expanded and about doubled their seating capacity, so it's easier than it used to be to get a table too!  I would recommend a reservation on a Fri or Sat.... but if it's packed you can always trot over to Komol for some excellent chow as well.\n\nI will say this though -- I have been vegan about 7 years and don't stray from that.  I also generally try to encourage others to eat in a similar manner.  HOWEVER - when I take meat eaters to Lotus, I pretty much insist that they order off the Northern Thai menu.  Only one item on there doesn't have meat, but the dishes are very rarely found on American Thai menus... So just go for it already! If you're an adventurous eater, you'll probably love it."

I had waited two months to visit as a special occasion for my birthday and I passed up going to Ramsay's Steak House for this!  We moved here 3 months ago from Seattle  where there is an abundance of Asian restaurants so I know good Thai food!!! First, yes it's a little whole in the  wall which I was prepared for from doing my research but REALLY their sign wasn't even illuminated on the building making it difficult to even see the dang place in the dark. Then the hour long wait even though i called promptly when their doors opened that evening to make reservations and was told they where full. Finally seated, I had already chosen my entree by looking at there website and although I wanted to order 12 things I chose a fave of Moo Yang.  Had an appetizer of tempura, I have never had tempura with thick crunchy  batter.....that's not tempura. And it was suppose to be vege and shrimp, there where 4 small pieces of vege and the shrimp had been cut in half all for 10.95.  For such a huge menu was disappointing there wasn't no crab rangoons or fresh rolls on there app menu. My entre of Moo Yang was DRY almost shamefully so! No vege's  just a plate of meat that looked like it was tossed around the plate to make it appear it fllled the plate......... horrible presentation.and when the server offered me sticky rice I anxiously said yes but he failed to tell me he was going to charge me an extra 2.00. My husband had crab fried rice, rice looked like it was FRIED for maybe five seconds, just a plate of steamed rice as far as i was concerned.  Last observation I made no spices on the table!!!! Come on!!!! This place is renowned so being busy doesn't cut it!  There decor was not aesthetically pleasing especially the numerous pictures on the wall above me of chef and various clients in cheap frames and hanging crooked on the wall.

Being a Thai who is also proficient with Chinese, Japanese, French, and Italian cuisine, I fail to see why this restaurant receives such rave reviews. We order 3 starters and 6 main dishes. Only the following met my expections: Isaan sausage, roast duck curry, and the starter Crispy noodle. The taste was authentic. Everything else was for people who do not know real Thai food. for example, you cannot cook a catfish with Thai holly basil without the holly basil. It is truly a shame. The Pork sate has no resemblance to what the real pork sate is in all over Thailand.\nThe Isaan soup without any of the Isaan herbs can never be accepted. The Northen pork curry did not taste like anything I had in Northen Thailand. Very unfortunate. On the plus side, the service from the wine stewardess and the food servers were very efficient. We bought a good bottle of red, ordered a bottle of German white and they waived the $25 corkage fee, which is very nice. Not sure what to recommend on Thai restaurants in Vegas. Based on my personal experience, there are extremely few Real Thai restaurants in the country. Look for a place with the majority of clientele being Asians/Thai.

Same day reservations are kinda hard to get....but worth a try.\nMy In-Laws accompanied my wife and me for dinner here. We had our reservation at 8:00 and walked in at 7:55 PM and were seated right away. The service was quick and the server gave us a quick run down on the popular dishes. \nWe had the crispy duck with noodles which was heavenly. We also had the sausage, red chilli dip and the garlic shrimp. The shrimp seemed a tad expensive but it was so decadent....the red chilli dip was spicy and had a nice flavor. The sausage was slightly sour, spicy and did not seem greasy at all.\nIf you like spicy/hot food....order a 8/10. If you are weak minded and adventure is not your thing....6 should get you there!"

It's located in a plaza that hosts an interesting colony of Asian restaurants. Lunch time was busy (wait wasn't bad), service was good, price average. A lot of the customers seemed to have come from the conventions or business people on lunch breaks. We ordered tom yum goong, green curry with beef, chicken satay, and a seafood salad. Everything was intense in flavour--sour, spicy, sweet, salty. The food was decent, but I have definitely been spoiled by reading the reviews granting 5-stars, or by living in LA. I would come back again to try out other dishes."

With my own reputation on the line, I have to take out 2 stars from before as I was truly unsatisfied from the meal.\n\nSince we did the lunch buffet last time and afterwards we read it's best to actually order off the menu at Lotus of Siam, my buddies and I ended up doing just that at dinner this past weekend.  None of us were wowed with the dinner and would just give it 3 stars at most for the dinner. After thinking about it even more, this place to me don't even deserve 3 stars.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n1) Thai Iced Tea: Something that really can't be F-ed up, and it's pretty good here.  Nothing to complain about.\n\n2) Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice: The fried rice had a strong curry taste, but lacked ingredients.  The portion was small, and had yes, the plate had 2 friggin shrimps and pineapples out of a can.  For $8, I expected more.\n\n3) Pad Thai: As the menu said \"It could have been one of the most popular Thai dishes of all time.\" Clearly a mistake since they probably meant to say \"It could be one of the most.....\" Anyways, usually I like pad thai at any Thai restaurant and the one done here is eh...so-so.  My friend was looking for the bean sprouts, it's like WTF happened to it?? Again, the portion was pretty dang small for something that cost $8\n\n4) Spicy Catfish: Very bland and not that spicy. The fish didn't taste that fresh and I was probably the biggest fan of the dish amongst us at the table. Definitely a bad choice on our part, but hey, could that be the case with all the stuff we got?\n\n5) Chicken curry w/o coconut milk: It wasn't something we got off the curry menu, as this dish was on one of \"Siam's favorites.\"  Definitely, it was not a favorite of our's. The curry was watery, lacked in flavor and ingredients. Seriously, another epic fail in my eyes.\n\n6) Mango with sweet coconut milk sticky rice: Probably the best item we got that night. At $7.95, it wasn't cheap, but hey, nothing was really \"cheap\" here other than the fact we got a lot of bad food. I'll give credit when it's due. The mango was fresh and I liked the toasted rice on the sweet coconut milk flavored rice. Too bad we had to get 2 orders of this item since again, very skimping on the portions for the price.\n\nSeriously, over the course of the meal, I had this WTF look as I was eating. For what we paid and all the reviews of the place, I expected a lot more. Definitely more than what I had at the buffet a few months back. Maybe I'm used to LA's Thai Town or Siam I Am in Redondo's prices, but seriously, nothing was of any good value here. I know it's Vegas, but come on, it's located in this ghetto Asian strip mall. Pfft... Will I come back here again? Hell no. I could find better food eating at the Bellagio Buffet w/o leaving the strip. This meal taught me one lesson. I will truly appreciate what I have in Thai Town and the various Thai restaurants I frequent in the South Bay.\n\nLotus of Siam = Epic Fail\n\n*Note* We were hungry enough that we hit up Echiza for the 2nd time in 2 nights. My favorite place to eat in Vegas, by far."

I loved how their desserts weren't too sweet.\n\nOverall, the prices were affordable and the food was very tastey and homey, so it was a better than average Thai restaurant.

The location might not be the best, but the food and service certainly are.  They also have one of the best riesling collections I've ever seen at very reasonable prices.  My favorite starter is the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice mixed with sour sausage, green onions, chilis, ginger, and peanuts.  It's very hard to find on other Thai menus.  I like all the soups, but Tom Kah Kai is my favorite.  All the curries are superb, as are the noodle dishes (especially the drunken noodles with soft shell crab or prawns).  If you haven't tried jack fruit, have one of the northern dishes.  The short ribs with panang is a great dish.  If you have a huge appetite and the chef makes a recommendation, try the whole lobster (I've done it once and will never forget it).  I've lived in Las Vegas for 11 years and have never tired of Lotus.  I've never had a bad meal!"

I remember it being super gray and not interesting but I think they recently renovated it and it is now a more interesting yellow. Parking was no problem and when we went during lunch, there was no wait! The entrance seems small but the restaurant is quite large and very roomy. \n\nGarlic Prawns - amazing! these massive prawns are deep fried and lightly seasoned. You get both the meat and shell. The shell is deep fried to the point of crunchy awesomeness. \n\nCrispy Duck in Panang Curry - one of the best Panang curry in a long time and the best Thai dish I have had in a while. The crispy duck is definitely crispy and the duck pairs really well with the spicy curry. Definitely pour some on top of rice to have a great meal. \n\nSoft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles - delicious! There is so much basil flavor and have plenty of soft shell crab to go around! The signature ingredient is the baked/dried basil that gives it a very unique flavor compared to other Thai restaurants that I have tried. Definitely worth ordering!\n\nThai Tea - a must get if you're ordering spicy food. It tastes fresh and not too sweet. \n\nOverall, this is one of the best Thai places I have ever been to. Their specials are a bit pricey compared to the ones in SD but it is WELL worth it."

It was a mess.\n\nI will give it to Lotus of Siam for having delicious pad thai and one of the best fried rice dishes (the crab fried rice is ridonkulous) I've ever had. The other dishes we ordered were..... interesting. Different styles of sausage, what I believed to be some sort of beef with vegetable dish, and meekrob, definitely new flavors to my palate.

From the outside it looks very small, but don't be fool, the restaurant is way bigger than it looks!\n\nInterior: signs and many awards of the glorious food. And many celebrity photos hung around the walls. Also, they have carpet that is kept super clean! I didn't see one big stain at all! Once you enter you'll see a huge glass window, which they store their wines. Pretty cool I might say. \n\nFood: For the entrees, I got the chicken pad Thai ($10.95) and chicken panang ($12.95) which comes with one bowl of rice. \n\nChicken Pad Thai ($10.95): seriously the best I've ever ate! They don't disappoint. Everything tasted so fresh and they had a good ratio between the noodles, meat, and veggies. Other Thai restaurants they put too much green sprouts in the noodle and/or they put too much eggs or cook the egg weird. They made sure everything tasted perfectly. \n\nChicken panang ($12.95): I was super excited to try this. I got a 3/10 for spice level since I don't like too spicy. I tasted this curry, and it's by far the best curry I ever had. The curry wasn't too thick and it was at an accurate, mild spice. I definitely would get this every time I go there! It's a must have!\n\nFried bananas ($8.50): i was nervous that the fried part of the banana would be overbearing and make me sick but it totally didn't. The fried bananas aren't oily at all. It came out crispy and they added shredded coconut in the fried bananas also. They lightly put powdered sugar and caramel sauce on it. Definitely a great way to end my meal! \n\nThai tea ($2.50): Thai tea at other places are way too sweet but this place didn't make me feel like I was gonna have diabetes. The Thai tea tasted heavenly. The creamer that they put in their Thai tea definitely makes their drink stand out from other restaurants. \n\nService: I made reservations at 7:30pm on a Monday night. We got sat down right when we came inside and once we ordered our food, we received it within 10-15mins! Not a long wait at all! I like how they were smiling and always refilling our waters without us asking them. This restaurant was busy, but they were running things very smoothly. I ended up giving a few more dollars in tips because of their service :]\n\nCons: Entrees are pretty pricey for small portions and I didn't like how they gave us the check right when we got our desserts. I felt very rushed and agitated since there were several people waiting for a table. \n\nOverall, GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE! I love lotus of Siam!!"

Not too long ago, it was one of those hidden finds off the touristy Las Vegas Strip. Thanks to rave reviews from people across the country, as well as attention from the James Beard Foundation, the restaurant is squarely on everyone's radar.\n\nGARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - These were very crunchy and probably a bit overcooked. Surprisingly, I also found them rather bland. I'm curious if perhaps we received the wrong order, as there wasn't really any noticeable black pepper.\n\nSTUFFED CHICKEN WINGS - These wings were better, stuffed with some pork. Really meaty with a nice, light crunch to them. These weren't as moist as I thought they could've been though.\n\nTOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style) - I'm actually not at all familiar with this soup, but it was popular on Yelp. It didn't look like the most appetizing thing, but it was pretty good. There was a little bit of heat here, balanced by some lime juice and the coconut milk. Kind of reminiscent of a Chinese hot & sour soup. Kind of.\n\nCOMBINATION BEEF NOODLE SOUP - My mother was craving some soup noodles, however this was a little too spicy for her. It had a lingering spice that seemed to compound.  The broth had a lot of beefy depth, and I really liked the noodles here. Comforting.\n\nSEA BASS DRUNKEN NOODLES - Wonderful dish. The sea bass was excellent. Lightly fried, the fish was moist and flavorful with just a little bit of crispiness. The noodles were very good as well, with some heat from the chili and a nice herbal sweetness from the basil.\n\nI don't know a whole lot about Thai food so it's hard for me to really draw comparisons. I found this to be a pretty good meal, with the drunken noodles and sea bass to be a big highlight."

To say the least, we were all excited.  \n\nAs soon as i walked in, i was greeted by an extremely unfriendly hostess. She showed me to my table(refer to pic) and of course i was the first to get there. On the way to the table i was taken directly past their amazing wine room and beautiful art which lined the walls. After my colleagues arrived, we ordered some apps to be shared family style.\n\n1.KOONG SARONG ( Prawn in a blanket )\n-Absolutely delicious! Marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and rice paper crepe, deep fried, served with sweet and sour sauce.\n2.STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS\n-Good. Chicken wings stuffed with ground pork deep fried, served with sweet & sour sauce. Without the sauce, the chicken was dry. With the sauce, Great!\n3.NAM KAO TOD\n-Awesome! Minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice. We got this dish at a 7 heat level and it went beautifully with our wine selection!\n\nFor my entree i ordered the GINGER FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with ginger accompanied by a black mushroom sauce. This dish was really good. I stuck with a 4 heat level just to be cautious, and it definitely could have used more heat. The skin was perfectly cooked. With each bite of delicate flesh there was an even better crunch. The mushrooms added a nice earthiness to the dish which gave a great balance.\n\nOne of my colleagues ordered the SWEET & SOUR FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with Thai style sweet and sour sauce. which he had no complaints about. \n\nEverybody at the table seemed to enjoy everything... all except my general manager. For his entree he ordered DUCK with some sort or mint and ginger(from what i can remember). Not only did it come out after all of our entree's, but it was cold. Now we had a situation where no one wanted to eat until everybody had their food. The person that didn't have their food was, of course, one of the people paying. HORRIBLE FEELING! He finally got his food, and it didn't seem like he was enjoying any of his meal after that. I felt terrible for the guy, because he's a good friend, avid eater at this restaurant, and true foodie.\n\nFood:     4     star                                  \nService: 2.5  star                                     \nOverall:  3.5 star(rounded up to a 4)"

Almost 4x a year on my quarterly Vegas trips...but it had been awhile since I've been back. \n\nSo on my last trip, I decided to reward my belly with the best Thai food ever. Call me crazy, but I totally don't remember Lotus of Siam tasting as good as it did the last time I went. \n\nI had a party of 4 and no reservations early Sunday night. Luckily there was room for us (typically if you have no reso, you can expect to eat dinner at 9pm..or never!). It's always a good sign to see other customers coming to eat at the restaurant via taxi with all of their luggage in tow. You know they mean business. \n\nWe didn't order too much since we weren't that hungry. We had 2 soups (just cups) of the Tom Yum Kai and wonton soup. They were both great! We then ordered the green papaya salad, and weren't disappointed. It was so perfectly seasoned and refreshing. \n\nFor our entrees we ordered the green curry (it had eggplant..yumm), pad thai and the best chinese broccoli w/ fried pork belly I've ever had in the world. \n\nWhy oh why is fried pork belly bad for you? Well, just for an hour forget about how unhealthy it is and just eat as much as you can!! The 4 of us were fighting over the last piece of crispy goodness. \n\nThey expanded their dining area and even have a bar!! There are also 2 bathrooms for your enjoyment.\n\nThere are only 2 things I can complain about Lotus:\n1. The portions are smaller than your usual Thai joint. So if we were really hungry, we would have had to have ordered 2 more entrees and 1 more salad for sure for our party of 4. \n2. Service was incredibly slow during our dinner. I'm not sure if this is normal, or if they're still adjusting to the new additional dining area, but we waited a long long time for our food. We had to ask our waiter 2x to check on it. \n\nBut despite these 'complaints', they really won't stop me from coming back. If anything, I've been caught drooling at my desk, thinking about Lotus of Siam. It's definitely the best Thai I've ever had."

Second, there's nothing particularly wrong with eating Phad Thai or other basic noodle dishes, even if I skip them in general, but it's a huge error here, there are so many things on the menu you cannot find elsewhere, you are really missing out.\n\nHighlights:\n\nLarb, sour crispy rice, drunken noodles (found the sea bass to be over cooked and disappointing, the rest of the proteins I've tried with it have been fine), panang curry (GET THE SHORT RIB), thai beef salad, pork blood soup.  \n\nKeep in mind they have a pretty high heat tolerance, if you order something as a 5 on their 1-10 scale you will have quite a bit of heat, and I don't see a 10 as being enjoyable by any rational person including people who self-profess to never be able to get food hot enough.  I love spicy in general and wouldn't order anything much higher than a 6 or 7 here with the possible exception of the beef salad where the crisp vegetables compliment the heat very nicely."

It seemed fortuitous because I saw the show one month before a planned visit to Vegas. After going there with three other foodies, we all agree that it's a must-stop while visiting Vegas! We went there for lunch, and the large restaurant was full within 30 minutes of opening.\n\nWe decided to order some of the dishes we saw in the show that were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was delicious and had very tender pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also tried the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. It was much better than I expected! The star of the show, however, was the Garlic Prawns! This absolutely delicious dish consists of large shrimp that are deep fried with the shell and topped with a fantastic garlic sauce. It sounds unusual, but the shell is supposed to be eaten, and the way that it's prepared makes it almost like a shrimp chip. We liked the Garlic Prawns so much that we ordered a second dish! \n\nIt's true that Lotus of Siam is located far from the Vegas Strip in a remote area, but it's worth traveling to! It can take a while for cabs to come pick you up when called, so I suggest waiting to snag a cab that's dropping off someone instead. I'm already anticipating my return to this excellent restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas!"

It had a very light batter that was super crispy.  Skin was perfectly crispy.  The penang sauce was wonderful.  I don't eat a lot of Thai food so I can't compare it to other places, but it was really good.  The only compliant on this one is that its a relatively small portion for the price, also over $20.\n\nShrimp Pad Thai:\n\nI figured I had to try Pad Thai done proper.  Now I can't speak towards it's actual authenticity as I haven't had it in Thailand, but it was easily the best Pad Thai I've had.  The shrimp were also really large and perfectly cooked.

I have to say that the meal we had was one of the best culinary experiences I have had in my life, no kidding.  The five dishes we ordered were cooked flawlessly in the northern Thai style with wonderful seasonings and herbs.\n\nMy recommendations:\nCrispy fried shrimp with shell.  Eight large shrimp, enough for the four of us.  Tasty and not oily.\nScallops with chili basil leaves.  Four large scallops cooked perfectly.  My favorite dish.  These were just wonderful.\nDrunken noodles with soft shell crab.  Really tasty dish.\n\nI wish we could have tried every dish on the menu.  I don't know how they can serve so many people and keep the quality of the food so high.  For me this is a five star establishment for sure."

It's in a run-down strip mall next to a wig outlet (seriously), but the food is unbelievable.  Their menu is huge, so I can't even begin to give a comprehensive review, but everything I've had ranged from very good to phenomenal.  It has a reputation for being the best Thai restaurant in North America.  I'd suggest not going in with that expectation, as it's setting the bar pretty damn high, but Lotus of Siam is definitely an excellent dinner spot.  They also have a lunch buffet that I thought was a good meal, but a step down from dinner on the quality meter.\n\nOne specific recommendation: the spicy chicken wings make a great appetizer."

Everything that we have ever eaten here is top notch and delightful, especially the Crispy Garlic Prawns.  The wait is aggravating, and there is not much space for patrons to wait.  But with an advance reservation, the experience here is awesome.  Would be nice if they could update their decor a little.  While all the Thai decorations are beautiful, the carpeting is way past its prime, and it takes away from the experience a little.  We always come here when we have Thai relatives in town knowing that they will be very happy and impressed."

Arrive early or attempt to get reservation if you want to visit Lotus of Siam. From the outside it's unassuming and quiet but once inside it's bustling with excited foodie patrons. The menu is large, offering numerous dishes from multiple regions of Thailand. Do yourself a favor and order from the Northern or Chef Specials sections, you will not be disappointed. \n\nOur party of 4 tried:\n\nKoong Sarong - Very good, not greasy at all. Good dish for the less adventurous people in your party.\nNam Kao Top - (Spicy Level 4) While very limey, it's balanced much better when eaten with the cabbage.\nGarlic Prawns - My favorite dish of the night. I was not a huge fan of eating the shell but I tried it and enjoyed one. The shell was much more tender than I thought it would be but a little on the salty side. The actual prawn meat was delicious, perfectly cooked with a slight crisp on the outside.\nCrispy Duck with Panang - (Level 3) While I'm not a huge fan of duck, I had heard a lot about this dish and had to try it. The duck was cooked perfectly, crispy skin and moist on the inside. The meat was not overly fatty like I'm used to eating and the curry sauce was different (no coconut milk) but a great addition to the overall flavor.\nNua Nam Tok - (Spice Level 4) Very similar to the flavors of the Nam Kao Top, good but not great.\n\nWe noticed many people ordering the soups, especially the Fish Soup but it was over 105 degrees that day and soup was the furthest thing from what I wanted. It looked wonderful and will be my order when I go back in the winter.\n\nLotus is perfect for taking visiting friends from out of town who want to experience Vegas food off the strip. The food is good, the service was incredibly good, way better than I expected. If you're lucky you can start up a conversation with the James Beard winning Chef Saipin Chutima who was spotted multiple times walking through the dining area.\n\nThis is a must visit for anybody who lives in Vegas."

But I do want to make one suggestion to Yelpers:  Please, please, PLEASE look at the Northern Thai section of the menu.  While the rest of the menu is very, very good (especially loved the Garlic Prawns and Sea Bass on Drunken noodles), the Northern Thai section offers dishes that you won't find at most Thai restaurants.  We had two standouts, both based on recommendations of our very attentive waiter.\n\nThe first was Kang Ka Noon, which is jackfruit in a spicy curry sauce.  An article on NPR says that these are the largest tree fruit in the world, reaching up to 100 lbs each, and high in protein, potassium, and vitamin B2 (and yes, they are quite an interesting looking fruit).  However, when it is cut up and put into a dish, the jackfruit has the consistency of an artichoke heart.  Smooth, creamy and delicious.  And the curry sauce adds the perfect spice to balance the simple sweetness of the fruit.\n\nThe second dish was Khao Soi, a curried, egg noodle dish (with Burmese flavor influences) that we had with chicken.  Much like Pho has its salad accompaniment, so does Khao Soi:  onions, mustard greens, and lime.  Oh my goodness was this dish fantastic.  It was clearly the hit of the night.\n\nSo if you are an adventurous foodie (and you likely are if you are reading reviews in Yelp), step away from the traditional and go right for the Northern part of the menu.  You will not be sorry."

I ordered the jack fruit curry (because I've never seen it before) and enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. This place is pretty far off the Strip so if you're not driving it makes it difficult to get to. We had a party of 8 which made logistics of getting us there and then back to our various destinations a little tricky. Plus when you come out here you really in the desert as we were left trying to figure out what to do to kill time for our 45 minute wait. If you have the forethought call ahead and put your name in so you don't end up in that same dilemma. \n\nIn conclusion, I said it before and I'll say it again? I would hesitate to call this the best Thai, it might be the most authentic but I can't really comment on that.

With accolades like that, I tend to have high expectations.... Expectations that were not met.\n\nWhen you arrive at Lotus of Siam, it looks just like every other Thai restaurant found in any old town. It appears to be made up of several converted spaces that makes it feel like a Bingo hall. There are water damage stains on the ceiling where crystal chandeliers from the early 80's hang under fluorescent lights. Dusty framed pieces of art depicting elephants drawn with sequins adorn the walls. It really couldn't be any more of a cliche. Then there was the menu. Inundated with over 150 items, I was enormously overwhelmed by the task at hand. Luckily, the website lists a number of recommendations within each course. So we went with the Koong Sarong or \"Prawn in Blanket.\" This dish featured marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and wonton wraps, deep fried, and served with homemade sweet and sour sauce. Was it good? Of course! It was amazing! But what isn't when wrapped in bacon and deep fried. The prawns were done just right and the sauce balanced out the heaviness of the wonton nicely.\n\nThey say that the true test of a brilliant chef is to order the simplest menu item and see how they are able to make it their own. It seemed like a reasonable challenge, but not so much that night. I went with my old standby Pad Thai and couldn't wait to see what Chef Saipin Chutima would do. Unfortunately, I was sadly underwhelmed. The dish tasted okay, but I had seen this dozens of times before. It was by no means a revelation. In fact, it was overly oily and too sweet. My companions ordered Charbroiled Beef which was very grisly, and while the Sweet and Sour Chicken was nice and fresh, the use of cilantro was overpowering and just too much. It could very well be that we just did not order the right menu items. But in my opinion, any item coming out of such a heralded kitchen should be cooked to perfection. \n\nMy advice: save up and splurge at a \"Strip\" restaurant such as Shibuya at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. It will cost a bit more but the experience will be worth it. My lesson learned: every dining experience and plate is different. Critically acclaimed restaurants do not always deliver as you would like them to."

Then go ahead and tell everyone!\n\nWhat to order:\n- Khao Soi - A curry noodle dish from the Northern menu. You don't find Northern Thai food too often in restaurants, but based on this dish, we should see it more. You've had Pad Thai a million times, get this superior noodle dish instead.\n- Garlic Prawns - Not overly greasy, not quite tempura, not quite salt baked, utterly perfect. The prawns are huge, well seasoned, and the shells (also fried) are equally delicious!\n- Crispy Duck in Penang - I've basically only had duck cooked the Chinese way (roasted, Peking-style, or braised) or the western way (confit or medium rare breast). This is a whole new world of preparation, and it's incredible. The texture is great without sacrificing flavor. And baby, I could bathe in that panang. \n\nTips:\n- If you're going for dinner, you'll want to make a reservation. Lunch doesn't take reservations, so just get there as early as possible.\n- Dishes are pricier than other Thai restaurants, and they are also typically smaller (trust me, it's well worth it!). Order accordingly. \n- The spice scale (from 1-10) is calibrated toward an American palate. So if you're like me and have a real need for heat, order EVERYTHING at level 10. You can request for it even higher if you really want to punish your GI tract.\n- Driving is preferable as the cabs can be unreliable. I'd keep your valuables out of sight though.\n\nIf you're only having one meal it Vegas, eat here.\nIf you're staying for several days, eat here at least twice."

When hubby and I arrived, we were rather dismayed to find ourselves standing outside the rather shabby exterior, flanked by questionable businesses in a sketchy strip mall.  However, all reservations dissipated when spotting the many photos of celebs on the walls and smelling the yummy smells within.  The four of us chose the pad Thai (with chicken), snapper, drunken noodles with tofu, and the northern style sausage.  All were excellent: not drowning in sauce, no bad aftertaste, just flavourful food that made us overeat.  :)  Service was especially good: attentive, patient, yet unobtrusive.  Prices are mid-level (around $12-15/entree) and portions were generous, not ridiculously so.  We will definitely come again."

            "review": "Ate at Lotus of Siam again last weekend. Yum! Mr. Tracy A. tried one of the northern Thai dishes with jack fruit -- a departure from what you usually see on a Thai menu. It was delicious, with a spicy tomato-y broth. I'm even willing to forgive them for making a mistake with our order, because they corrected it promptly and were very nice about the whole thing. I had a #55 -- I rarely order beef with Thai meals, but the flavors were so tempting that's what I had, and am glad I did.\n\nI would award 4.5 stars if Yelp would let me. I must say that their Nam Sod wasn't as good as other times. (Plus, they couldn't get me a simple order of sticky rice to go with my Nam Sod. They were very, very busy that day since it was a holiday, Jan 2.) But their food is delicious, with a really wide range of menu options. I'd love to be having lunch there again right about now. I suppose the one thing I would most like to change about L of S is the atmosphere -- oftentimes you're stuck sitting very near the buffet. It's great when you can get seated in the separate little room, off toward the front of the restaurant."

Food is probably an easy 4-4.5*; it's solid, no-frills Thai food. My favorites are their roasted duck curry, the sai oua sausage, nam prik noom, drunken noodle anything, and probably the seared scallops too. Oh yeah, their poached salmon is to die for.\n\nA few years ago I probably would have rounded up to 5* without hesitation, but I feel like service has gone a bit downhill. Lunch has always been a bit iffy service-wise, although I haven't been for lunch since the buffet closed so hopefully it's been better since then. I also have to mention on one occasion earlier this year, I was visiting with a friend who needed to catch a flight out. Despite letting the manager know we were in a rush, she wouldn't let us eat at the bar in the back even though she was letting other people eat at the bar. No idea what was up with that.\n\nUnfortunately, I also have to hate on the location. It is just such a sketchy area - I get panhandled frequently in the parking lot when I visit Lotus, and one time a guy creepily followed me out to my car. I don't get scared much, but it was just super creepy. This kind of stuff isn't really directly under Lotus' control, but it's still a big negative."

            "review": "I don't think I have EVER been to a Thai restaurant as good as this one. It was TOTALLY worth the two hour wait to be seated and the two years it took me to get there. While waiting, many of the regulars (many who come in from out of town) advised us what to order and we looked at the extensive 15 page menu.\n\nTom Kah Kai soup was exquisite. The first thing that hits you is the great aroma. It had layers of flavors-sweet, salty, with a taste of lime and coconut all with a bit of spice throughout. The white meat chicken was thinly sliced and tender and mushrooms that were firm but not overcooked.\n\nWoon Sen soup (Bankok style) was delicious. The first thing noticed was how it was seasoned with the right amount of salt. The Napa cabbage was cooked perfectly, crunchy but not raw as were the cellophane noodles. The black mushrooms and chicken only enhanced it.\n\nThe garlic prawns is one of the most popular items on the menu. Now, I know why. The prawns are deep fried with the shell on and topped with black pepper, having a potato chip texture with a bite. Then, there's the garlic that tasted like it was infused throughout each prawn. This is something that I'd definitely order again.\n\nCrispy duck on drunken noodles was the favorite dish ordered. I was surprised at how crispy the duck actually was, being that it was covered by the sauce of the noodles. The meat itself was moist and flavorful and not greasy like most duck I've ordered from other restaurants in the past. It was placed on a bed of flat noodles that was swimming and over saturated in a sauce, hence the name drunken. The sauce was salty with a sweet and sour aspect in it and a mild spiciness.\n\nLotus of Siam has won award after award every year since 2008 and it's an experience that shouldn't be missed if you are anywhere near Las Vegas."

Our server was very accommodating and only charged my friend an extra $2 for all the changes she wanted.\n\nI ordered the Pad Prik King with chicken and asked for it to be \"pretty spicy\".

            "review": "If you are looking for an unassuming ethnic restaurant located in a strip mall in not the best part of town that serves authentic high-quality food from a James Beard award-winning chef at reasonable prices ... well, many people would tell you that you're insane, and such a place cannot possibly exist. But such a place does exist my friends. It's called Lotus of Siam - known to many as the best Thai restaurant in America for over a decade, and home to the culinary masterpieces of multiple-time nominee and 2011 James Beard award-winning chef Saipin Chutima. \n\nI first went to Lotus on my first trip to Vegas in 2008, after hearing continuous raves from my close friend and Yelper Jay F. They were already starting to get a buzz then, with one magazine proclaiming them the best Thai restaurant in America, and it's been great to see how the buzz has grown to Beard Awards and feature episodes on Top Chef Masters. A couple of weeks back was my first trip there in about four years, and it was nice to see that the restaurant has been expanded and renovated inside to better reflect it's reputation and quality cuisine. \n\nMy friend and I arrived at close to 9PM on a Monday night. They close at 9:30, but true to Lotus form, they were PACKED and more were flocking in. We took a seat at the nice bar (new since I last visited) and was pleased to see a small but thoughtful selection of bottled beer (many people were enjoying Stone IPA) and a selection of sake. (Wine is the thing to come here for - they have an impressive selection and showcase their wine storage room prominently - but I'm just not a wine person.) Shortly after ordering and receiving my hot sake, we were called for our table. \n\nWe started with 2 apps - the Issan Style Beef Jerky (13a) and Nam Ko Tod (14), which is essentially a crispy rice salad served with minced sour pork sausage and unlike anything I have ever had. Amazing. As always, we ordered both a 10 spicy, but felt these were a little lower - maybe a 7 in \"Lotus Spice\", which is equal to the \"10\" at most other places. \n\nFor my entree, I decided to bypass the \"go to\" dishes I had tried in the past and went with a traditional Massaman curry. And that's the great thing about Lotus - they have a huge menu with some truly creative and unique offerings that will blow you away. But for the less adventurous, they offer the same traditional Thai dishes that you can get at any neighborhood Thai restaurant, and at the same price. The difference is that it is prepared by a highly decorated chef, and it will be the best version of the traditional Thai dish you have ever had. I'll put my neighborhood Thai restaurant in Manassas up against any Thai restaurant in America - except Lotus. This was, hands down, the best Massaman curry I have ever had. And this time, the 10 spicy was indeed a 10 ... several pitchers of water were needed. (And you certainly are reminded the day after that you indeed did order the \"10\")\n\nIf there is any issue with Lotus, it's that the service can be a little bit hit or miss. There was some confusion with the server, and my friend was served the wrong entree. However, after pointing this out, our server went back to the kitchen and produced the proper entree in minutes ... and it was spot on. They make mistakes, but they handle them properly and professionally. \n\nLotus isn't just the best Thai in Vegas ... it's the best Thai in America, the best restaurant in Vegas, and one of the best restaurants in America. All at prices that are no more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant. Any foodie that's been to Vegas and hasn't been to Lotus can't call themselves a foodie or say they've really been to Vegas. It's THAT good."

As a spicy food obsessive, this crying jag is a great memory, nothing negative of the sort.  My red-faced, drippy-nosed self was finally brave enough to get the wonderful server's attention, who removed the salad, and replaced it with a milder, uber-flavorful version...without us even requesting it and with no charge.  After ordering so-called \"Thai Hot\" for years from Thai restaurants in Indiana, I realized how much more authentically hot Thai food should be, thanks to Lotus.\n\nWe had walked from the Strip, underestimating the trek and how the surroundings were a bit creepy at night.  After going back and forth on flagging a cab, we finally made it to the strip mall and Lotus, and were able to be seated right away for dinner without a reservation.\n\nBesides the burning hot Thai papaya salad, we split a delicious (cooling) bottle of Riesling. My dining partner ordered the whole catfish with sweet and sour sauce, and loved it. I had the red curry with tofu, with fresh basil and bamboo.  If you love Thai food, Lotus of Siam should be on your foodie wish list; escape the Strip and seek this place out.  And if I ever visit Las Vegas again, I hope to revisit with a larger group of co-diners...just so I could taste a larger variety of Lotus's authentic, truly wonderful dishes."

Had plenty of time to look at their extensive menu. Lots of dishes I've never seen before,  even when I visited Northern Thailand.   \n\nGot the Sea Bass in a sweet & spicey sauce. Loved it.  So delicately battered but only 3 good size pieces for $28.  Tried the Crispy Garlic Prawns in shell for roughly $25.  Everyone was ordering them. I think we got 5 giant prawns and the rest was just deep fried shells. They were very tasty, not at all greasy but I felt a little bamboozled and would have liked a few more prawns for the price.  Tried the egg rolls because my son wanted them but why fill up on standard fare with such a unique assortment of food so masterfully prepared?  We also got a Northern Thailand dish of slices of beef in a rich dark sauce ...almost a gravy over egg noodles. Very complex flavors.  We asked for a 7 on the spicey scale and we were sweating! They don't dumb the food down here so be prepared.\n\nToo full for desert so they gave us a scoop of homemade Coconut Ice Cream on the house.

I read all the (Zagat) hype, heard all the praise, and, on more than one occasion, mentioned the reviews of it being the \"Best Thai in North America.\"\n\nAll in all, it ended up being a huge letdown and I was embarrassed at bringing a large party of 8 to this restaurant and making reservations one month in advance.  \n\n1) Location - Lotus of Siam is located in the middle of a strip mall and it isn't an easy location for most cabs to find.  The neighborhood is questionable and in the evenings is probably not the safest locale.\n\n2) Decor - reflective of its strip mall location, the interior is nothing special.  There are, however, typical Thai touches (flowers and statues) and plenty of newspaper articles touting it's reputation as a great Thai restaurant.\n\n3) Food - While many reviews talk about the amazing flavors and the incredible tastes, I found everything to be absolutely average.  Given the high expectations, I was obviously disappointed, but even without those expectations, I'd be hard pressed to even call the food good.  All the dishes chosen were \"signature\" dishes recommended by our waiter and each failed to impress.\n\nWith every bite I took, I just wondered how the heck the Gourmet magazine food review could be so off and what kool-aid all the reviewers were drinking.  Even now, I can think of a dozen Thai restaurants better than Lotus of Siam and probably only one or two that I've considered worse.  \n\nIn the end, as I waited 45 minutes for a cab to pick up our group from the seedy strip mall location, I figured it all must be a tourist trap.  One  stellar review must have spawned the rest or maybe, none of the people who were gushing over Lotus had ever been to a Thai restaurant.  \n\nFor the Las Vegas that is home  to the $4.99 Steak and Egg breakfast and the 24 hour buffet, Lotus of Siam may be a revolutionary restaurant.  But for North America??  Lotus of Siam falls amazingly flat."

            "review": "What took me so long to come here and eat?!  Lotus of Siam has long held the reputation of being one of the top Thai restaurants in the country and I finally got to experience the bombness of this place!  Perhaps, it's because of the location.  It is in a very seedy party of town that LOOKS seedy during the day and even seedier at night.  Great food found in a dumpy strip mall?  Perfect.\n\nWe went during lunch time and did not go with the lunch buffet.  As advised by on of our Lotus of Siam experience friends, we chose to order from the menu instead and it was the way to go!  I think everything we chose was deep fried in some form or another, which lead to a cholesterol fest of food.  I'm getting older, so that stuff don't phase me (yet).\n\n- Our introduction was Garlic Prawns.  Crispy + salty = good.\n\n- Next came the Chilean Seabass and Drunken Noodles and Crispy Duck Panang.  Flavors were on the saltier side, but again, I am a sucker for CRISPY!!\n\n- My most favorite dish was Nam Koi Tod (minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice).  I've never had this dish before anywhere, so it was a fun new dish.  Crispy crunchy rice with the fragrant flavors of all the fixings left a party in my mouth!\n\nConclusion:  Lotus of Siam lives up to the hype.  Will definitely go back and try other menu items."

Consultants tend to really know their restaurants, so we knew we had to check it out. \n\nThe wine menu in this place is stunning! I had an Auslese riesling that was sweet and delectable.\n\nThe larb salad, fried tofu, and yellow curry were all fantastic and some of the best I have ever had, and I have eaten those at many, many places over the course of the last 2 decades. Cashew chicken was pretty great too. \n\nThe only thing that was just okay was the tom yum soup - definitely decent, but not the best ever. They got the sour part right, but I like mine super fragrant with lots of lemongrass and cilantro, which this did not have. \n\nI only wish we'd had room for dessert - we both felt very sad that we didn't have any space left to try it (if you check out what all we ordered above, you can see why, haha)!\n\nOverall, we LOVED it, and Lotus of Siam is going to become a pilgrimage every time we hit up Vegas."

I ordered the Garlic Prawns, Drunken Noodles, and Coconut/Sticky Rice Dessert. The Garlic Prawns were fantastically garlic ridden and crispy/crunchy. The fry was perfect and the prawn meat itself was juicy. The Drunken Noodles while small in portion, had a great flavor and \"dragon's breath\" flavor. The noodles themselves were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of chewiness. Lastly, to round out my meal I had their dessert: coconut/sticky rice. The coconut flavored ice cream tasted fresh and the steaming sticky rice gave the perfect contrast to the ice cream. Overall, a great Thai food restaurant and next time I'm in Las Vegas, I will definitely be hitting this place up again."

I am not big on Thai food but I have to say this place takes the cake, way better then the couple other places I went. I got the drunken noodles with soft shell crab at a level 2 because I am not into spicy foods and it still had a little cook to the juice. \n\nMy friend got a number 8 and was in tears, haha. I guess it goes from 0-10 so see what you can handle if that is what you like. The service is good, when you walk in you feel like its a small place because the lobby/waiting area is tiny but plenty of space in the dining area.

Real seedy joint. We almost didn't go in based on that. We should've kept our 1st mind. I know there are loads of positive reviews here... Trust them at your own risk.\n\nWe came for early dinner on Friday. No waiting. Great! The sever... Well it took us till the end of dinner to determine who our server really was... He was the worst part of our experience. We ordered Pad Thai, Panang curry, and Seafood Thai Fried Rice. The Pad Thai smelled awful. We didn't eat it. Wanted to send it back, but we were told by the server \"It's not my fault, you ordered, someone has to pay for it.\" Excuse me?!? Nuff said. We'll NEVER BE BACK. Asked for the manager, and we were treated like criminals.\n\nThe portions here are small for the prices. Truly nothing to swoon over as far as taste. I've learned that Food Network is not always right. Restaurants probably pay to be on TV. \nI'm sure they weren't treated the way we were for not liking an entree'.\n\nSomeone suggested Archie's to us. We'll try them next time we're in Vegas.

I was not very impressed during our first visit as the restaurant is located in a shady, shady, shady neighborhood. we arrived there at 3pm that afternoon only to find that the restaurant only open for lunch 11ish to 2:30 and dinner starting from 5:30pm. so at that moment I felt somewhat relieved.\n\nthe next day we were looking for places to have a quick dinner before heading to the airport. as I was curious how this restaurant was able to deserve such a good review on Yelp, I proposed we try this place! we arrived exactly at 5:30, hoping to get in immediately when it opens. and guess what? there was already a very long waiting line in front of the restaurant! definitely a good sign! \n\nas soon as we were able to get into the restaurant, a waiter comes to us with a charming smile asking if we had a reservation or not. (so apparently they take reservations and can be overly booked) we expressed our need to catch a flight and the waiter was very kind in finding a seat for us as quickly as possible. when we sat down and started to checking out the interior of the restaurant, we realized where the  owner have spent all her money. the interior decoration looks like a fancy, high-class dining room with chandeliers, hard wood tables and chairs, mirror-like clean floors and a huge wine collection!\n\nit's quite unfortunate we were not able to try the wine due to time constraints and we only had one dish as neither me nor my bf was hungry. we tried the crisp duck curry  as recommended and it turns out to be really really great! the duck was crispy outside, juicy inside and when the curry swims in your mouth, you would want to bite your tongue off! I also ordered a Thai ice tea and it doesn't fail to surprise me either!\n\nbtw, the waiter is very tentative and knows what dish to get!\n\nwell, enough has been said. this is a must try in Vegas!"

I''ve heard so many rave reviews about this place and this trip to vegas, i just couldn't pass it up.  I made reservations a week in advance, just to secure my table for 5!  Everything was really delicious and If i must say, a lot better than i've had in Thailand.  Their green curry is AMAZING and the best i've ever had.  Everyone at the table loved it so much we decided to order a second order!  The papaya salad with raw crab was also one of the best I've had.  My favorite is still on the street in Bangkok, but this one was almost just as amazing!  That salad packs a lot of flavor which i love because I usually have to wait overnight for all the flavors to be absorbed by the papaya, but not at lotus of siam!  That alone gets 5 stars and so does the green curry.\n\nWe also ordered nam prik noom which is a northern green chili dip that is really good with fried pork skin and plain sticky rice.  This was probably my least favorite dish, as the flavor of the green chili wasn't like the kind i've had in thailand.  it's still pretty good though!\n\nThe thai boat noodles was good, but the broth could of had more beef flavor.  If you like this dish, you should definitely hit up Yum Saap (or Saap as its called on Yelp) in West Hollywood.  Its the closest boat noodle to the kind in thailand!\n\nThe Nam kao Tod, was something I have never tried and I thought it was pretty interesting and yummy.  Some people at the table didn't like it because the sausage is sour, but its supposed to be.  If you aren't a fan of sour sausage, then maybe stay away from this dish.\n\nThe Put Prik King is also one of the best I've had.  We got ours with pork and the flavor of the prik is soooooo good!  Other thai resturants either make this dish too sweet or too salty or not much flavor.  Each bite of lOS's Put prik king is packed with flavor and is so delicious with hot fluffy jasmine rice! =)  \n\nI wanted to so badly order everything to-go so I could enjoy it back home in LA.  \n\nI highly highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants the best Thai food in the US. imo. haha prove me wrong!  =P"

Best Thai food you'll ever eat!\"\n\nI made a reservation 3 weeks ago since I had a party of 10 and they do require a credit card to hold your spot. I was a little iffy but decided to oblige since I heard this place was THAT good.\n\nI got a Thai iced tea as a drink and it was perfect - not too sweet. I ordered the tom yum soup with shrimp to start. Wow this was SPICY. I have a very, very high spice tolerance and this was actually spicy to me for once. It was delicious though!\n\nAs my entree, I got my staple drunken noodles with seafood. Boy... These were good - during my meal and as cold leftovers!\n\nMy other friends ordered the crispy duck with noodles (highly recommended!!), pad Thai, pad see ew, etc. and they all seemed to enjoy it.\n\nService was attentive and food was excellent beyond belief!\n\nNote: they only accept 4 credit cards max. This was a big problem in my 10 party group."

I'm definitely a fan.\n\nI tried a few of new dishes, based on fellow Yelpers, hoping to rant about them, as they did: the spicy chicken wings, the crispy duck in panang, and the beef jerky.  The spicy chicken wings are dripping and delicious.  The duck was good, but we thought that the short ribs in panang (from our last visit) was better.  The jerky was reminiscent of Filipino tapa, but less tangy.\n\nAgain, we had the garlic prawns.  Wow!  You can put them damn things in the freezer and bake them the next day to the same yummy goodness.  This time the seabass on drunken noodle was good, but the fish was as crisp and juicy as our first endevour.  \n\nI do have to note that we did \"take out\" this time around.  I don't know if that made a difference on the quality.  They gave us a 40 minute wait time.  We got there at exactly 40 mins, but it took them another 10 minutes to complete our order, once we arrived."

Seasoned very nicely with lemongrass cutting through. Large chunks of beef that is tender. Bit heavy on the raw onions. Level 10 spicy blows your socks off. \n\nDrunken noodle with chicken - if you like the taste of basil you'll love this dish.

Service is also very attentive and professional, and I was checked on multiple times throughout my meal.\n\nThe menu is extensive, and the food was great! I particularly enjoyed the texture of my crispy duck. I also ordered the shredded green papaya salad; it was good, but I've definitely had better. They offer a 0-10 spice level, and I ordered somewhere on the low-medium side and the spiciness barely registered; I definitely need to pick a higher number next time.\n\nMy biggest qualm with Lotus of Siam is the somewhat outrageous prices. I know duck is usually more expensive, but I think my duck dish was $25+, and not even that big of a portion. At a Cantonese restaurant, you can get an entire peking duck for that much money! \n\nThe food here is excellent and I would still consider coming back, but just be prepared to spend a decent amount of money to get full. I easily finished all of my food and spent about $40 after tax and tips for one person."

The other thing he said was, \"This place is located in the Tenderloin of Vegas. It's sketchy for sure.\" \n\nSo right on both counts. The food was so good. We had the fried prawns where the entire prawn is deep fried to a crisp and you eat it in its entirety. We also had the duck and the beef over rice noodles. It's not what I usually order at Thai restaurants, but I thought it was pretty darn yummmm. \n\nHe was also right about it's surroundings. We were accosted by a couple of \"professional\" pan handlers, TWICE, in the parking lot. And he also pointed out some bar called \"The Green Door\" across the lot: a swingers club. So umm, yeah...it's a rather questionable area. \n\nBut the environs doesn't seem to deter patrons from frequenting this place because it's busy busy. Make reservations if you're planning to come here. The service is friendly and the place is clean, though it lacks much character. \n\nSo, if you want to venture beyond the Penang Beef and the Pad Thai dishes, ignore the panhandlers and head on in to get some awesome Thai food ;)"

The sauce that came with it is creamy and yummy! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered pork pad thai which is amazing as well. But for my yellow pork curry, I am not too impressed. I think personally I am used to Indian curry which is thick and creamy , so when I tried Thai curry , it is too watery for me. The veggie inside is not too cooked in my opinon, and I ordered a 7 out of a 10 spicy scale  which is way too spicy than any other 7 at other Thai places.\n\nAfter all, I still think of it as a good Thai food option, but I kind of think it is over rating on yelp, especially after a 30min wait.

            "review": "Lotus of Siam definitely lived up to the hype. The food was really great, particularly with regards to the main courses. Appetizers were all decent, if a tad boring (with the exception of the bacon and wonton-wrapped shrimp). The wontons and dumplings were only offered with chicken, while most of us would have preferred pork. The beer and wine list was quite good, and I even saw one of my favorite IPAs for a jaw-dropping $3.50 (though our table opted for Singhas all around - when in Thai restaurants, right?).\n\nThe entrees are what really got everyone excited. Our table was filled with drunken noodles, pad Thai, curries and more. My crispy duck over drunken noodles was excellent. I mostly stuck to the outer edges since duck is just so fatty by nature, but I was able to get the flavor I wanted from a few of the leaner bites with my delicious noodles. I requested my heat level at a four, which was perfect for me (I like things spicy but not uncomfortably so). A friend requested her shrimp in green curry at a four, and it seemed much hotter. So I'd probably knock that down to a three. \n\nEven though the food was awesome, the service was a bit spotty at times. It was hard to pinpoint which person was our main server. We had to ask for drink refills more than once and a requested knife was never delivered. Still, I would definitely like to return on my next visit to Las Vegas. \n\n\n*Out of towners, definitely make reservations and know that a cab ride is going to cost you."

For under $10, you can get a wide variety of dishes, which changes all the time so you don't get bored with the same selection. \n\nI had dinner here with a girlfriend recently and was pleasantly surprised that Lotus had expanded and now also has a bar. We sat at the bar while waiting for our table. The wine selection is huge, especially for an Asian establishment. \n\nWe ordered the stuffed chicken wings, papaya salad, Tom Kha Kai, and Crab Fried Rice. I had to keep the selection tame since my gf is still new to Thai cuisine. The Crab Fried Rice is exceptionally good here, made with real chunks of crab\n\n\nLotus is the only Thai restaurant that includes dishes cooked with jackfruit and other exotic ingredients. They also make a killer fried catfish dish which is smothered in a sweet chili sauce. I wish there were more people with us so that I could order that big dish. Another one of my favorite dish here is the Tom Yum Noodle Soup. I love Tom Yum soup but this is the first place where I discovered the noodle version of this dish. I love Pho & Hu Tieu and this is a great Thai version of the two. It's great to eat on a cold day."

            "review": "Ugh I hate not giving at least a 4 star to a place as legendary as LOS. Perhaps it's because of too high expectations going in again and I've been looking forward to this place for weeks before my Vegas trip. We were dirty and running late after a hike in Red Rocks and booked it across town to make it here before they close for lunch.\n\nCrispy duck in Panang curry - The duck was cooked really well and there was not a bone in site, unlike a majority of duck curries I've had in my life. The Panang curry was also quite tasty. However despite the good portion of duck, I thought $26 bucks or something was a bit overpriced.\n\nKhao soi with beef - The cheapest but actually over favorite dish of the day. Flavor of the soup was incredibly rich and complex, and I really liked the slightly chewy texture of the egg noodles.\n\nGarlic prawns - The most disappointing dish... The prawns are ginormous for sure, definitely why this dish costs nearly 30 bucks. The prawns are deshelled and both the shell and the meat are fried. The prawns themselves were very tasty though teetering on the edge of being overcooked. The shells, however, I found to be not crispy enough. They were certainly fried through and through, but I think it's a factor of the size of the prawn. When they get this big, the shells just simply get too thick and tough. To be honest, I rather have smaller prawns and a crispier shell than this.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we still had a really delicious lunch here, but I'm just mostly saddened but the dish I was looking forward the most to didn't live up to expectations."

We ordered the Tom Yum soup, pad thai, another soup based noodle dish (I can't remember the name of) and the garlic prawns.\n\nThe tom yum soup, slightly different flavor from what we were used to, but it was still really good. Pad thai, not the very best, yet it still ranks up there. The other noodle dish, wasn't the best, that's probably why I couldn't remember the name of it. Lastly, the star of the show, the garlic prawns! Very tasty and filling, one complaint that I do have about it was that it was a little dry and over cooked. The prawns didn't have that moist, buttery taste to it. \n\nIt's a very busy place, if you make a reservation and you're five minutes late, you'll lose your reservation. The popularity of this place is well deserved, yet I cannot claim it was the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Yet, it is a legacy restaurant and if you're ever in Vegas, you have to try it at least once."

            "review": "Having lived in Thailand for a couple years and eating Thai food all over the country, I came to this restaurant with high expectations due to the yelp reviews. Here is my opinion of this place. The food quality is pretty basic and authentic. Tastes like a home cook meal - dishes here are a bit more salty, like food made in Thailand. Regarding taste and authenticity I would rate this restaurant as a 2.5*. The prices is over priced. Price/value is 2*. \n\nHere is what we had.\n\nHoh Mok Sea Bass (Hor Mok) - $29 - tastes authentic but lacks flavor. Needs to add some finely julienned kafir leaves - which I could not find present in my dish. This dish is normally cooked and served using a small clay pot. This restaurant cooks this dish inside a foil pouch. The top of portion of our Hor Mok, including the fish was somewhat dried (should have been more moist), while there is excess juice accumulated at the bottom of the foil pouch. (If I had known this, I could have tried to fix this by flipping the pouch for a while before flipping it back upright.... lol)\n\nGarlic Prawns. $22 - I feel our shrimp was a bit too salty and over cooked, causing the shrimp to be dried up. The shrimp should not be deep fried for too long like they did at this restaurant. Once done properly you should get a juicy shrimp with a crispy coating on the outside. This dish is basically prepared in the same way as the Chinese salt and pepper pork chop.\n\nMango with sticky rice. the sticky rice was on the firmer side and not as tender and smooth tasting. Mango was fresh mango."

            "review": "***Lotus of Siam is a very good Thai restaurant and easily the best value I've ever had in Vegas, which is filled with overpriced and mediocre restaurants***\n\nLotus of Siam is a very well respected Thai restaurant in Las Vegas (it recently won a James Beard award).  The restaurant is off The Strip but not too far away.  The restaurant is located in a deserted kind of strip mall and has a no frills decor, but it is nice enough.  The restaurant is clean and has warm colors (the walls are outfitted with many photos--I guess with pictures of celebrities though I did not take a close look).  The restaurant is also bigger than I expected and was very busy (luckily, we had reservations).\n\nThe menu at Lotus of Siam is huge.  There is an unbelievable number of dishes and they range from all kinds of proteins (beef, pork, shrimp, chicken, many kinds of fish) to many different types (soups, salads, noodles, appetizers, and so on).  We tried several things.  Here is the rundown.\n\n(Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and served with sweet and sour sauce).  The chicken wings were moist and flavorful as well as crispy (and not greasy).  The sauce was thin and mostly sweet.\n\n(Tom Yum Kung hot and sour soup with shrimp, lime juice, lemongrass, and straw mushrooms) The soup had a strong citrus flavor as well as good fragrance from the fresh herbs.  There was a very generous portion of shrimp, which were plump and moist.  The soup was surprisingly spicy and left quite the tingling on the tongue.\n\n(Thai Beef salad with onion, tomato, chili, lime juice, and greens) I liked this one more than my friends, who were surprised by its lack of salad-ness.  The salad was mostly a stir fry, but the meat was nicely cooked and had a good flavor.  I liked the lime flavor as well as the moistness of the plate.\n\n(Charbroiled prawns with garlic black pepper sauce) The prawns were big, moist and tender.  The garlic black pepper sauce was good and not too overpowering.\n\n(Pad Thai with chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts, and chopped peanut and Thai fried rice with shrimp, egg, onion, and tomato) Their Pad Thai and their fried rice were the only disappointing dishes of the night.  The noodles were too soft and clumped together too much.  The other ingredients were fine, but the overall flavor was nothing special compared to other Thai spots I've tried.  The same could be said for their fried rice.\n\n(Crispy duck with chili, mint leaves and Thai basil) The duck was very good--moist but with a great crispy and crunchy outside batter.  The garnishes were flavorful and fragrant.\n\n(Braised beef short rib panang with a red cream curry sauce and cognac) The creamy sauce was great--great flavor and incredible fragrance.  The short rib was just okay.  While mostly tender, the short rib varied from kind of dry in some parts to too fatty in other parts.\n\n(Fried banana rolls) I liked the very egg roll-like wrapper (crispy, thin and not too sweet).  The banana was sweet and good.  I liked it, but it was nothing exceptional.\n\n(Coconut ice cream) The ice cream had a good flavor and was creamy, but it was a little sorbet like.\n\nService was friendly, but it did take a while for us to put in our order.  The first dishes took a little bit of time to come out and I wished that our second run of dishes would have been spaced apart more (too much came out at the same time).\n\nPrices were very good.  Given the quality and the fact that Lotus of Siam is in Vegas, the meal was easily the best bang-for-your-buck meal I've ever had in Vegas.\n\nWhile I am not that experienced with Thai food, I really enjoyed Lotus of Siam.  Many of the dishes were good.  Since Las Vegas has so many overpriced restaurants, it was very refreshing to try a place like Lotus of Siam where you could spend less but not sacrifice in terms of quality.  If I was ever in Vegas again with a big group and needed a satisfying but also reasonably priced dinner, we would definitely head to Lotus of Siam.\n\nThe strip mall has a huge and free parking lot."

I was so excited to finally try this place out on my most recent trip to Vegas. \n\nMy husband and I came by on a Tuesday afternoon around 11:30am. There was no wait, but the restaurant was pretty busy! We got seated right away. \n\nSeafood soup - Soup was tangy and perfect for the chilly day. It was came with tons of seafood! \n\nPad See Ew with chicken - This is a standard Thai dish that we decided to order, and it was not that great! It was bland and the noodles were cooked too long. I've definitely had better at local Thai places in SoCal. \n\nGarlic Prawns - Couldn't leave this place without trying this. It's pretty pricey, but was worth the $$ for me! It comes with about 7 pieces of prawns. It was interesting because the shells were deep fried in the garlic mix, and they were so good! This was definitely a hit for me! \n\nBanana egg roll with coconut ice cream - This is a pretty large dessert for two, but we ended up finishing more than half. The egg roll was filled with bananas and deep fried. The coconut ice cream is the perfect match with the egg rolls. Would highly recommend! \n\nNext time, I'll be more bold and try the more authentic Northern Thai dishes!"

Yes it's in a gritty neighborhood but I applaud the restaurants efforts in keeping it real and being accessible to all types of patrons. \n     Reservations are a must so we stopped by during lunch hours on Wednesday to secure a reservation for our party of 8 for the following night. We were warned about the 5 minute rule, which is essentially if all in your party are not there within 5 minutes of reservation, your table is forfeited. \n     We arrived Thursday, we're seated promptly and after some time put in drink orders. The selection of rieslings by the bottle is extensive and a bit overwhelming. Placed our order to include the following dishes:\n* Rad Na with shrimp @ $11.95. - 4.5 stars, yum gravy. \n* Braised short rib with panang @ $22.95. - 4.5 stars, tender with spot on curry.\n* Chow mein with chicken. @ $ 8.95. We had 9 year olds to feed, need I say more? 3 stars, but who comes here for chow mein?\n* Chicken Rama @ $21.95. - 1 star. Biggest disappointment of the night.  Got this for 2 kiddos to share and it was rather sad especially for the price. The plate consisted of about 5-6 half doll\nar sized pieces of flattened white chicken on a handful of steamed snow peas and about three asparagus. Everyone was shocked when I mentioned the price. \n* Salmon Nam Tok - @ $22.95.  2 stars. Ordered level 10, not spicy and an overly lemongrass flavor. Didn't taste well seasoned but cooked perfectly.\n* Prim Nook - @ $11.95. 1.5 stars. Excited to try this, totally disappointed. This was bland, even at spice level 7 and just tasted like  can of mashed hatch chilis. \n* Pepper garlic sauce with shrimp - @ $13.95. 4.5 stars. Best dish of the night for me, I will be dreaming about that sauce until I get back to vegas. \n* Spicy catfish with basil leaves - @ $14.95. 4 stars. Catfish have a wonderful crunch and a great spicy sauce.\n* Moo Yang @ 14.95. 3.5 stars. This was a nice dish and definitely a better choice for the kids than the chicken rama. The pork was tender and nicely cooked. The spicy sauce on the side, delicious. \n* Mango with sticky rice @ $8.95. 3.75 stars. Rice was warm, delicious, mango was sweet but a little bit brown around the edges. A bit expensive.\n     We love trying new dishes every time we come and some are hits, some misses. Lotus excels in their sauces and curries especially and has a menu of items you can't find most places.  The portions are pretty modest. I don't have that big of an appetite and could easily eat 2 dishes myself. Also, the pricing is a bit wonky to me, some items are well priced others not so.  Relative to most good Las Vegas restaurants, the expensive items are really not that expensive though. Lotus' reputation is earned with good reason."

            "review": "I told a coworker of mine that my husband and I were headed to Vegas and we would be doing some touristy things the first day and would have a car. She immediately pointed me in the direction of Lotus of Siam. She said it was an amazing Thai place and that if we had a car we should definitely check it out. I followed her advice and was so happy I did! My husband, who isn't the hugest fan of Thai, and I both enjoyed the meal we had. We ordered more than we could eat (and without having a fridge in our hotel room, we couldn't take any leftovers with us) and we were both very satisfied with our choices.\n\nI will say that I was at first very intimated by the menu. It's more than 10-pages long with a list of your standard curries, in addition to the numerous traditional dishes, plus dishes from different regions of Thailand, add to that a page or more of noodle dishes, salads, appetizers, etc.. - It is enormous! It took us a while, but we finally decided on 3 dishes we had never tried before: Spicy Shrimp Salad, Catfish red curry (without coconut milk), and a Thai-style sausage. We also ordered Pad Thai as sort of a \"control\" dish (something we're both familiar with). They have an huge (and rather impressive) wine list, but neither of us really think about pairing Thai with wine, so we stuck with beer (Singha) instead. \n\nFirst, the sausage was delicious. It was a country-style sausage, with big pieces of meat and fat in natural casing, simply seared and served with spears of fresh ginger, a few tiny (but VERY spicy) chili peppers, fresh cabbage, and toasted peanuts. Both of us were really taken by surprised at how flavorful the sausage was. There was a tart/sour almost citrus-y taste to the meat, like it had been pickled or brined before being chopped/ground and stuffed into its casing. This actually allowed the sausage to taste less dense than it was (it was a dry sausage, more meat than fat, and the citrus or whatever sour note cut through the meat). Taking a bite of the fresh ginger with a slice of sausage made for a perfect combo. This was, overall, our favorite dish.\n\nThe catfish curry was very good, although it was similar to other red curries I've tried. I had never had curry with catfish and the fish was fresh and nicely cooked (not under-cooked and certainly not overcooked). Unfortunately, the zucchini was rather mushy, even though the green beans were al dente. It had a nice heat and the flavor was there. Honestly, this was just OK compared to everything else.\n\nThe Spicy Shrimp Salad was surprisingly good and spicy. The shrimp were just this side of cooked, so still a little soft but completely cooked through, and they were huge. They were tossed with a chunky salad dressing of kaffir leaf, fish sauce, soy sauce, basil, chili peppers and probably some tamarind, plus a number of other things I couldn't quite pick out. This was all presented on a bed of roughly chopped Romaine lettuce. I could've done with smaller pieces of lettuce, as they were huge and rib-y compared to the shrimp and dressing. Ultimately, it was very good and something I would have never thought to order. I wish it was served earlier than the other dishes, more like a salad/appetizer course, rather than the last thing brought to the table.\n\nLastly, our \"control\" dish of the Pad Thai was a welcome comfort. It was actually the best Pad Thai I've ever had before. The balance of savory, sweet, sour, and salty was perfect. The noodles were cooked well and the add-ins of sprouts, chicken, and peppers were all nicely incorporated. There was a depth of flavor in their Pad Thai that really made the dish stand out from the rest and I really wish I had more room in my stomach to eat more of it.\n\nThe price for each of our dishes was comparable to other Thai restaurants at home. I'm surprised at the number of comments by other Yelpers about the portion size. I thought the portions were all easily shared by two people, possibly three. Believe me, neither my husband nor I starved that night! \n\nThe service was fine, not stellar, but we certainly were not ignored or forgotten, despite being seated in the small room just off the main dining room. The decor was shabby, yes, and it definitely could use some TLC. It's at least clean. Situated in a run-down strip mall a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd., it's as opposite of The Strip as it can be, but the food, I would say, is up there on the same level with the $50/plate restaurants in the resorts. If we hadn't had other dinner plans during our trip, I would've made another stop here to try more dishes!"

The medium spicy was actually a little on the spicier side which makes me shudder to think of what their spicy is....\n\nI do, however, highly recommend the Panang short ribs. Less impressed by the garlic prawns. The tom kha gai soup was good but not the best."

Come to find out they are booked out about 3 weeks for dinner reservations. Definitely go for lunch! They open at 11:30am and if you get there before noon you probably won't have to wait. We took a cab from the middle of the strip to the restaurant before flying out (cab ride was about $20) for lunch. We were in and out of the restaurant in a half hour! Service was incredibly efficient and nice; after ordering, the food came out in about 5 minutes. As many other people said, the portions are a bit smaller than other Thai/Chinese restaurants but the quality is incredible. We had chicken pad thai and chicken panang (curry) and both were incredible. Hands down both dishes were the best we had ever had. I ordered the curry as a '6' on a scale of 1-10 of spiciness and it was delicious!"

Once I had to continually ask the hostess if we were still on the list and I was afraid to step outside because I just thought I would lose our place in line. While they were busy, I felt ignored that time; it is always nice to get an update when you have to wait a while. Also, there is no real place to wait inside.\n\nAs for the food: Definitely worth the wait. Lots of options and good dishes to share. Traditional and unique dishes for this Thai gem."

It's not a secret, this place.\n\nThe only flaw - a minor one in the scheme of things - is that the prices were a bit high for the amount of food ordered. The portions are quite modest. You will need to order at least one entree per adult and possibly more.\n\nIs this the best Thai I've ever eaten? I don't know - it was pretty darn good. And a lot of the dishes simply aren't available at your nearest Thai joint.

            "review": "The phrase, \"location, location, location\", goes out the door when a restaurant becomes a \"Destination.\" Lotus of Siam is definitely a \"destination restaurant.\" Located in one of Vegas's more depressed and delapidated business centers, Lotus of Siam's offerings of very traditional Thai cuisine, and service, have become the reason for local celeb's, and tour groups, to travel to this unassuming location. While I just can't proclaim this or any spot as the \"Best Thai Food\" in the US...  given that this is \"Vegas Baby\"..... Lotus of Siam is a real find. And in fact, if this operation were in a major hotel, it would probably be the star attraction... especially given my lowered opinion, over the years, of Vegas Strip restaurants.\n\nWhen my business associate and I arrived at Lotus this past Wednesday evening, around 6pm, I noticed the taxis dropping off clients. He noticed the \"tour bus\" stopping right in front of the restaurant, behind the taxis. His first words? \"Let's book it and get in before they unload!\" We quickly realized after entering that there are two dining rooms. It appeared busloads, and groups, are seated in the second dining room, where they're set up for larger groups. We had nothing to worry about.\n\nMy thanks to Anita L., Irvine, for contributing her review to the line-up. After our first exhibit day, Wednesday, at a trade show in the Rio, I was thinking of how to follow up our Tuesday setup day. Tuesday found us \"dinnering\" at Memphis Championship BBQ in Henderson. It's one of my \"regular stops\" when in town. But for something different, I typed in \"Thai\", and at the top of the list was Lotus. Anita's one of my yelp-buds, and I respect her opinion. And with Thai cuisine, and for me, anyone who's visited or lived \"in-country\" certainly would have a \"Thai Standard.\"\n\nFollowing Anita's review comments about \"traditional cuisine...\", I decided to see if I could replicate my taste experiences when I lived in a Lao-Thai village in Ubon, circa late 60's. For our table of two, I ordered the papaya salad, chicken satay, soft spring rolls, sticky rice, lard na (noodles) with beef, and yellow-coconut curry with chicken. Add to that a total of four Thai iced teas. (I make them at home!) It was a very good meal. The food actually did remind me of the food I ate in Thailand. I have to say that even the wait-staff's level and type of service was typical to any nice restaurant I've ever visited in Thailand.\n\nIf you're thinking \"Thai\" in town, and to join in the cheer..... I'm voting Lotus of Siam  a \"Best Bet in Vegas.\" And evidently, Louis Anderson, an entertainer who by \"form\" exhibits that he knows good food, thinks so too! Our table was directly under his signed photo with the owner. I'm sure this was one time that he... \"...wasn't kidding!\"   :-))"

            "review": "According to my friends, Lotus of Siam is ranked as \"the BEST Thai Restaurant in America.\"  I'm not really sure who's ranking system this is, but I would declare Lotus of Siam \"the best AUTHENTIC Thai Restaurant in America\" (based on my non-encompassing Thai restaurant experiences).  Unlike a lot of other hyped-up restaurants that I have visited, LoS does provide freshly-made, high-quality, and unique Thai foods that you will not be able to find @ 99% of the general Thai restaurants out there.  Apparently, Pad Thai,  Pad See-ew, and Thai Iced Tea are not the best representation of Thai cuisine :P  \n\nSo before you jump for joy about possibly eating the best Thai food you'll ever eat again, make sure you prepare yourself for a few.....surprises. First, LoS is located in probably one of the slummiest parts of Vegas; there isn't a strip club next door, but there are numerous sex and fetish shops across the street and just down the block. I don't recommend taking little Tommy and exploring the area before & after dinner....you may be opening the door to too many unnecessary questions.  Next, the wait time @ LoS during dinner hours on the weekend is going to be LONG.  For some reason, they don't allow reservations (guess they're so popular that they can demand such unreasonable policies).  Our table of 10 had to wait 1hr and 45 minutes, which we ended up killing at the pool table next door (**warning, it is a very divey, local pool point that's musty, dark, smokey, and seems as though everyone is selling crack or selling themselves***)\n\nSo once you get past the exterior facades and downsides, LoS will undoubtedly provide you a unique Thai dining experience that you shall not find elsewhere in Vegas and most areas.  Their menu is about 10 pages long, and these are all separated into rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, chef's specialities, and then even a \"recommended\" dishes.   I was lucky enough to go with such a large group that we ordered over 10 dishes and got to sample a wide variety of dishes. \n\nI can assert that their rice dishes are very....normal and not-special, but their noodle dishes and specialty dishes were worth the price of admission.  Their  shrimp fried rice was actually below-average (or lacked MSG lol).   If you are a fan of fish, ask for their steamed fish that is fresh and super flavorful & tender.  Spiciness was not an issue for most dishes unless you request the \"Thai spicy\" vs \"American spicy\"   Another memorable dish was the boneless beef ribs, which were great except you only get FOUR small little ribs.  So yes, we split that amongst 10 people through some surgical precision with our butter knife.   Finally, the other dish I remembered was their curry.  It was flavorful, not too rich or thick, and the added meat & veggies was definitely a good complement.  \n\nLastly, the service provided was excellent, the waiter was actually useful in suggesting good dishes, and he also seemed like a \"happy\" employee who was proud of working @ \"the best Thai restaurant in America.\" He even boasted that they had recently filmed a Top Chef episode in Vegas the week before.  Next time, I shall go again and try some newer dishes and provide an update.  Til then, I better not find another Thai restaurant anointed as \"best Thai restaurant in the World/Galaxy/Universe\" or else i'll have to reevaluate my current review :P"

But as we saw people waiting around in the front for it to open....and asian, this was our good sign. It was like the moment Dorothy opened the front door to her house and stepped into Oz. They had seemed to done up the place really well and you really wouldn't have imagined it at its location.\n\nIt was pretty interesting as we sat down and literally had to flip through seven pages of the menu and absolutely had no idea what to order. The waiters were definitely honest with their suggestions. Their recommendations turned out to be some of the most unique flavors and tastes I've ever experienced.  I'm thinking that part of the reason why their food is so delicious is because they utilize their different flavors, textures, and consistencies so successfully.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nNam Kao Tod\nGreen Tofu Curry \nSai Oua (Northern Style Sausage)\nDrunken Noodles with Chicken\nNam Prik Ong with Sticky Rice (Red Chili Dip)\nCoconut Ice cream with Fried Bananas \n\nAmongst my uncle, cousin and myself, it was definitely way too difficult to rank our favorites; and we kept adding on to our tab because it's one of those places where you want to literally try everything on the menu.\n\nWe also kept hearing people mention that they had redone the place, maybe for more room to hang their awards and pictures of celebrities.\n\nChances of coming back?

The duck was perfectly fried and the Panang curry was perfectly seasoned. \n\nWe got free dessert as well! It was fried bananas!! And a lot of them! It was soooo so soo good. Literally the best fried bananas I've ever had. \n\nI really hope to come back one day!"

Water was always filled and I didn't have to raise my hand for too long if I needed something. Bae and I came here without a reservation on a Saturday (they only serve dinner at 5:30pm on weekends) and sat in a line for maybe 8min at most.\n\nFood\n- garlic prawns. \nWhat is there to say ? Incredibly flavorful, buttery and garlicky and I don't even know what else I'm eating but I just know my tongue is super happy. Bae and I got maybe 8 prawns and we still had leftovers\n- boat noodle soup (combination beef noodle soup/#109)\nHoly this is prolly my fav thing here other than the prawns. So incredibly flavorful and it almost makes me cry from whatever flavors my tongue is experiencing. Kicks my hometown Thai place's boat noodle soup out of the water. Honestly this doesn't even need the vermicelli noodles. If you get this with the beef and the bean sprouts, in combination with the amazing broth, you won't even miss the noodles. Get this.\n- khao soi\nEgg noodles in a light curry sauce with beef topped with crispy egg noodles. This was a tad hair shorter in the flavor department compared to the boat noodle soup, but with a squeeze of lime, it elevated the flavor tenfold. Pretty good, kind of a small portion.\n- nam kao tod (crispy fried rice)\nIf you're looking for a flavor explosion with a bit of a crunch, I'd recommend this. Filled with crispy rice (how do they do it...), peanuts, a healthy dose of lime, sour pork sausage, red onions, I'm sure fish sauce, peanuts and other stuff, this is a party in your mouth. Compared to Vientiane (garden grove), this place stands it's ground for crispy rice. Bae kept looking up and pondering how this made his tastebuds flip.\n- mango sticky rice\nI love sticky rice and bae has never had mango sticky rice, so this was perfect. The rice seemed a little hard (chewier) than other ones I had, but it also had a fragrant jasmine taste to it. The mangoes were the small ones and it was an ample amount. Sweet and yummy, bae ate the whole thing."

They even said our orders would be placed first and indeed it was; we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and the bill was brought during the end of our meal which was excellent since we had a show to see.\n\nThe food was excellent, i had duck curry at spice level for 1/10 which is mild to medium spice for an average person. last time I was here i got 5 which is basically insanely hot so I recommend going low if you haven't been here before. This is considered the best Thai restaurant in ALL OF NORTH AMERICA by numerous magazines and it definitely lives up to the hype.\n\n*The show we went to see was Penn & Teller at the Rio and that was a great show. 5 Stars."

We were able to get by since a bunch of us were still quite full from our lunch earlier in the day. But, if we were ravishing starving, I hardly think an order of each, sans the fried catfish would be enough for us. \n\nThe pad thai looked different from the normal pad thai I'm used to eating. They use a thinner clearer noodle and a darker sauce. It looked like it was severely stirred fried. Still had the pad thai taste and I enjoyed it very much. Just wished that there was much more of it. This was the tiniest of the entree's. \n\nThe star of the show was our fried catfish. It was huge! We got several beady eye looks once it arrived to our table. Besides the great appearance, it didn't disappoint! It was fresh, meaty, and crispy to perfection! \n\nThe service in the beginning was a bit slow, but once we ordered, it got better. They had a person dedicated to just refilling water and he was dam good at it, too! Never did we have an empty glass. \n\nI would definitely return to this Thai establishment.

I had the Panang Curry (at an 8, which was perfect) with noodles and my husband had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since.\n\nThe food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant.

Since I rarely wander off the Strip, I managed to miss it on every trip until a couple months back, when I made the trip with a few friends.\n\nWe booked well in advance, but were able to change a table for 3 to a table for 5 the day of our dinner. Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Monday, so probably not a peak time, though the place was very busy the whole time we were there. (You can also walk in, apparently, but it sounds like the waits get long.) The restaurant was in a huge strip mall, with the kind of parking lot ideal for teaching teens to drive, or testing specially modified DeLoreans. The space itself was comfortable--not small for a family-run Thai restaurant in the desert, but not big for what could be Vegas's most hyped off-Strip attraction.\n\nI liked the atmosphere, which was homey but upbeat, with tons of accolades and celebrity photos on the wall (though the only person I recognized was Asian fiend Nick Cage). Ah, the bald boastfulness of accomplished immigrants--I know it well. Service was good, fast and attentive, even as a crowd of dishes created near chaos on our table.\n\nThe food was excellent, every bite loaded to bursting with flavor. We ordered a family style feast, and everything was delicious and satisfying in that way that makes you wonder, why eat at fancy restaurants when Thai food is just better? Lotus of Siam outshines most restaurants on the Strip, and its price point is a lot more friendly.\n\nThe moo yang was irresistible, a plate of marinated charbroiled pork, tenderly chewy with a caramelized char, served with a homemade spicy dipping sauce. The papaya salad was classic--green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed peanuts, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar--and nicely executed, made with a ton of heat. One of Lotus of Siam's signature dishes, which I'd never had anywhere else, was the garlic prawn. I can see why people talk come here for this--it was utterly addictive, deep fried prawns saute\u00e9d in a house garlic sauce and topped with ground black pepper. Tons of flavor, and a flaky, chip-like texture. I don't tend to love prawn shells, but these were put to beautiful use.\n\nThe bulk of our meal came in the form of curries and carbs. The khao soi was another house specialty--crispy duck on egg noodles in a curry-based sauce, garnished with scallions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This was spectacular, somewhere between a noodle soup and a curry, with a thick, complex sauce that was thin enough to eat by the spoonful. I also loved the kang hung lay, a spicy stewy Northern pork curry. The portion was small, but the contents were rich, the pork cooked so tender it was falling apart in the curry. On the more everyday Thai side of things, I really enjoyed the panang curry with chicken, and the pineapple fried rice was solid.\n\nThe check came before we could order dessert--it's possible our server thought we'd had quite enough, which wasn't inaccurate. There's always next time--now that I've been to Lotus of Siam, I'll drag people off the Strip to go back."

Surely the most 'famous' restaurant in Las Vegas and debatably the most well-known place for Thai in the United States the nondescript strip-mall location on Sahara Ave had always been on my \"to visit\" list and although my heat tolerance is still quite novice what I found at LoS was well within my comfort zone and aside from the nearly ninety minute wait for a seat and perfunctory service all of it was really quite delicious.\n\nFortunate to visit on a day when Chef Saipin was in the kitchen and the crowd was largely local our table of three tried as best we could to sample a wide but manageable amount of food from various areas of the immense menu and deferring once or twice to our server, Pha, we requested items arrive in a couple of courses as opposed to all at once; a request honored leading to seven plates in three rounds, each plate nicely presented, piping hot, and all but the Beef Ball soup full of flavor.\n\nBeginning first with savory fish cakes aromatic and spicy, prawns snappy and fresh with dipping sauce far sweeter than sour, and crispy rice with citrus proving an admirable foil to funky sausage the meal began with a bang only to falter slightly in the second round where the seafood shined while the aforementioned soup fell flat and the duck, advertised as crispy, was actually rather limp but quite delicious as the garlicky noodles, laden with fish sauce, provided needed balance to the substantial heat.  Last, largely because the kitchen forgot we ordered it until we inquired, but certainly not least - the Mussel Omelet arrived resembling a savory funnel cake - a slight sweetness beneath the brine and along with the Nam Kao Tod and Hoh Mok evidence to me that any subsequent trip to Lotus of Siam would see me focus even more strongly on seafood - particularly the snapper and catfish - while also taking a look at the Northern Thai menu."

I wanted some chicken with basil and a green curry. Both were very good. Neither changed my worldview. Future sister-in-law couldn't remember what Thai dishes she liked. Her future husband remembered and ordered for her. That's why they're married now.\n\nSo if all you know about Trinidad is that Obama just visited there, you might not know that Trinis love spicy food. S-i-l's father makes his own hot sauce every two weeks because he uses so much of it. He loved the food here. S-i-l's cousin couldn't stand the spice in his cup of soup. This is why when the server asks you how spicy you want your food, you have to pay attention and not try to impress anyone. Our server (who may very well have been the owner) tried very hard to please a table full of people most of whom had never eaten Thai food before. She largely succeeded.\n\nSo my recommendation would be to come to Lotus of Siam if you like Thai food, if you're interested in dishes that you can't get in most other restaurants, or if you like really spicy food. If you're a Thai fan, order one thing you would normally get, and then branch out to one thing on the menu that sounds good but you've never tried. If you throw in some appetizers, you'll certainly not go home hungry. I was stuffed, and wished I had ordered something besides my usuals.\n\nReservations are important, especially for large parties. The decor is not fancy, although there are enough celebrity photographs on the walls to make you thing you're in the Pink's in Los Angeles."

I ate there a few times with my wife (we are both vegans). There were lots of vegetarian options, but it was very hit and miss. Some food was actually pretty good, and some very boring. Probably the worse was the \"Thai salad\": Note to staff, just putting peanut sauce on iceberg lettuce does not make it Thai.  \n\nThe staff were very friendly, but you really get a sense that you have to fit the rhythms of the restaurant. We went in at 9pm one night (kitchen closes at 9.30pm - at least during weekdays) and the last half of our meal was punctuated with the sounds of the vacuum cleaner (this also happened on another occasion when we in the last part of lunch). Really it is difficult to have a peaceful meal and enjoy your food when people are making a huge noise while you are trying to eat. Also the lighting is really harsh at night. Much calmer for lunch than dinner. Spicing is on a 1:10 scale and be aware that 10 is v. hot.\n\nIt is a big relief to be off the Strip though so we went back and the food was OK if not too great. It's about $12-$15 cab ride from the Strip.  Prices are reasonable.\n\nBottom line: nice place for a quiet lunch, but don't go with huge expectations."

I saw the raving reviews here and with all the celebrities they have posters on the wall you'd think it was the best Thai food outside of Thailand.  \n\nI ordered a cup of Tom Yum Kai and found the chicken to be dry.  The taste was good and light so I suppose that was a plus.  My husband and I decided to order our usual at all Thai restaurants to do a comparison: Panang Curry with chicken and Phad Se-ew with beef.  The panang curry had to have been the worst I've had.  It had only the flavor of coconut milk with no real flavor of curry, dry chicken again and only sliced red peppers.  Did someone forget to add curry powder in it?  The Phad Se-ew was pretty good but still had it better in Manhattan with more flavor. \n\nCustomer service wasn't the greatest either.  The waiter didn't come to our table for a good 15-20 minutes and it took him awhile to bring our check after we were done eating.  Never checked on us while we ate.  Maybe we didn't order their signature shrimp dish but these other normal offerings should've been stellar if it is a good restaurant."

I also happened to love the owner of this restaurant. An older women who is involved in every aspect of her restaurant. I loved the way she would step out of the kitchen to check to see if everyone was enjoying the food and atmosphere. I even saw her washing drinking glasses, now that is one humble lady. I'm also assuming she has not opened another location due to the fact that she can't be at two places at the same time! Asian business lady, I salute you!

The interior was larger than I expected it to be. It is located in a plaza off the strip.I was told this was deemed the best Thai food in the entire nation and that Anthony Bourdain recommended not getting Pad Thai here. This place is known for their northern Thai dishes so I made sure to try many of those. I tried:\n\n1. pad see ew \n2. drunken noodles\n3. salty Thai lemonade \n4. Northern larb (ground pork with lime juice)\n5. panang curry (delicious!)\n6. nam prik noom (green chili dip)- super spicy, this was our least favorite dish. It was just a dip with a side of vegetables to dip into the green spicy sauce\n7. crab fried rice (the best I've ever had!)\n8. nua nam tok - sliced beef with lime juice \n9. prawns with super spicy green chili lime sauce on a bed of cabbage - this dish was way too sour for me but my friends loved it \n\nThey charge for their regular rice but I didn't mind because their rice was delicious! It was gluttonous and soft. I could eat rice and curry all day. Serving sizes here are small so I would recommend ordering 1-2 dishes more than the number of heads in your party. Mango isn't in season right now so we didn't get to try the mango sticky rice dessert. Everything was super spicy despite being described as a 4 out of 10. Our meal ended up being around $25-28 per person."

I wanted to try it all!\n\nWe ordered:\n1. #56 NUA SAO RENU Sliced charbroiled beef served on beds of sliced cabbages, topped with our homemade tamarind sauce and fried dry chili. $17.95\n2. #39 SOM THUM [Thai Papaya Salad]  green papaya, chili, tomato, crushed\npeanuts mixed with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar. $8.95\n3. GARLIC PRAWNS Deep fried prawns with shellls (almost like potato chips), saut\u00e9ed with our special garlic sauce, topped with ground black pepper. $26.95\n4. CRISPY DUCK DRUNKEN NOODLE Crispy duck topped with fresh homemade chili and Thai basils. Served on the top of pan fried flat rice noodles. $25.95\n5. Fried banana dessert $8 plus coconut ice cream $4. These two go together heavenly, but the star really was the coconut ice cream.\n6. Thai iced tea x 4.  The Thai tea here is really good. Not over sweet like other Thai restaurants. The tea flavor really comes through.\n\n\nPros:\n1. Delicious food. Everything we ordered was really good and I would order again.\n2. Lot of variety on the menu. Especially Northern Thai dishes\n3. Fresh ingredients. You can taste the quality.\n\nCons:\n1. Pricey for Thai food, 4 dishes + 4 thai teas = $110 after tax, before tip. Yikes.\n2. Can be a long wait depending on what time you go\n\nVerdict: Totally worth it! The food here is amazing. It's a must visit restaurant on my Vegas list.\n\nPro-tips:  \n1. GO STRAIGHT TO THE BACK OF THE MENU TO TRY THE NORTHERN THAI DISHES \n2. Go with a bigger group if you want to try more dishes!\n3. Beware of the spiciness levels! Thai spicy is no joke! We got level 2 and it was pretty spicy for me and I'm usually great about handling spicy foods."

The downside is you end up spending more on wine than food ($120 for 2 people, including tip, at a restaurant where the average entree is $10. Huh???!).  I had drunken noodles with sea bass, which is apparently 3x as much as the drunken noodles on the menu.  Still though, the fish was fresh and delicious and the dish was great.   The beef jerky appetizer was nicely flavored but almost too tough to get my teeth through, however.  Finished the meal with an egg roll banana with  coconut of sorts, which was a nice light way to conclude.\n\nWill go back here again, for sure!  The parking lot is sketchy, the strip mall is a dump, and the place itself wins no marks for decor.  But the food is great and attention to detail with serious wine is much appreciated (including by Robert Parker, who reviewed the place).  Although I'll probably order one of the cheaper $9 dishes.  Oh, and I dropped in on a Saturday night around 8 pm and had no problem getting a table.\n\n***Updating my review after making 3 trips in total out here.***\n\nSo some of the dishes are quite average, the panang curry was pretty blah and bland, and the service can be so horrendous that you wonder if anyone is running the show.  The cashew chicken dish is just ok but again, about what I'd expect at an average Thai restaurant.  These people are seriously confused.  Lunchtime is a completely different scene (a 2-star one) compared to dinner (4 stars).  So I have to downgrade this place, seeing as I am very stingy with 5 stars and I wish more people would be."

Would def recommend this. Garlic prawns were also amazing. It's cut in half, with the meat curling out, but you can eat the rest of it as well (the shell). Deep fried, so it tastes like some kind of shrimp crackers. Dry (no sauce) but the flavor is bomb.\n\nThe ginger Chilean sea bass was cooked really well, but the sauce was a little lacking. Nothing special :/ The tom yum soup can get pretty spicy, so if you can't handle spicy too well, I wouldn't recommend more than a 5/10 haha. \n\nService was also not too bad considering they seemed a little understaffed when I was there. Side note.. workers in white clothes aren't waiters, they just help with cleaning and serving.\n\nAll in all, great food at a great price!!

            "review": "(Devin is my boyfriend, parents are obviously my parents)\n\nOn Saturday, Devin and I took my parents to Lotus of Siam. We have been in a bowling league with most of the waitstaff for about a year now, and we've been meaning to go there. When an article about this year's James Beard award floated my way, I noticed that among the nominees, which included the Chefs from Joel Robuchon and Rick Moonen, was the Chef from Lotus of Siam. That sealed the deal; we had to go there as soon as possible.\n\nThe restaurant is easy to drive right by; there's a sign on what looks like a warehouse on Sahara, just east of the Strip. Never fear; the entrance is on the other side, and the ambiance is nice. We didn't have reservations but got in at 7PM on a Saturday night with no problem. The crowd started showing up at 8, so I would recommend reservations for a later meal.\n\nThe wine list is huge, but since I didn't know what I was planning on eating, I just ordered a beer. They have both Singha and Chang beer from Thailand. The menu is similarly huge, probably ten pages of dishes conveniently numbered so you don't have to fumble through pronunciations if you aren't used to ordering Thai food.\n\nI started with the Tom Yum Kai soup, which is my favorite thing to eat at Thai restaurants. I asked for it hot-spicy. Heed my warning: If you're at all nervous about your heat threshold, go for medium-spicy. I love really spicy food, so I thought the soup was great. I also ordered the Spicy Catfish. It was thin filets of fish battered and fried, with a delicious sauce, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even had leftovers since we ordered so many other dishes.\n\nOther things ordered were the stuffed chicken wings appetizer, the chicken satay with peanut sauce, and the jackfruit dish, which was, I believe, mashed jackfruit, pork, and herbs in a spicy sauce. That one was delicious, as was everything else. My Dad ordered a salmon dish, which he said was really great. I believe it because there was absolutely nothing left on his plate when he was done, and the man knows his salmon. Devin ordered the Pad Thai, which was probably the best I've ever had. The noodles were very thin compared to the rice stick noodles that are usually used for Pad Thai, and it was also hot enough to excite my spice-seeking palate, even when ordered at medium-spicy.\n\nThen came dessert. One of my favorite things in the world is sticky rice with mango, so we ordered that. They put a dessert platter together for us that included the rice, mango, some coconut ice cream, and some fried bananas. They do their fried bananas in phyllo dough, which is something I'd never seen before, and I loved it. Do not skip dessert, even if it means taking some of your main course home like we did.\n\nThe service was excellent, and I'm not just saying that because our waiter was one of our bowling buddies. They were attentive, and when we asked to take about five different things home, they took the plates away and boxed everything separately for us. Most impressive and refreshing: My Dad asked the waiter what he should order from two choices, and the waiter honestly told him which dish he liked better (the salmon), instead of pulling the, \"Well, they're both good...\" junk that waitstaff usually gives you when you ask for a recommendation.\n\nI thought the price was incredible considering how much food we had. Including food, drinks, dessert, and two hours of just fun eating, we walked out at less than $40 a person. Parking is convenient, abundant, and free.\n\nI can see why people call this place the best Thai restaurant in America. It's the best one that I've been to. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this restaurant."

Even on a Tuesday nite, it was packed and we had to wait for half a hour w/o reservations.  We tried the crispy rice as an appetizer and the green curry w/ chicken and drunken noodles w/ seafood.  The crispy rice had a nice texture but was unimaginably overseasoned.  I think they may have emptied the whole salt shaker by accident.  The green curry was pretty good but small in portions.  The drunken noodles was the highlight of the meal with yummy fresh seafood and greasy good noodles.  I'm giving one free pass for the overseasoned appetizer until my next visit.  A good place to go away from the strip but I recommend calling for reservations first."

            "review": "I have to disagree with most reviews.  Lotus of Siam is a cult restaurant that definitely offers unique tastes but is not the best Thai in the country and may not even be the Thai in the Commercial Center.\n\nBy the way, although the Commercial Center is still an iffy place at night, a local business group has been trying to turn this around.\n\nSome reviewers must be judging this by their uniqueness.  I can understand if someone is jaded, they will find this an adventure but quite frankly its not that great.  Their duck curry is too sweet and their spicy sausage dish is way too acidic.  It appears to have flecks of ham in it instead of sausage but only the taste not description matters.\n\nI think that their abililty to pair wines with the food must account for some of their esteem by some food critics.  They do have a good selection and the husband of the chef is not bad at wine recommendations.  One of my friends in New York who was knocked on her heels by Michelin's star for Devi told me this is sometimes a factor.  \n\nHowever, there are at least 2 Thai restaurants in Vegas that I am sure most would find superior to LOS:  Pin Kaow and Archi with Komol not far behind.  Komol is in the same seedy center as LOS.  \n\nThis review is not based on their buffet which is not as bad as most reviews but a definite step below their regular menu.  I have eaten there 3 times, exhortations from visitors driven and have always been underwhelmed.  \n\nYes, their flavorings are unique but is it good?  Is it as good as some of the other Thais in Las Vegas.  I'm sorry but no it is not."

I can eat this all day... it's so good that even the shell of the shrimp, u can eat it. the beef fried rice is ok. little bit oily! the dining area is ok. old fashioned typical Asian resto. their walls are filled with pictures of celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and Nicolas cage to name a few! they have a wine cellar inside.. it looks clean. kitchen is busy! fast service.. eat and go kinda of thing. the servers doesn't really say anything unless u order something. I felt rushed when we came coz we're waiting for some more people to come, they look like they are worried that ur gonna stay there for an hour! overall, good food but very pricey! for 5 dishes including 1 dessert and 3 Thai iced tea, our bill is a whopping 150$... I'm not even full.. but tasty! so 4 stars!!!"

Lotus of Siam has amazing food and a wine selection to rival most fine Italian restaurants and steakhouses. \n\nMy husband and I first dined here in March of this year. He had heard about it on Yelp and all the reviews said to try the buffet. Unfortunately it's just a lunchtime buffet and we had missed it for the day, so we ordered off the menu. We were not disappointed. Our server suggested the Drunken Noodle Prawns and we also ordered Pad Prik King chicken. Both were outstanding. Our server was friendly and attentive and the restaurant was very clean. We had a wonderful Italian red wine with our meal that made it absolutely perfect.\n\nToday we had the opportunity to try the lunch buffet. It's $10.99 and served from 11:30-2:30. While there aren't a whole lot of items on the buffet, the dishes they have are fantastic. Drunken Noodles, Green Curry Chicken, and Pad Thai were my favorites. The Chow Mein, not something I would normally order, was also very good. We tried the two Thai beers and both were quite good. \n\nI have nothing but praise for Lotus of Siam. I've added it to the list of places I have to visit when in Vegas."

I put my name on the waiting list and was told it would be a 25 minute wait and that I could wait at the Bar. When I went to the bar all the seats were taken as well so I had no choice but to wait outside the restaurant. Luckily, it wasn't very busy that night and I only had to wait for 15 minutes for a party of 2. BEWARE usually it's about a 2 hour wait. \n\nI ordered the Nam Kao Tod which is a crispy rice that's quite sour tasting. In my opinion it was a little too sour for a rice dish. \n\nNext I had the coconut chicken soup (Tom Kah Kai) and it tasted like coconut milk mixed with chile oil. It was sweet so it seemed like a dessert but it had chicken and mushrooms which also made the dish savory. This mixture was a bit too odd for me and I would definitely not order this dish again. \n\nThe Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab was also pretty disappointing considering the price. It was 18.95 with a small plate of noodles with a sprinkle of soft shell crab legs. Out of all the dishes I ordered I only liked the Musaman curry which was OK. \n\nIf you came here on a busy night and had to wait longer than 30 minutes I would recommend not coming here considering the price. If you do decide to wait it out DON'T order the Nam Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, and Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab.\n\nOverall the service was good, the items I ordered were pretty bad with the exception of the Musamam curry, and I would probably not come here again."

Waiter was really informative and corrected my Indonesian pronunciation of \"Panang\" which I guess I was supposed to be right since it's based on the Malay language but they said it \"Paenaeng\".

Lamb was too rare for my taste but I loved the tenderness and the sauce. Ordered crispy duck in panang sauce and friends loved it but I was ok with the duck honestly -- not as crispy as I thought it would be, but perhaps that's cos it took me a few minutes before getting to it. Also ordered special of the day seafood hot and sour soup. It was awesome except that the crab was all skin and hard to get the meat. The sauce was perfection tho and I became obsessed to research northern Thai food now! WOOOOOOO can't wait to try cooking these curry sauces! @.@\n\nAlways make a reservation. Reservation is hard to get and Sunday is more crowded than Saturday.

The area didn't exactly look promising, but once we saw the crowd inside, we knew something was up. We knew we were about to have an awesome meal.\n\nFood - We started with the Nam Kao Tod, which is Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. The spiciness was perfect, although too much for my spice-sensitive gf, but she still enjoyed it enough to brave through it. Yum. 4 out of 5\n\nThen we had the Tom Kha Gai as recommended by the waitress. This is when I knew I had to rave about this place on yelp. The taste was perfect. It was the taste that I would compare all tom kha/yum variations to. Noone else comes close. Seriously. 6 out of 5? lol\n\nOf course, we had to try the Pad Thai. My girlfriend and I always judge the quality of a Thai restaurant based on their pad thai. Why? Because every Thai restaurant has it and it is probably the most popular Thai dish in the US, thus, every Thai restaurant should not only have it, but they better deliver in quality. They did not disappoint. This was the best Pad Thai I've ever had. another 6 out of 5.\n\nService - our waitress was a Thai lady. She practically recommended all of the dishes we ordered and even recommended which spices to use to bring out the flavor even more. Such a sweet lady =] she got a huge tip :P\n\nPrice - It's the price you'd expect to pay at a Thai restaurant.. ;) I'd gladly pay for each dish. Twice.\n\nI need more stars for this place."

If you order the papaya salad make sure to scale how spicy you want it made because it can't get off the charts. Order the garlic prawn, its semi deshelled but the shell is fried crispy enough to eat. It's my favorite dish and so far the best shrimp I have ever had. I been trying to find places in Houston that carries this but so far haven't found on yet. I'm definetly a fan for life. Must try this place if visit Vegas."

The physical space is an odd amalgamation of upscale pretension and church recreation room with a nifty wine cellar thrown in. Maybe this is a hidden gem for \"out of towners\"; but it was certainly packed on a recent Saturday visit. Though the bar area was wide-open.\n\nThe food is awesome - everything I tried was exceptional and worthy of 5 stars. The stuffed chicken wing is the BEST - it is a chicken wing stuffed with pork and deep fried! What's not to love....Other favorites were garlic shrimp (the shells were the best part) and the crispy duck. My dining companion enjoyed her uber large bowl of noodle goodness. Great selection of German Riesling wines with some very rare finds at fair prices. The service is a bit spotty and I had to flag down some one on a few occasions. Let's hope the tourists don't find out about this place and we can keep it our little naughty dining secret.\n\nLooking forward to my next visit to the Lotus of Siam."

If this was my neighborhood Thai restaurant, I wouldn't hesitate being a regular.  But I certainly wouldn't fly across the country to come eat here like I would... say, for Arun's in Chicago. \nAfter my first visit here a couple of months ago, I hesitated in writing a not-so stellar review.  I was puzzled at what the other people were tasting that I wasn't.  The other reason why I was reluctant to write one was 'coz I felt it would be an unfair write-up after only trying mostly their Northern Thai dishes.  Yes, we enjoyed the nam kao tod - minced sour sausage appetizer a lot but everything else paled in comparison to what I expected.  The northern larb was far inferior to the regular larb, and the much acclaimed kung ka noon which is a spicy young jack fruit curry was far from yummy - almost a dish that requires an acquired taste.  \n\nI resisted from writing a two star review then... so today, we returned to order a bunch of food that weren't just what other moronic non-Thai- food-eating-'experts' claimed excellent, but ordered what we normally enjoy.  I feel that following food critics reviews on ethnic food may be a little tricky.  But having gone to Thailand a gazilion times since I was 3, went to cooking school there and grew up around the region, I know what Thai food (in the Bangkok area) should taste like.\n\nToday we ordered the vegetarian egg rolls, tod mun plar (fish cakes), and yum woon seng (seafood glass noodle 'salad') for appetizers; crispy mussel omelette, chicken green curry and pad thai for entree.  Yes, two noodle dishes.  I love my noodles :)  My favorite dish at this meal was the mussel omelette.  It was close to what it should taste like and I enjoyed the nice crunch.  This dish is enjoyed both in Thailand and some other parts of South East Asia (though oysters are often used - minus the crispy part).  The green curry, I felt, lack flavor and spice even though we asked for very spicy (7 out of 10 for spice).  DO NOT order the pad thai here.  It is NOT what pad thai should taste nor look like.  We make much better pad thai at home lol!  \n\nIt was a good meal.  I walked out pretty contented with my Thai food craving.  Service was pleasant and friendly as was our first time dining here.   I just couldn't figure out what the lady was saying 80% of the time so I just agreed and smiled :D"

We had  crispy rice appetizer and I must say it was fragrant and crunch and wonderful spicy (we chose mild).  The dish was a bit salty and the vegetables were great is perfect to offset it's saltiness - I just wish there was more vegetables to go with this dish.   I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup (I didn't specify and was quite spicy).  My wife had the Drunken Seafood Noodle (she wanted it mild) the taste of basil with the seafood is very good.  I suggest going with mild if it is your first time there.  Waiters are very attentive, friendly, and will answer any questions you may have.

It is hard to find because the restaurant is not facing the highway. During the day the shopping center almost looks deserted. There is a warning inside the restaurant about vehicle break-ins and not leaving luggage and valuables in plain sight. The first thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is all the articles about the Lotus of Siam. We were seated and waited on quickly. The wine list is amazing, they have one large glass enclosed area with racks of wine. There is another room that also is full of wine. Nine Wine Spectator awards are on the wall. \n\nMy sister's Koong Teen, grilled shrimp with spicy sauce on top of sliced cabbage was tasty. The shrimp were tender and the sauce gave it a kick. I was leery of the raw cabbage but it had sort of a fish sauce that actually turned out to be like an Asian coleslaw. I ordered the Pad Thai and was asked if I wanted it spicy and I said yes. It turned out just right, it made you sweat a little. The garlic prawn and the crispy rice was very flavorful (according to my sister's boyfriend) and had been accompanied .by a very tasty Cucumber Salad. The Panang did have some thing I never had in a curry, grape tomatoes and red grapes. This restaurant is worth a visit if you like Thai food.\n\nPrices are extremely reasonable, a great bargain and a great find in a town with no shortage of over-priced, over-hyped food and drink. When you consider all of the overpriced and overhyped restaurants in the casinos on the strip, this was one experience that we were glad we did not miss. I can't recommend it highly enough."

Finally after visiting, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the food. The service was impeccable, and having worked in a higher end restaurant for several years, I could not find a single flaw. The food doesn't feel like it lives up to the standard of the service. I came a large group of people and we ordered the nine most popular dishes. And I must say that nothing about any of the food stood out.  I couldn't find a flaw with the taste or texture, but nothing about the food captured me. It was a bit of a let down, the food was still good, but everyone I was with felt the same way. Overall I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. If the food matched the service, it would be the best restaurant in the world."

Tell him you want shellfish, or garlic, or duck, or ... Let him know the kind of spice level you tolerate. Then let him recommend dishes. I've never had a dish I didn't like the server recommended. Also, always get the Garlic Prawns. That's just a given. Also get the recommended fish dish. The sea bass they always have is a good starting point, if the server doesn't have anything better."

We were initially going to go to Komol but were swayed by\nthe concierge at the taxi stand after he told us that Lotus of Siam\nwas world famous.  I still am not sure of that distinction but there\nwere pictures of famous people including Mario Batali all around the\nrestaurant with a lady whom I assume is the owner.\n\nWe decided to start off our meals with both the Moo Dad Dea (Pork\nJerky Thai Style) and Golden Tofu.  The tofu was fried perfectly which\ngave it a good texture on the outside that almost made it al dente.\nIt's sweet and sour sauce was nice as well giving the tofu a great\noverall flavor.  The pork jerky was an interesting dish but also good.\n  For some reason it reminded me of some fried pork belly that I had\nenjoyed previously and it was quickly gone between the three meat\neaters at the table.  For my entree I asked the server what the most\npopular dishes in the restaurant were.  He mentioned the crispy duck\nand something else but since I already had been looking at the duck, I\nended up ordering that.  Whenever I was asked how spicy I wanted it on\nscale of 1 to 10, I replied \"Thai Spicy\".  You see in Pittsburgh, Thai\nspicy is somewhere around a 15 or 20 on that scale.  However the\nwaiter said that their Thai spicy was a 7 and I ended up asking him\nfor a 10 instead.  Since I love spicy food it was not necessarily a\nmistake but I did have tears in my eyes during most of the meal.  I\nalso had two other dining companions that could not finish their meals\ndue to the spice level with one of those dishes only being a 5.  So I\nwould have to recommend that you are careful in the spice level that\nyou order here.  Anyways, my crispy duck ended up tasting good, at\nleast what I could taste of it beyond the heat.  It was not at all\ngreasy and had some crunch whenever I bit into it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in\nthe future.  I really enjoyed their food and also noticed some other\ninteresting looking dishes on their menu that I would like to try\nwhenever my mouth wasn't on fire."

The garlic shrimp was unique as you can eat the entire shrimp (shell and all) since they fry the shell and it melts in your mouth when you eat it!\n\nThe only cons I would say was the service was spotty at times as it took 10-15mins to even get waiter to order.  But once we did get the waiter, we had pretty good service afterwards.\n\nThe portions are smaller than average but then again what they make up for portions, they gain in flavor and quality.\n\nI would suggest ordering 2 dishes & appetizer or 3 dishes for a party of two.\n\nIt is a little more pricier than the average thai place but well worth it!"

The drunken noodle was a bunch of clumped-together wide noodles, so I should have ordered the soft shell crab salad (cabbage, lime dressing, peanuts) instead - I am a big fan of the Vietnamese soft shell crab salad with watercress (cua lot chien bo, a fave of mine at Vietopia in Houston).\n\nThis time we also tried the Tom Kha Kai, and it wasn't as memorable, just a limey coconut-y soup, which I now can make equally as good if not better...the Thai tea was great, the SERVICE was outstanding during the meal except we never got the spicy condiments we asked for and then all waitstaff disappeared and we had to ask the owner or manager for the check.\n\nThe renovation and expansion is certainly an inviting factor - the atmosphere is nice.  Also, Mayor Goodman was dining there, and he turned on his way out the door and waved to our section, and we all waved and cooed, \"Bye Mayor!\"\n\nOverall, prices can be reasonable, but this still hasn't tickled my fancy.

The tom yum soup was tasty and had generous portions of prawns but it came out luke-warm. The northern larb wasn't tangy enough for me, but that was probably our fault for ordering the northern version instead of the usual one. The drunken noodles weren't very empressive, the noodles felt chunky and were clumped together so much so that I basically just speared a chunk with my fork and bit it piece by piece. The papaya salad was good and comparable to some of the good thai restaurants I've been to in NorCal. My favorite dish was probably the curry (can't remember exactly which one we ordered, sorry), it was creamy and oh so flavorful. The prices are in line with most all thai restaurants, but the portions are a little on the smaller end. If you're in Vegas and you really need some Thai food, Lotus of Siam will do the trick but if you've got a taste for solid Thai food this place won't blow your mind."

This is probably the most spacious Thai restaurant I've ever been to - in addition to accommodating multiple large party banquets at the time of our dinner, the restaurant was also serving patrons seated at the full bar (a traditional Thai restaurant with a full bar - classic Vegas; complete anomaly). \n\nDespite the strong fight put up by the drunken noodles and the tom yum noodle soup, I ultimately went for the pork larb ($8.95) with a side of sticky rice ($2) per my waiter's recommendation on the basis of both popularity and healthiness. According to him, the larb - consisting of \"lean\" ground pork mixed with red and green onions and cilantro bathed in a spicy/fishy chili lime dressing, accompanied by a few cucumber slices and a petite wedge of raw cabbage - is prepared with no fat and is one of the most popular menu items. While the dish was undeniably tasty, I found it to be wildly underwhelming on the whole - the flavors tasted exactly identical to the seasoning packets used in Mama brand ramen (which I love but don't need to pay restaurant prices for). The biggest disappointment of all was the dismally poor quality of the pork. Contrary to my waiter's word, the meat was EXTREMELY fatty, and I found myself picking out the visible chunks of fat as I ate. I definitely should've gone for the shrimp instead, but we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for a new dish to come out. The sticky rice was a more moderate disappointment - the rice used is a longer grain than what I encountered in Thailand, so it was more fluffy than sticky. Save yourself $1 and just order the regular steamed rice. \n\nEven though I wasn't impressed with what was a solid 2 star meal, I attribute that more to mis-ordering than bad establishment. Service was fantastic, and you can tell the chef takes great pride in the restaurant and cooking/her food in general. I'm not sure along which basis people can claim this is the best Thai food in America, but I'd be interested in returning if I ever get the chance to try the more specialty / creative menu items, such as the drunken noodles and various seafood offerings - I'd just recommend staying away from the pork."

If you are visiting Vegas, invest in the cab ride out to Lotus of Siam because it is worth it! They have many dishes that you would not find at any other Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, since there were only two of us, we were only able to partake of three dishes. One was the thai sausage (they have 2, we got the one in the back part of the menu). It was spiced unlike any other sausage we'd ever had and was very tasty. We ordered pork belly and chinese brocoli (gai lan) in oyster sauce. It was a simple dish made with very fresh ingredients. The last dish we tried was drunken noodle soft shelled crab. This dish was just very tasty. I had been concerned that the medium spicy sauce we had specified would overwhelm the crab, but it just complimented the crab perfectly. The service was terrific, relaxed, informative, and attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. It was full, but it did not feel rushed. I take off one star because of the decor.

I'm a huge fan of Thai (like Somtum Der, Pam Real Thai and others in NYC) and decided to try it.\n\nThat first dinner was so good that next night, searching for healthier restaurants not far from the Strip, I decided it was easier to just go to Lotus of Siam again.\n\nOver 4 visits (3x for dinner and once for lunch), I tried:\n\nENTREES\n- Northern Larb. Think minced pork with chilis that explodes with flavor, whether you choose a spiciness level closer to 1 or 10. This was the only dish I ordered twice in my 4 visits. Be warned though, if you're not much for hot/spicy, choose a lower number.\n- Nam Prik Ong (Red chili dip). While I saw this dish mentioned in reviews, I wasn't too impressed. It's tasty, just not as much so as the Northern Larb.\n- Khao Soi. This was like a large bowl of flat egg noodles mixed with curry. Tasty but I preferred other dishes mixed with rice.\n- Kang Hung Lay (beef stew). Paired with rice, this dish was good. Fairly flavorful.\n- Isan sausages. This is Thai sausage sliced and served with a bunch of raw veggies (onions, Thai chili peppers, cabbage, etc). A good appetizer to share with friends (Though being hungry, I ordered this along with an entree for myself).\n- Pad kraprow with pork belly and minced chicken. This is usually my go-to dish at Thai restaurants (generally preferring rice to noodles) but in this case I waited a few visits to try this. If you like minced meat with basil and chilis, you'll probably like this. \n\nDRINK\n- A variety of different German Reislings. I haven't traditionally been into wine but admit I'm now sold on pairing them with Thai food.\n- Also Thai iced tea once to see what it was like. Par for the course, not mind-blowingly different.\n\nSUMMARY\nI liked this Thai restaurant so much I ate there 4 times over a 4-day visit.

Crispy Duck with Panang  (5/5): I would actually rate this a 6 on a 5-point scale. This is my FAVORITE DISH at Lotus. The duck is so crispy with the curry on top of it. This dish is literally to die for.\n\n3. Garlic Prawns (5/5): This is on the Chefs Choice menu - these are deep fried prawns with the shells on them and they are saut\u00e9ed with garlic and pepper. Don't peel the shells! This is one of the most amazing dishes they have! Even though it's $21.95, it's very much worth the price. Get it!\n\n4. Khai Soi Braised Short Rib (5/5): This is also on the Chefs Choice menu - another one of my personal favorites. The braised short rib is so tender; you can cut it easily with a fork. It's served over thai egg noodle in curry sauce, served with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This dish is a little pricey too at $20.95, but worth every penny.\n\n5. Panang Curry with Chicken (4/5): The panang curry is really good here too. We rode it with chicken. It's only $11.95 for this dish, and it's a great traditional Thai dish to get with your meal.\n\n6. Drunken Noodle Seafood (4/5): The drunken noodle seafood is one of their top recommendations. These are pan fried flat rice noodles served with an assortment of different seafood (mussels, calamari rings, shrimp, etc.). It is only $12.95, but I must warn that this is a little bit on the spicy side, i.e. more than we expected.\n\n7. Pineapple Fried Rice (4/5): We ordered this to share with a larger group, and it was surprisingly really good. I normally don't order fried rice when I go to a Thai restaurant because I can make it at home, but this was really good. Only $9.95 too for a good-sized order of fried rice.\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the options I've listed above. Of course, if there are just two of you going, you aren't going to order all 7 of the dishes (unless you are really hungry), but the top recommendations I have are the Crispy Duck Panang, the Garlic Prawns, and the Khai Soi Braised Short Rib. Not a whole lot of veggies in those options, but ehhhh, these are the best ones. Can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can pay a visit to Lotus of Siam again. The restaurant itself is not in the best of neighborhoods, and from the outside, it looks like it could be a really crappy place, but do not be fooled. Go inside and taste the amazing savory dishes that I miss so dearly. Ok seriously, go there NOW!"

It was a Friday night and we were seated right away when we got there ( no wait time, how cool is that?!) but maybe we were lucky. The ambiance isn't all that great but the delicious food makes up for the lack of decor. Anyone that thinks they've tried the best Thai food has to come here. My boyfriend and I shared the fried chicken with garlic appetizer. It came with about 7 pieces and they were all super crunchy and juicy on the inside with just the right amount of flavor from the garlic spices. For our main dish, I ordered the short rib curry noodles for my boyfriend and the pad-see-ew for myself. My favorite was the short rib curry noodles. I thought it would've tasted weird adding curry to noodles but the noodles were flat and light that it went well with the thick soupy sauce. The short rib was just so tender and it fell off my fork because the meat was so soft. I would definitely come here again the next time I come to Vegas. It's not on the strip ( probably about 3 miles off ) but so many people go there that there are taxis going back and forth from the restaurant to the strip. If you're planning on drinking, taking a taxi would be a smart idea."

I tried the Pad Thai, fried rice, fried banana, chicken curry (Good but a little spicey) and egg rolls.\n\nOverall, like I said the food was good but not the best I ever had.

We were told the wait was 1 hour and we were willing to wait. \n\nAs my two friends and I were waiting, one of them got so hungry from the thought that he was not able to eat within the hour he went to the next door Indian restaurant to eat a small meal lol. \n\nThe GOODS:\nThe wait was NOT an hour, it was around 30 minutes. We got the crispy duck and two more dishes which I have forgotten the names but everything was LEGIT TO THE MAX. One of the dishes was some sort of braised beef in a curry sauce. The waiter asked us how spicy do we want our food from the scale of 1-10 and we said 5 and to my taste buds, the chefs made it RIGHT ON. The service was excellent and I can not complain much about this establishment."

            "review": "Tried several things, but the best two dishes we've tried are the garlic prawns and the khao soi. The garlic prawns were consistently good both times. The khao soi was much better during our first visit, with beef, versus the second time, with duck. We also tried the beef drunken noodles, nam kao tod, nam prik ong and beef pad se ew, but none of these were nearly as good as the garlic prawns and khao soi. Since they do take-out, we're tempted to just pick up the garlic prawns from this place and then stopping by to get the Peking duck bao, short rib grilled cheese and sesame noodles from nearby Fat Choy, if we venture to this portion of Las Vegas.\n\nThe garlic prawns are the best thing here. The meat of the prawn is almost entirely removed from the shell so that it is only attached to the shell at the tail. The entire prawn, shell and all, is then deep fried perfectly. The meat remains tender but the shell becomes the best shrimp chip you have ever had. The garlic prawns are great by themselves and seasoned very well, but the garlic sauce that they add on top make the prawns even better. There is an added bit of sweetness in the garlic sauce that is perfect.\n\nThe khao soi is essentially a coconut curry noodle dish. The first time we got it, we chose beef as the meat. We were initially hesitant about squeezing in the accompanying lime, but the waiter was kind enough to recommend that we try it that way. We were right to listen. The added acidity from the lime juice made the sweet, fatty coconut curry even better. The second time, we decided to try the crispy duck khao soi. Alas, the coconut curry was a bit off this time. It didn't have the initial wow that we experienced during the first trip here, even after squeezing in the lime juice. In addition, the amount of curry and noodles was also smaller than the beef khao soi. The duck was cooked well with a crispy skin, but the reason you are here is for the khao soi.\n\nThe other items we tried here were less successful. The drunken noodle (pad kee mao elsewhere) were very pedestrian and nowhere as good as the drunken noodles we have had in Los Angeles. Similarly, the pad se ew was also lackluster. It tasted like pad se ew, but it wasn't the best pad se ew you've ever had. The nam prik ong was also a bit disappointing. In essence, this is a tomato paste served with crudit\u00e9 and fried pork skin. There was nothing about the sauce that made it memorable, being just a tomato paste. The nam kao tod is crispy rice mixed with sausage, cilantro, lime juice, peanut and chilis. From the description, again, I would have expected something very bright and complex, but it was again fairly plain.\n\nWe would come back or just do take out for the garlic prawns and maybe the khao soi (but not the crispy duck version of it). Better yet, we would probably just pick up the garlic prawns here and then head over somewhere else to complete the meal."

A ways off the north end of the strip in a shopping mall plaza that you wouldn't stumble across even after the most crazy night in Vegas if you weren't looking for it.  \nNow that we have that over with, when you walk in you realize why this place has garnered its reputation.\nThe food is simply phenomenal. I mean, I've been to Thailand, gone to a Thai cooking class, and eaten every kind of street food there and Lotus of Siam was essentially the same thing minus the plane flight. The dishes were incredible, from the traditional Northern Thai (pork-based) dishes they are known for, to the duck, to the pineapple rice and stuffed chicken wings.\n\nWithout question order food family-style, don't eat the whole day before you go, and stuff your face when you are there.\n\nWe felt so amazed by the experience, that we demanded to personally thank the chef, which we were able to do (and of course snapped a photo of the occasion).\n\nA must for anyone looking for some of the most authentic thai food in the US."

I am a big time foodie & I have been this glutenous a couple times in my life.\n\nIf there's a wait, wait. It will be worth it. The finest food with superior service, wait. Sonny was my waiter. Very good service. For a second, he tried to let me know I was ordering a lot. I told him I had eaten 2 entrees a prior visit. Not another word, just smiled & whipped it out. Perfect timing, water glass kept filled, checked in at exactly the right time, Sonny does it right...\n\nYes, a tad pricey but worth every penny & more.

The only dish I probably wouldn't order again is the Nua yum katiem. It was the only dish that I felt like there wasnt a party in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, it was still very yummy. I wouldn't order it again only because they have such an extensive menu and I'd like to try new dishes.\n\nService- attentive and helpful. I had a very bad experience at a Thai restaurant due to their spice level. If you're from LA, you've probably heard of Jitlada. I ordered a dish and they never asked for the spice level or neither bothered to explain how spicy the dish was. It was to the point my head started hurting and I couldn't eat anything afterward. Well unlike Jitlada, this restaurant explain the spicy level and what was appropriate for each dish.\n\nFYI- wait is always long. It's about an hour wait."

Although, I don't quite have a favorite dish there is a particular dish that everyone should order if it's your first time visiting Lotus of Siam, and that dish is the prawns!  They are so delightful and the best part about the prawns is that they are so deliciously deep fried you can eat the head and shells!  Sounds weird but trust me on this one, its definitely a good appetizer for a party of 2-4 people.  \n\nThe service here is absolutely great, on one particular visit a friend from out of town was returning home that same day.  We had about 10 minutes to go before Lotus would close at their lunch closing at 2:30pm, so we placed a phone order and pretty much told them to prepare a lunch for 3 and they could choose all the entrees, just to make sure they included the prawns of course!  They served us a well balance lunch and most of all upon arrive to pick up the food to go like we originally phoned in, they took the the time to dish everything up and allowed us to enjoy the meal in the restaurant.

We booked two shows and went looking on the internet to find something \"different\". When we came upon the Lip Smacking Foodie Tour we knew that it was for us. My wife and I both like to cook and we have visited most of the upper-tier restaurants in and around Chicago. We signed up for the evening strip tour with drinks. We hesitated when we saw the price but we said, what the heck, it seems overpriced but let's do it anyway.\n\nWe met our guides Abra and Donald, and the four other tour participants in front of the Aria at 6PM. For the next four hours we were treated to gracious hosts, reserved seating, luscious food and delicious drinks. An easy cop-out for the tour would to be to go the well known chef driven restaurants, the Guy Fieri's, the Wolfgang Puck's, etc... What we did instead was to go to the lesser know chef driven restaurants where the food is really delivered with commitment and passion. At each stop we were given three, and sometimes four, of the chefs signature dishes. I could not tell you which stop was my favorite as they were all great. We were always very heartily welcomed at the restaurants. The staff, and sometimes the chef him/her self, would come out to explain the dishes and to thank us for coming. Be ready for somewhat adventurous eating. If meatloaf and mashed potatoes is your idea of a great meal out then this is probably not for you. And the drinks, they were always plentiful and delicious. They were also sure to complimented the food being served. Surprisingly, one was very elaborate, involving fire and alcohol vapor sipped from a beaker. Not only did the tour provide us with great food and drink, along the route we were treated to a behind the scenes tour and tasting of how chocolate was made and a very interesting stop at a unique shop that we had walked by several time without really noticing. Very cool! Don and Abra also pointed out several art installations that we had missed before. Nothing like a little culture with your movable feast.\n\nThe following day, when we showed the concierge at our hotel the prior evening's itinerary she was very impressed. She said that these were some of here favorite restaurants and that they were definitely \"under the radar\" for most tourists.  She said that she plans now to take the tour herself.\n\nSo, all in all it was a great experience. The food and drink was fantastic. The hosts did a great job and the walking part of the tour was interesting and enlightening. As far as the cost of the tour in concerned, we now feel that it is a drop dead bargain. If the experience sounds good to you, do not let the price deter you. I think that you will find that it is well worth the price of admission."

It looks kind of ghetto from the outside, but the inside was nice. We ordered chicken pad thai, beef pad see ew, chicken panang curry, papaya salad and chicken satay. Everything was pretty good, but the portions were kind of small for the price (probably because I'm used to SoCal portions). At medium spicy, the papaya salad was pretty freaking spicy so I would recommend mild. \n\nAlso when we were leaving we saw Zedd and his crew coming in so that was a fun plus!

I've had much better in Seattle, California and Ithaca (believe it or not). \n\nI asked for recommendations, and the waiter recommended drunken noodles, and duck panang curry. I was a little disappointed because the dishes sounded ordinary, and I felt like he may have assumed we were not adventurous by our appearances. I may go back and order dishes off the northern menu, or make it clear I'm adventurous. \n\nAnyway, off of recommendations online and from the waiter we got the garlic prawns, crispy rice, and duck with masaman curry. \n\nThe crispy rice really didn't appeal to me. It tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and even had large strips of ginger in it. A little ginger goes a long way! It also had too much lemon grass. Eating it made my mouth fatigued and overwhelmed and not in a pleasant way at all. The sausage was really not good. The flavors just weren't balanced and the texture of the rice was good but not great. The pig skins in there were very good - I wish there had been more. \n\nThe garlic prawns were really not good either. the shrimp meat was overcooked, but my main complaint was the flavor. The fried shrimp shells were very interesting and the texture was pleasing, but there was just no flavor in the dish at all besides black pepper and an oily fried food taste. Some kind of dipping sauce would have been ideal, but proper seasoning might have been enough to make it good. I kept dipping it in the red curry that came with but I would've preferred something acidic or sweet. Really ANYTHING to balance out the oily taste. It was served over slaw, but that was not dressed either - it was just there to catch the excess oil. \n\nThe duck dish was very good. The duck was excellent, but I don't think it paired that well with masaman curry. I would order this again with a different sauce. It was silly of me to order the curry because, c'mon, you can get that kind of curry anwhere! But the curry tasted good. It didn't blow my mind, and I would've preferred if it wasn't broken. Overall, very disappointing. It wasn't worth the stomach ache of three deep fried dished, that's for sure! \n\nAlso, yes it's easy to get a taxi there but how do you get back?? I had to wait an hour for a taxi to come get us after the meal and they had no idea where it was and couldn't find the restaurant."

The one bad part about this was that there were only two of us, meaning we couldn't order a lot (well, we could have, but then we'd have a buttload leftover). So we settled on a cup of the Tom Yum Koong, Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles, and the Fried Garlic Prawns.\n \nNeedless to say, we really enjoyed all three. The soup had just the right amount of tanginess and kick, and the cup was full of huge shrimp (oxymoron, I know).\n \nMy wife had never eaten soft shell crab before, so she was a little weirded out by it here, but I really liked it and we both loved the noodles; great texture and flavor there.\n \nAnd I liked the prawns more and more as I ate them, but I have to say... I'm not sure how I feel about eating the shells like chips. There's definitely a certain taste to it, but I don't think I'm a fan of it just yet. I'll have to try it again.\n \nWe got there fifteen minutes prior to opening on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately. The restaurant is spacious and clean, so try to get there as close to opening time as possible. Otherwise, I would recommend making reservations.\n \nHaving said all that, I'm not sure that I can back the statement of this being the best Thai restaurant in the country, but it is dang good. Take that however you'd like. And I will be back, but hopefully with more people so I can try more dishes. So many to choose from!"

I have travelled the world and eaten cuisine from many different countries, and It is hard for me to even fathom how this place can have an avg of 2 hours wait for dinner. \n\nI ordered the following:\n\n1. Garlic prawns: 0/5. I ordered based on the rave reviews. At $28, I expected more than prawn shells that were fried to oblivion. Half the shells didn't even have any meat inside. It was severely lacking in garlic flavor.\n\n2. Tom yum Kai: 3/5 tasty but lukewarm. I expected it to be steaming hot, but it felt like the bowl had been sitting out for a while before it was served.\n\n3. Crispy pork belly (#87): 0/5 can be a true delicacy if done right. Lotus, however, did not get it right. It was cold and the portion was abysmal for the price. I could have taken a slab of bacon and fried it with better flavor\n\n4. Drunken noodles with seafood: 0/5 again, portion was small for the price. To add insult to injury, they used fake imitation crab!!! That's disgusting. \n\nOverall, not worth the wait or the $80 bill. I have heard that the famous lady chef who made this restaurant into fame has retired, and I believe it because based on my experience, it is no better than the average Thai restaurant in middle of nowhere Wyoming.

I even went to Thailand specifically to take cooking classes and had a wonderful time.\n\nI went to Vegas for my birthday weekend and one of my best friends raved about Lotus of Siam and encouraged me to go. So I went first thing I arrived and had my first dinner there. We ordered the stuff everyone raved about for our first dinner -- and I was beyond unimpressed. In fact, I didn't like a single one of the dishes. One of the dishes everyone said was a \"must order\" (Nam Kao Tod, aka crispy rice with sausage) I thought was awful. It was too salty, the rice was not crispy at all, and there was no actual flavor to distinguish that made it taste good.\n\nThe other \"must order\" (and is the cover photo on their home page) is the Garlic Prawns. They didn't suck but anything fried is pretty good as long as it's fresh. Unfortunately, they were dimensionless in flavor and had very little prawn meat (it was mostly fried shell and was overpriced).\n\nAnd lastly, because they're known for their Northern Thai dishes (which is hard to find in the US) and because I love jackfruit, we ordered the Kang Ka Joon (spicy young jack fruit curry) -- what I thought would be a curry turned out to be a tangy clear broth soup and the jackfruit was \"off\"in texture and the flavor was just ... flat.\n\nWe were beyond disappointed and the wait staff never came back to check in on us after delivering our food. We didn't want to throw the towel on the first go, so we went back on our last day to have our last meal (lunch) there. When we went back for our last lunch we decided to just stick with some classics: Pad See Ew, Green Curry Chicken, and Green Papaya Salad. We asked for the salad to be mild but it came out so flaming hot that they had to remake it for us. We asked for a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, and they brought us a 10. The other two dishes were just fine. A solid B, but not something I would consider as \"the best Thai in North America.\" I love Jonathan Gold (the food writer for the LA Times) to pieces and his reviews are usually spot on, but I have to say that I would never go out of the way to go back to Lotus of Siam because I have had such good Thai all over the country (especially in Southern California and in New York City).\n\nAnd I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to go there, either. But if you're in Vegas and you have your own car and you're hankering for Thai food, this might be your best/only option. Otherwise, it's not worth the hype or the wait. Just go if there's no line or wait. Fortunately, we only waited 15 minutes for our dinner and for lunch we just walked in.\n\nI really wanted it to work out but honestly, it was just kind of meh. It's really too bad."

Definitely the best in LV that I've had, and I used to live here for part of my life.  I'm sure some people have had a bad experience for various reasons, but here's my take...\n\nGood news:  Phad see ew, drunken noodles, and curry's are some of my favorite dishes.  Phad Thai is also good here (and I'm not even a big fan of that- we had fried tofu in ours- delicious!)  If you can handle the heat try the green papaya salad (som tom)-  It's a small serving but your mouth with be crying tears of joy and pain from all of the fire.  I wanted to try the beef salad but haven't had a chance yet.  I also love Thai deserts so Khao Neeo (sticky rice) with coconut and mangoes was good here (mangoes weren't super sweet, but weren't in season so not necessarily their fault).  \n\nBad news:  the area is sketchy, and there is really no way to make reservations (the email thing is useless), so show up before it opens if you have a large party to put your name on the list or be prepared to wait.  The portions are smaller, but everybody at our party was stuffed (party of 7) for only about $130 (no alcohol).  That's  deal for good food in my mind for Vegas.

You can get that anywhere.\n\nOh, reservations are recommended but if it's a weeknight and early, head over and get on the list. They have a wine bar in the back that where you can wait. Wine selection is quite nice too! Lots of German varieties."

Pad thai (yes, someone ordered it), was the usual. Basil chicken was forgettable.\nGreen chile dip was fine. The famous garlic prawns had maybe 2 pieces with actual meat, the rest was batter and/or shells. Thai Teas were standard. We got dessert elsewhere, as they were out of the mango and nothing else sounded appealing.\n\nTIP: Call in your reservation, as there was availability despite their site seeming booked for weeks. In fact, we really didn't need our reservation for 5 (which we were shocked they so easily let us change from 4 at the last minute, until we arrived: Somehow the place was absolutely dead at 8:30pm on a Friday)...sure, I know it's Vegas and not everyone just eats the whole trip, but don't people hit the strip at all hours, and isn't this place supposed to always be mobbed?\n\n*At a Northern Thai spot I realize this is a bad move, but I've had good Northern Thai meals with the same mild seasoning."

Too many choices. \"Quality over quantity,\" as it's said. I would have appreciated the server spending more time recommending traditional Northern Thai dishes, but perhaps I'll have to go when they can spare the attention. \n\nWe ordered quite a few dishes, but not one came out at a temperature that didn't lead you to believe it was sitting in front of a fan on a hot summer day.\n\nSpicy Chicken Wings\nIssan-style Beef Jerky\nTom Yum Kai\nSeared Scallops with Chili Basil Leaves\nDrunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab\nGarlic Prawns\nBraised Short Rib with Panang\nCrispy Duck with Panang\n\nI don't like to request my dishes be brought back for any reason, but I find the taste of cold fried food incredibly off-putting. The prawns were the only dish I asked of. It would have felt exhausting to request every dish be reheated. And then there's the question of \"how?\" How are you warming my dish? In a microwave, or are you sparing a few precious minutes in a wok?\n\nBusiness is good for Lotus of Siam thanks to the celebrity visits. Maybe with some extra funds they'll invest in better warming lamps for their dishes, or teach their chefs/runners how to better coordinate the timing sending food out. There's so much potential; I know it and I want to believe it. For this reason I'll go back and try again.\n\n(In a perfect world of temperature-hot foods, I would definitely order the drunken noodles and garlic prawns again; everything else was uninspiring)"

A trip to Las Vegas isn't complete without coming here for dinner. Make sure and research the menu prior to coming as there's literally over 100 entrees to pick you 2-3 choices.  Getting recommendations from your server is good advice.  You can't go wrong as the food quality is top notch and expect some of the best Thai you've ever had.  It's a $20 taxi ride from LV strip and make sure and get reservations.  Be aware they only hold your reservation for 5 minutes, so get here early if on Fri-Sun night."

But inside is a nice casual ambience with two sides of a dining room. \n\nI definitely think this place is overhyped, although It is better than other Thai places in Vegas. We ordered a grip load of food between the 4 of us. \n\nRaw shrimp- 5/5. Best raw shrimp compared to my area in Orange County . The chili sauce and house made satay chili oil together was a mouth orgasm. Yum. \n\nSeafood Tom Yum- 3.5/5 I think I like my soup more with a spicier and tangy kick to it. This soup was just okay to me. \n\nGarlic Prawn Shrimp- 3.5/5 it's good, don't get me wrong. It's got a good taste and nice crisp to it. But it's nothing mind blowing because I've had something similar to it before. \n\nSpicy Spaghetti- 3.0/5 not what I imagined .. I thought it was going to have tomato/marinara sauce but it was some spicy chili sauce. \n\nKao Soi- 4.5-5 crispy duck curry with egg noodle was great. The curry was too much coconut for my taste but that's only because I'm sensitive to coconut, otherwise this is a great noodle dish! \n\nBeef jerky- 4.5/5 such a random pick my friend ordered but it's a solid appetizer just to pick at. It's surprisingly good and addicting!\n\nWe had other items but not worth mentioning. Overall... I probably wouldn't make a visit if I was in Vegas again."

So, was it any good?\n\nMy wife and I came here for a early dinner. Needless to say, I was not so surprised to see the place packed full of customers at 6 pm on a Wednesday. They even have a celebrity wall of fame. We ordered the following:\n\nNam Prik Ong (red chili dip) $10.95\n\nIsaan Sausage $9.95\n\nGarlic prawns $21.95\n\nTom Yum Koong (Bowl) $10.95\n\nCrab Fried Rice $13.95\n\nThe food was very good. I would say the best dish was the crab fried rice. It had a good balance with the egg, tomato, and onions. The dip was okay. It tasted like spicy bolognese (did i spell that right?) sauce thai style that you can dip fresh veges and chicharron pieces into. FYI, the spicy level was a 3 1/2 out of 5 for my taste and the menu stated it was the least spiciest of the dips! The Isaan sausage tasted good. Think sour longanisa but in a good way. I did though take out some of unrendered fat bits out. The Garlic prawns were pretty tasty. You could eat the shells which was plus. It was a little on the greasy side so the extra napkins surely helped. The soup was good but not something I would order again. Overall I would say that Lotus of Siam was a good experience. The staff are very attentive and friendly. They even pack your leftovers for you and answer any questions about the menu in a short yet concise way. I'll come again to try the crispy duck and the crab fried rice again...and a beer!"

We ordered the Issan sausage, crispy duck w/mint, nam kao tod, and the tom kah kai. I felt like a lot of the food was overly salty, but maybe its just my taste pallet. Everything was okay, not super amazing."

Once you walked in the restaurant, it was packed.  Even at 2pm all the tables were full.  They seem to have an extensive wine list with may good wines.  We ordered a few dishes, I feel they were all good.  The egg rolls were nice a crunchy, but a bit bland.  The spicy fried rice & noodles we ordered were good. The Thai ice tea was awesome ( I had to get a second one for the road).  Since I live in the bay area and we have soooo many great Thai restaurants, I felt this place was just good, not great like I was expecting from the reviews."

There was a 30 or 45 minute wait, of which we spent at the bar. Though I was disappointed there were no cocktails, and not impressed by the shrimp roll appetizer we ordered, the actual meal made up for it. We went with what most people ordered off Yelp - the garlic shrimp and crispy duck in panang curry. So good! That deep fried shrimp skin - on point! So funny it was described as a potato chip, because it's very true! I usually eat the skin of deep fried shrimp anyway (what can I say...I'm lazy), but my wife doesn't usually. This shrimp skin goodness, she loved. I even caught her scraping the panang curry with one of those shrimp skin chips! We've visited Thailand and always complain that the food in the states doesn't compare. We thoroughly enjoyed this meal and plan to go back very soon.

I guess I went to Lotus of Siam expecting something magnificent, to only be disappointed by a dinner of mediocrity. \n\nHaving heard about Lotus of Siam and read the numerous glowing reviews on the internet, I had thought that we were going to be experiencing an orgasmic meal of mammoth proportions. Some of the reviews had proclaimed that Lotus of Siam was the best Thai restaurant on the West Coast. But I beg to differ. \n\nThe food was mildly good. The restaurant itself was very bland, shoved away in a bleak strip mall in the dark corners of Las Vegas. Walking up to the restaurant, we had high expectations, but those were soured when we entered. The walls were overflowing with numerous accolades and yellowing newspaper clippings declaring the success and importance of the restaurant. OK so that was a good sign. Contrary to the restaurant's proclamation that there were no open seats, the supposed \"packed\" restaurant was dotted with a few parties and looked quite spare.\n\nSo we sat down in a booth towards the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen and ordered a few bottles of sake. After being provided with our small bottles of sake and menus, we began ordering. A lady came by our table, the owner I guess, and tried to push a fried fish on us stating that we would like it. In fact, most of the night the servers tried telling us what we would like and not like suspecting us to be \"virgin\" Thai food eaters. \n\nThe food came out in a somewhat fast progression, coupled with more bottles of sake. By that time we were feeling a wee bit of the sake, but the food kept us in reality as it did not conjure orgasmic feelings. In fact the food itself was quite unsettling, with very little flavor. By that time the owner had tried pushing the fried fish on us four times, we still did not budge. \n\nLeaving Lotus of Siam, we realized how spoiled we had become. Thai Nakorn was still the champion and Lotus proved to be an unworthy opponent."

It is always packed especially on Fridays-Sundays, less waiting time to go during a weekday night! The outside looks very sketchy & the inside looks outdated, its decor consists of over 100 framed photos of famous people who ate there with a large display room of wine bottles.

With that being said, on to my thoughts on Lotus of Siam. \n \nWe started of with an appetizer of Shrimp wrapped with bacon wrapped in a won-ton wrap. This one has a nice bacon flavor, which doesn't always happen with bacon appetizers. I imagine if you ordered this to go the wrapper would suck but seeing as we ate it at the restaurant it was quite good as the wrapper was nice and crisp. It came with a light sweet and sour sauce which complemented it well. All in all a worthwhile appetizer. 4.5 out of 5\n\nWe ordered Yellow curry with pork (#4 on the spicy level). It was good but not great, like I said earlier I like my curry sauce a little bit thick and I like it to have a little more sweetness than this one had. Would I order it again? Probably, but that has more to do with really liking curry than really liking this dish. 3 out of 5\n\nWe also ordered the Crab fried rice. How do you describe good fried rice. I don't know but this is it. Slightly sweet, just the right amount of oil, this was an excellent dish. 5 out 5\n\nService - The service was ok, a little long waiting for someone to come with our check but U expect things like this with a busy restaurant that has reasonable prices. 3.5 out 5\n\nWould we go back? Maybe, since we don't live in Vegas my guess is we would probably try something different next time since that is half the fun but you never know."

The second thing is the service. I have been here more than a dozen times, and I love the mango and sticky rice they serve - it's amazing, do try it if you can!

Turns out they only serve it to certain guests. Last month when I went, I asked for this dessert - the waiter said immediately that it is \"out of season\" thus they dont have it anymore. However, our own waiter told us other wise, and brought it out for us. As we were leaving, we heard another guest asking for the same dessert and were told too that it was \"out of season.

We had reservations for dinner and were seated promptly.   We love Southeast Asian food and have been to lots of Thai, Laotian, Burmese restaurants in California and Asia.  There were about 100 other diners in the restaurant when we arrived. There were many things that ended up being unique about this restaurant, unfortunately the quality of the food was not one of them. First, about 99% of clientele was Caucasian. This is never a good sign at an Asian restaurant. Everyone had a bottle of wine at their table. That's another oddity at an Asian restaurant.  Despite these two warning signs, we still felt we would be in for a great experience, based on yelp reviews.  We really weren't looking for ambiance, wine or decor. We were looking for \"the best Thai food in the US, as promised in these reviews.  We ordered the Northern Thai soup, which was ok but not balanced and way too heavy on fish sauce.  We had Nam Prik Onn, chili dip, which is a peasant dish popular in Northern Thailand and Burma. It usually  contains a bit of meat or fish in a very salty sauce into which vegetables are dipped.  It's eaten because meat and protein are rare and expensive in parts of thailand and Burma.  It gives a bit of taste to cheap veggie meals.  Here it was 10 bucks for a few tablespoons of something that tasted like middle america spaghetti sauce, a few vegetables to dip, and a handful of packaged chicharones (pork rinds) straight from the chips section of the local supermarket. We had Laotian style papaya salad, which was good. We also had crispy duck in chili mint sauce, deep fried fish in chili sauce, northern thai sausage.   We also had a combination dessert with coconut ice cream, sticky rice, mango, and banana wrapped in wonton wraps and deep fried.  Overall food was acceptable. Nothing was great. We had to add another dish at the end because we were still hungry at the end, portions were so small. No drinks except water. Bill came to $120 for 3 people. Add the $35 round trip cab fare from strip.  Absolutely ridiculous for mediocre Thai food. We went to a fantastic Laos / Northeastern Thai restaurant in East Oakland California a month ago and had almost the same things, with much better quality and larger portions for $39!  Of course there wasn't the huge wine selection, but who goes to a Thai restaurant for wine. That would be like going to a French restaurant for rice.\nBig disappointment and way over-priced."

Who knew that prawns could be sooo tasty that you wouldn't think twice about eating the shell?\n\nThe menu is quite extensive, so we were only able to sample several dishes here. We tried the red chili dip (Ming Tsai's recommendation), chicken satay, the chicken soup with a coconut base and hints of lemongrass (amazing!), seafood salad, braised short ribs (panang). All were tastefully done and lived up to the spice level scale. Since they didnt have the mango sticky rice (our server said they only have this during the summer), I settled for an order of fried bananas with coconut ice cream; it did not disappoint.\n\nI was highly impressed with the service that we received once we were seated,\ngiven that it was a typical busy Friday night. Our drinks were refilled constantly and both of our servers seemed to be on the same page. We were always greeted with smiles from our two servers and they seemed genuinely happy to know that we really enjoyed our first meal at Lotus of Siam.\n\nMy biggest lesson learned from this visit was reservations, reservations, reservations!! It was obvious that the word is out about the fantastic food here at Lotus of Siam, so make reservations as early as you can to avoid being put on the waitlist. Unfortunately, I tried making reservations for a Friday night on that same day and they were all booked.\nOur party of three had to wait between 45-60 minutes, which seemed like a long time given that we were starving and frustrated to see people walk in and get seated once they entered.\n\nLotus of Siam is hands down one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to. The decor is simple and doesn't look like your typical Thai restaurants. This isn't a bad thing, as the place is still classy with a plethora of wine bottles on display and a noteworthy clean bathroom (which sadly isn't typical at a handful of Asian restaurants). I will definitely be back, even just for the garlic prawns, and plan to try some new dishes! Nom nom nom!"

And it's in an old, creepy shopping center, but it's worth going to. All of the awards that you see when you walk into the restaurant are well deserved. This place kills it with their Thai food! And it's cheap....especially compared to what you'll pay eating on the strip!\n\nThe only thing I regret about our visit was ordering the Nam Prik Noom (Green Chile Dip) as an appetizer. My husband is obsessed with green chile which is why we ordered it. But we both didn't like it. I honestly am not sure why it is on the menu. The dish is cold. It was pretty much roasted green chilies, chopped up with onion, garlic and tomato. We ordered it spicy so I think they threw some thai chilies in there as well. And it was served with cut up vegetables and fried pork skin for dipping. It didn't taste good. I don't see how this dish is appetizing. I could have made this for myself at home. But why would anybody eat a slice of carrot or cucumber and dip it in green chili at a Thai restaurant? Just seemed random to me. I don't recommend ordering this.\n\nHowever, for lunch my husband got the Crispy Duck on Drunken Noodle which was incredible!!! Best drunken noodle dish I've ever had. The portion size was big so I ended up eating half of his. The duck was crispy and served on top of pan fried flat rice noodles. The thai basil in the dish really made it flavorful! SO GOOD! Highly recommended!\n\nI ordered the Kao Soi which is egg noodles in a red curry base and a touch of coconut cream. I chose beef for my meat choice and WOW this dish was so hearty, spicy, and flavorful! It tasted like thai comfort food. If you love curry and coconut this is the perfect dish. It was a nice change compared to the curry & rice that I usually eat since this dish comes with noodles. I would order this dish again in a heartbeat!\n\nOverall, AMAZING spot and definitely worth coming to if you love authentic Thai cuisine! A lot of locals in Vegas recommended this place to us and it is a true gem."

Every minute!\n\nWe started off with the En Tuan soup.  En Tuan means slow cooked.  You have to like tendon to be able to enjoy this one.  Generous slices of slow cooked beef and tendon in a flavorful basil, hot and sour broth.  Oh so good!  Luckily, I checked other Yelp reviews, so I knew to order medium spicy.  Even at medium, it was really spicy, just the perfect amount for me.  I like it spicy where you have to take a sip of your drink every other bite, but not so spicy where your lips and tongue are on fire!  \n\nI'm not a huge fan of panang curry.  I usually prefer regular yellow curry.  But after reading other Yelper's reviews that this is the best dish, I had to try the Crispy duck on panang.  This dish was alright in my opinion.  The crispy duck skin was delicious but the duck itself was a little on the dry side.  Plus, there was hardly any meat, mostly skin.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Prawns.  My picture posted, doesn't do this dish justice.  Huge prawns with the shell still attached but slighty pulled back and deep fried.  The prawn shells were so light and crispy, I must find out how they do it!  Overall, this dish tastes very similar to Salt & Pepper shrimp at a Chinese restaurant.  \n\nLastly, we had Pad Thai.  Boring, I know.  It was different in the fact that they used thin clear noodles instead of the wide linguine type noodles and it wasn't saucy.  Not much to write about here. \n\nI've come to the conclusion that I have to come back with a bigger group of people and try more on their menu.  There are a lot of dishes towards the back of the menu with Northern Thai cuisine that I've yet to experience."

Went on a Sunday night with a group of 4....so not a super big group or a super busy night, but we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. Always a good sign.\n\nOur waiter was super helpful and always had an immediate opinion when we asked for help deciding between 2 dishes, 2 wines, etc. Highly recommend appetizer #14 (the crunchy rice), any of the fried catfish sides/dishes, and the sea bass with drunken noodles. Best green curry I've ever had, and this is my litmus test at any new Thai restaurant I visit. Spice/heat is totally customized on a scale of 1 to 10. Our group ranged from 6.5 to 9.5.....definitely felt it, but sooooo yummy!\n\n\"Normal\" prices and generous servings....we were all heartbroken we didn't have a fridge for our leftovers and couldn't take them with us.

After seeing several articles, an Anthony Bourdain episodes, and a James Beard elect (2011) award- I could not wait to try it. \n\nSo I was lucky enough to go twice here over the course of the weekend. I went Saturday (5:30PM- opening time) & Sunday 6PM, both without reservations. At opening, you may see a massive line, but it moves fast and you get a seat almost right away. If you wait a half hour, the wait bumps up to 1 hour. So either get a reservation or go right when it opens. \n\nAfter coming here twice, I have to give Lotus of Siam all around compliments:\n\n1) The staff-  they are very friendly and amazingly fast.   If you are in a rush , you can go from seating to check in 30 min. But at the same time, if you are enjoying yourself and chatting, they do not rush you. \n\n2) The management's ethics- While I was waiting for a table on Sunday, about six 60+ year old customers (not sure which European country they hailed from) came in and seemed highly annoyed about an hour wait. Those of us patiently waiting (which included grandparents and children) watched as one man in the group pulled out a wad of cash,and tucked $40-60 dollars in his palm to bribe the staff for a table. This guy continued to haggle with the staff for about 10 minutes. But the staff continued to decline his bribe and did not let him skip ahead of anyone. They gained a huge amount of respect from me and the the other dinner's who saw these events play out.\n\n3) The food- Delicious and extremely well priced. Now I enjoy a really spicy meal and want to roll my eyes when people ask me \"are you SURE you want spicy...it's really spicy!\"  I usually like it as hot as it comes. But something made me feel like the food was going to be authentic here so I went \"medium spice.\" For me this was perfect, enough to tingle the lips and make the nose run a little, but not too much to make me chug a glass of milk. If you cannot handle spice, go well below medium.\n\nAppetizers I tried: \n-Golden Fried Tofu (like any other place, good but nothing unique)\n-Nam Kao Tod (Small dish but packed with spice and flavor, really loved this)\n\nDishes I tried: \n-Chili & Basil Seafood combo (delicious with rich basil flavor, good kick to it too)\n- Pad Se Ew (basic dish but well made)\n-Thum Ka Noon (Rich, spicy dish with jackfuit but not heavy at all, one of my favorites)\n- Kang Hung Lay (sweet and spicy pork curry, heavier dish but packed with flavor)\n\nDessert: \n-Mango and sticky Rice (basic dish but really fresh mango and rice was not dried, delicious!)\n\n\nThis place was great and will be a must on future Vegas trips!"

We were the first to arrive for lunch on a Thursday, and the restaurant filled up within minutes. Delicious and fresh with reasonable portion sizes, highly recommend the garlic prawns as a special decadent treat as well as the pad see ew. Very well priced compared to restaurants on the strip.

We got a number of the normal Thai dishes - panang curry, pad see ewe, pad thai, etc. They were all great with one odd exception. No one in the group was a fan of the pad thai. There was something different about it, the color was much darker almost as if they had added some sort of tomato paste (guessing). But everything else was fantastic.\n\nThe highlight for me was the thai dishes I had never seen before. There was a short rib in some very spicy orange sauce (forget the name exactly) which was absolutely superb and I will get it EVERY time I return. It is simply fantastic. We also had a unique seabass dish which was good on its own, but great with some other spicy sauce that was served with the dish. \n\nI would highly, highly recommed Lotus of Siam as the best off-the-strip restaurant I've been to in Vegas."

Hangovers you see. So, some Tom Kha Kai was not an option but a necessity. We asked the conceirge at our hotel where some good Thai places were and once he found out we had a car he told us to go here and I am now going to call The Rio to tell them that guys needs a raise! The guy said it was perhaps \"the best Thai food in the country\" and I sort of chuckled to myself because I KNOW the best Thai is in Norwalk at Renu Nekorn. What did he know? Ha!\n\nWhen we got there I was ready to start talking sh#t because it was in some funky strip mall in BFE. But then I thought to myself, all the great local spots are in funky strip malls. So I wedged my way through the horde of people in the waiting area and saw the walls plastered with reviews from just about every news source you can think of. Thought it was a decent sign so I made our reservation and decided to wait the 25 minutes for a table.\n\nAs I stood by the wall my friend says to me, \"hey didn't you guys live in Norwalk? This says the chef is from Norwalk.\" To my pleasant surprise the chef is the SAME EXACT chef from Renu Nekorn! How's that for a kick in the pants! Apparently he had enough of So Cal and moved to Vegas like every other person in the 702. I was even more excited to see that most of the items on the menu were identical to the menu from the Norwalk location. Happy day!\n\nI can't even tell you what I ordered because I was in a food coma from start to finish. I left full, buzzed, and happy with money left in my pocket which is more than I can say for my departure from the rest of Vegas.\n\nThey also do take out so you can pre-order and get it to go. If you're staying on the strip there were plenty of cabs waiting outside to take people anywhere they wanted to go so don't fret if you want to venture out sans self-transportation. However you decide to get there - just go. Now.  I will absolutely go back the next time I'm in Vegas but this time I will do it with a reservation."

My Thai friend ordered all the dishes for us so that we could share family style. \n\nFirst off, this place is pricey. Secondly, the food is not worth the price both taste-wise and proportion-wise. So I won't come back, unless I'm with friends who want to go. Considering I got to try about 10 different dishes from here, I'm pretty sure my mind won't change. \n\nWe had various dishes. So here goes. Shrimp pad thai - according to my Thai friend, authentic pad thai is with shrimp. It wasn't bad, but the portion was really small. As a little Asian girl, I easily could've eaten the whole plate without sharing. I also didn't like how it didn't come with nice helpings of limes, vegetables, and peanuts on the side like how almost all the Thai places in southern California serve it. The noodles weren't cooked well and often clumped together. Good pad thai doesn't clump. Crispy pork - this was disgusting. I tried 2 pieces and had to discreetly spit it out into my napkin. It tastes like bone marrow. I know that sounds odd. But basically, the pork was fried so much that the meat and breading tasted like old bone marrow. Sounds gross? Well it was gross. Tom kah kai - the soup was not good. Usually this soup is really flavorful. This was bland. Drunken noodle - like the pad thai, the noodles here were not the perfect consistency. They were cooked too long and therefore clumped. Fish curry - according to my friend, this is a special dish that isn't often served because it's hard to make. Well if this place did it right, there's a reason why it's not often served; it's because it tastes like old fish flopping in mealy sauce. But it'll probably taste better somewhere else. Northern larb (pork) - it tasted like unseasoned ground pork. Wasn't impressed at all. Red curry with chicken - like everything else, it's not as flavorful as I've had at other places. I'm sure there were some other dishes I tried, and since I don't remember them, they probably didn't strike my fancy either. \n\nWhen I think of Thai cuisine, I typically think of complex flavors perfectly orchestrated together to create sweet and savory dishes that stimulate all your taste buds. I'm not sure how many times the word \"bland\" comes to mind when I think of Lotus of Siam. To me, that is an atrocity for Thai cuisine. And if the food wasn't bland, it's because it tasted gross instead, which means the flavors were jumbled and not properly managed. To top off the bad food, the prices weren't good. Each person barely had a full plate of food and had to pay $25. I could get more bang for my buck by going to a buffet.  \n\nThis place was very disappointing, considering the many reviews. But honestly, I should learn by now that I probably need to hold Las Vegas to a different standard from Los Angeles. It's like the dumber child that you just have to come to accept as it is."

Move away from the high priced strip restuarants and have yourself an adventure!  And don't be put off by the nasty mall it's in. It's down the row from the infamous Green Door (look it up) plus a myriad of other skanky businesses. Though I always like to go the the gay bar in the strip mall for a beer while waiting for my reservation time I think it's called Badlands."

One of our friends said that he thought it tasted better than what he had in Bangkok.\n\nFirst we ordered the Crispy Rice with sausage.  This was probably my least favorite dish, but everyone else loved it.  It has very strong mint and lime favors, and it's different than anything I've ever eaten.  It was my least favorite, but it was still good.\n\nThen he had the pad thai, northern red curry, and drunken noodle soft shell crab.  EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious.  The northern red curry looked more like a stew than a curry (I guess that's how they do it in northern Thailand?), but it was still very tasty!  The drunken noodle soft shell crab was AMAZING.  Just writing about it makes me want to drive back out to Vegas...\n\nA MUST-TRY whenever you're in town."

AT FIRST, it may seem like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. That's where the quote 'don't judge a book by it's cover' comes in.\n\nO M G the food is to DIE for, the service is amazing, wine cellar is crazy, and did I say the food is to die for?!?!\nI came with a large party of about 15 of us on a Saturday evening. Apparently there is quite a long wait here but I didn't wait at all. Perhaps you should go right when they open at 5:30 pm. \n\nFOOD\nI'm not exactly sure of the names of everything we ordered because the waiter recommended it all and we just went with the flow. We had a variety of dishes (3 of each one) that were all equally delicious and perfect in taste!!! My favorites were probably the Garlic Prawns (GIANT prawns perfectly battered and seasoned), the Crispy Duck Penang (oh my gosh), Papaya Salad (fresh, crispy salad), Pad Thai (just plain DELISH). \nThe CRISPY DUCK PENANG is seriously the bombbbbbbb. It's perfectly fried, juicy and the curry sauce is sooooo good omg. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. The Riesling wine was also delicious and went well with all of the food.\n\nSERVICE\nThe service was great! The servers constantly refilled our water and asked if we were enjoying our food. However, we were there for a birthday celebration and when he asked if he should bring out the cake, I told him we needed a bit more time but they brought it out with the candles lit (perhaps he misunderstood me..?). We had to ask him to blow it out and wait a little bit because we were waiting for the rest of our party to come back to their seats. After about 5-10 minutes he lit the candles again and started giving us the cake again even though we were still waiting for our party to sit back down so we just had to do the cake. This part was a bit rushed but it was fine. The service while we were dining was good and I have no complaints other than the cake incident haha.\n\nPARKING\nThere is a vast amount of parking as there is a hugeee lot out front. \n\nLotus of Siam is definitely a MUST TRY restaurant when you're in Vegas. I wish they had a location in Los Angeles T-T... I would go everyday!!!"

I didnt even really look at the menu since we arrived closer to closing and just ordered straight off of yelp suggestions: crispy rice, sea-bass drunken noodles, crispy duck, garlic prawns, seafood fried rice and steam rice.  After all that the bill for 3 people to our slight surprise was $100~ including tax and tip.\nThe food was really delicious though and I am looking forward to another visit.  I may not get the crispy rise though which was an interesting app but someone else in my party LOVED it?!

For years I've been hearing positive reviews about this place, and how the food is spectacular. My co-workers suggested we head over there to have me try their lunch buffet, which they told me they've enjoyed in the past. \n\nThe buffet setup is located in the central part of the older dining room. If I can recall, 15-20 items are served, from hot foods to desserts. I grabbed my plate and piled on the Pad Thai, egg rolls, tempura veggies and yellow curry chicken.\n\nPad Thai: Nothing to write home about.\n\nEgg Rolls: I'm hesitant when trying egg rolls at restaurants. For me it's hit or miss. The egg rolls I tried at Lotus were easily forgettable. Just your typical deep fried veggie egg rolls.\n\nYellow Curry Chicken: Too watery in my opinion, and not enough chicken, veggies, curry, or spices.\n\nTempura Veggies: Not even sure if the veggies were really tempura battered. Perhaps it was deep fried for too long, because they were too brown.\n\nFor dessert I tried the banana egg rolls, which is the best item from that buffet. I enjoyed the taste of the sweetened, finely shredded coconut combined with a ripened banana. \n\nI really wanted to give Lotus of Siam a great review, but the buffet food was mediocre.

The force (of hype) is strong with this one, and while it's almost always a good meal when I visit, it also almost always fails to meet my lofty expectations.  Is that something to hold against a restaurant?   If it's supposed to be one of the best in Las Vegas but turns out to just be yet another great Thai restaurant?  Maybe I should just get to the point and start talking about the food:\n\nBeen here several times, and almost each time I tried something different because unlike several people I know I AM NOT A SLAVE TO PARTICULAR DISHES.  Here's a list of what I can remember having and thoughts on each.  None of the appetizers I've had (Koong Sarong, prawns wrapped in bacon and deep fried / Mee Krob - crispy noodles with chicken and shrimp /  Nam Kao Tod - see all other reviews ) have blown my mind, but all were decent.  I don't really get the hoopla over the Nam Kao Tod.  Have none of ya'll ever had rice krispies before or something?   \n\nI've done a few of the soups and those were good.   Be careful on ordering those with heavy spice.  I swear one time I asked for a 5 /10 on some Tom Yum Kung and nearly passed out from dehydration after 3 sips.  Another time I got the Seafood Soup at a 7/10 and barely touched my water.  SHRUG.   Taste was fine on both, nothing to put it above and beyond any other Thai restaurants I've had.\n\nSalads I've tried include the Spicy Squid Salad (VERY hot @  7/10), and I liked that one a lot.  One thing I'll say is the ingredients always seem fresh which stands out in uncooked dishes like the salads.  I absolutely disliked the Spicy Shrimp Salad.  Whatever makes up their \"secret sauce\" simply has a flavor I do not enjoy, and it was DRENCHED with this.  No more secrets for me Saipin!  I'm onto you.  I also have had the Catfish Salad and Soft Shell Crab Salad.   Both of these were good, but ultimately not worth the cost.   One thing I should note is that I generally HATE salads, so maybe I should stop ordering them and talking about them in reviews.\n\nFor standard entrees I've mostly stuck with their Curries and have never been disappointed in any of them.   None have been made me completely forgo the competition around Las Vegas but they certainly rank among the best I've had.\n\nAt this rate all I've described would normally lead me to give a place a 3, but what makes me give it an end result of 4 is one thing and one thing only:  SEA BASS WITH DRUNKEN NOODLES.   FFS it's $29 but it's worth every penny and then some.  Just a spectacular dish that alone is worth 5 stars and would make me bump any review up a star.   Yes even the Post Office on Pebble and Bermuda."

I had a beef tartar that was SO spicy.  I asked for a solid 9/10 on the spice, and boy did it melt my face.  The server could see my tears of joy and pain, so brought a little bit of a sweet white wine to cool my mouth down.\n\nAfter scooping what was left of my face off the table, I had some of my gf's dish.  It was a seafood curry thing that was amazing as well."

Their chicken panang is the perfect amount of spicy, their stuffed chicken wings are a gift from the gods, and their wine selection is extensive.  I seriously would consider going back to Vegas just to eat here again.\n\n It's a nice change to have employees seem to genuinely care about what you're feeling like, and then help you pick out your dishes, explaining the menu to you.  Our waiter told us to not get item A because we already were getting items B, C, and D.  Instead he suggested E, and he was completely right.  :)\n\nI can't eat shrimp, but everyone else at my table LOVED the shrimp dish they got, so if you like shrimp, definitely try it!  (it was called Garlic Prawns)\n\nAnd they made an off-the-menu dessert combo for us because we couldn't decide what to choose--so sweet!  The fried banana was delicious, and the perfect end to a fantastic and super-filling meal.\n\nAlso, we sat one table over from Jennifer Tilly, which was kind of weird.  She played on her iPad like the whole time LOL"

            "review": "My cousin's bf had heard so much about this infamous Thai restaurant that he booked a 9pm reservation so that we could squeeze it in after our huge buffet lunch that day. My belly was bursting at its seams, but no complaints because this place was worth the extra calories.\n\nGood things:\n- Pad Kee Mow: This isn't one of the popular menu items, but I thought it was executed the best. The noodles had a nice texture to them and the flavor of the noodles were pretty good overall.\n- Crispy Duck with Panang Curry: The duck was just ok, but the curry was really tasty. The downside is that this dish is like $20 for a few measly pieces of deep fried bird.\n- Pad Thai: Another typical Thai restaurant item, but the noodles here are really thin and the color doesn't appear to be as artificially orange as at other places.\n- Service: They have really great service here. Waiters always stopped by to fill glasses of water and always with a smile. \n- Variety of choices: This restaurant's menu is literally a book. It is HUGE. Here you will find Thai dishes from all different regions, and all seemingly pretty tasty.\n\nJust ok:\n- Drunken noodles with crab: Most excited to try this, but the crab was disappointing. It was so fried that it was soft and soggy. \n- Nam Kao Tod: The crispy fried rice appetizer; this had a funky sour taste, but I was the only one at my table that didn't enjoy it so to each his own!\n\nThe good thing is that their menu is so extensive that picky eaters will have to find something to like. The not so good things are that portion sizes aren't huge for what you're paying for. Also, just to note, they make their food SPICY (even mild is hot hot hot), and if you make reservations there's a 5-minute grace period for your party to arrive by. Not so forgiving :/ Ultimately, I'm not sure if it's worth making a trip out of the strip for again, but worth a try!"

Fun decor inside. Service for lunch was fast and delicious. Had the garlic prawns and crispy duck with curry sauce. Both delicious and served fresh. Great execution. Check the menu before swinging by as they serve almost everything Thai here. Price point is high but if you can swing it, it's worth it. If you are looking to change up your Vegas trip with something new - try Lotus!"

My husband and I visited this restaurant for lunch and missed the lunch crowd thank goodness!  We ordered the pork satay which I really liked,  drunken noodles with prawns.. good but I thought the prawns were overcooked so they were chewy and they were not clean.. nothing like seeing that black stripe!  My husband liked them... he did agree they were overcooked but he said they're deep fried.. no excuse.. and he loved the crispy shell.  The noodles were good but I thought a bit chopped and sticky .. maybe that is normal.  We also had the chicken pad thai noodles.. i know I know.. typical american dish no real thai lover would order ... now.. I understand it should be spicy and it probably is really good to you heat seekers but the not spicy version... tasted like noodles tossed in ketchup.  For desert we ordered the fried banana and coconut ice cream which were separate orders we had them combine.  They were good together but I'm not sure I would have liked the bananas without the ice cream.  Would I go back.. I think I would and maybe try the buffet... should you try it.. I think you should .. especially if you like spicy food."

Beware of the spice though - it's hot! The waiters will give you a choice of spiciness on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nOur flight home wasn't until 11pm on Monday. We went here for dinner again on Monday.

Dishes here are more expensive than the usual Thai restaurant.  In Vegas, you are going to be shelling out tons of money all over the place.  Maybe cut back on a few drinks at the club or a few lap dances less to save a few bucks to try this spot out if it would make you feel better. \n\nYou will find some dishes here that you may not have encountered at other Thai restaurants.  This place gets real packed.  Non-stop taxi's dropping off people every minute it seems.  Make a reservation a day in advance if you have a large group.  There are very limited reservation slots.  \n\nOrdered the Sausage, Deep Fried Garlic Prawns, Fried Peking Duck in Panang, Thai Beef Salad, and Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  \n\nMy favorites are:\n\nDeep Fried Garlic Prawns - nicely fried, battered, and garlicky.  Enjoyed eating every part of the shrimp.  The skin is separated and deep fried as well.\n\nFried Peking Duck in Panang - I normally do not eat duck because it has a certain taste, but there are certain meats or dishes that you may not generally like, however, prepared a certain way and you might just fall in love with it.  I certainly enjoyed this dish.  Maybe because it was fried and sliced into thin pieces with thick skin.  Throw it in panang curry and perfect fusion flavor.  Some in the group thought it was a bit oily and greasy, but I did not mind.\n\nThai Beef Salad - rib eye beef, salad, and thai sweet lime dressing.  Tender beef, good sauce.  This was delicious. \n\nSausage and the Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass were good, but were my least favorite.  Sausage had a lot of flavor, but I did not find myself enjoying it more than other sausages that I've had.  Sea bass was cooked well, thick piece, but standard.  The noodles with deep fried soft shell crab sounds something more to my liking.  Maybe I will be back to order that someday."

My first visit was fairly good.  The place was packed.  The decor plain with tons of celebrities on the wall.\n\nMy second visit was probably two years ago.  I went with my boyfriend on a date night.  I decided to try some of the more interesting stuff, like tripe, etc.  Of course I was the only one eating these items as my boyfriend is a burger and fries kind of guy.  I think he ordered the Pad Thai.  I made him try a couple of bites.  I'm not sure what I ordered but it was good going down.\n\nA perfect date is not complete without a walk by the Bellagio fountain, which I insisted on.  However, not ten minutes after dinner, I warned my boyfriend that we needed to find a bathroom NOW!  My stomach hurt so badly I was afraid I wasn't going to make it.  We stopped at the first bathroom after the Bellagio self-park as I sat on the toilet balled over in pain.  We walked through the casino and I ran into the bathroom again only minutes later.  We caught a quick fountain show and I ran into the bathroom again.  That's three trips in ten minutes.  I'm sure the security guards thought I had a different \"problem\".  After we made it home, my boyfriend finally got going and spent a good part of the night in the bathroom.  Talk about pain.\n\nI'm not sure what I had eaten that had caused the upset stomach and, I have to say, I was really disappointed.  I will try it again but if I spend another night in the bathroom . . ."

For me it was the Roast Duck Red Curry with pineapple and a dash of coconut milk, preceded by an amazing salad of crispy Soft shelled crab tossed with shaved cabbage, lime, peanuts and fresh chili (10/10).  But wait, there's more!  Wine list is crazy extensive for an ethnic joint.

We ordered the chicken satay and agreed that it was the worst both of us have ever had (& coming from different cities, we've sampled our share of Thai food). The chicken was a semi-soft, almost artificial consistency and the seasoned exterior was somewhat slimy.  The flavor itself was average. Insert *blechh!*-faced emoji here...\nOur entrees were better, moving up to a solid, \"acceptable\". We ate them, but have had better. Mine was pad prik khing and hers was a curry shrimp dish.\nLastly, the dessert, coconut ice cream with sticky rice, was presented plainly (see pic), but really very good. As full as I was at that time, I didn't leave a grain of rice in that sadly empty little bowl.\nBottom line? \nProbably not worth the Uber trip cost, despite the fair prices. Stay on the strip."

The waiters/server were professional and attentive. The place was packed and it seems like everyone was enjoying their experience.  I ordered the pork pad Thai and it was good. The only complaint was that it wasn't as spicy as I'm accustomed to but it was still tasty.  The server offered to provide me with a spice tray but I didn't want to ruin it. Overall, I enjoyed it and I will definitely try it again."

Growing up in NY, I'm used to some of the best places being a hole-in-the-wall so this place makes me feel right at home.  This restaurant is surprisingly inexpensive when you consider the type of dining experience you get at other restaurants on the strip.  My favorites are the crispy rice, duck in red curry and my all time favorite is the Nua Yang Prik Thai Onn, which is sliced steak that is as tender as you can imagine, sauteed with red chili paste and peppercorns.  I go to a level seven on spicy, but I'm a little crazy.  They also have an AMAZING wine list.  My favorite pairing is the mango w/sweet sticky rice and a dessert Gewurztraminer.   YOU SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE A RESERVATION! DO NOT JUST SHOW UP FOR DINNER! YOU WILL NOT GET A TABLE!"

Amazing selection of German wine for very reasonable prices.  A perfect companion which cuts through the rich and intense flavors of many of the dishes here.  The menu is huge and I cannot claim to be an authority as an infrequent tourist, but the Nam Kao Tod is a fabulous appetizer.  Any variation of the Pad Kee Mao (particularly with crab) ordered spicy is amazing, but the my favorite dish here is the duck panang.  They fry strips of duck breast (breaded)  until crispy and then drizzle with a rich and distinctive panang which is far spicier than many editions I have had elsewhere.  Combine with a Donnhoff riesling and coconut ice cream to finish, and you have a fabulous treat of a meal...  Do not miss when in Vegas if you like Thai food."

Well, let me get started then!\n\nThis is one of must stop place in Vegas for me, and t should be your's too!\n\n2 things that I always order here:\n\n1. Tom Yum Ka - a little bite of sourness with a little bit of heat; a perfect balance of what a soup should be.  The chicken and mushroom inside also complements each other perfectly. It's a light soup, not heavy at all, so perfect for any day.\n\n2. Garlic Shrimp - cannot not find it any other Thai restaurants I've been to. It's basically fried shrimp with their secret seasoning. The shells are also fried until their extremely crispy, so you can actually eat it!  You MUST try this!\n\n3rd item always depends on my mood.  This time, it's chripy duck with drunken noodle. If you ever had pad see you, it tastes like that with lots of basil. The fried duck is crispy and moist, yummmoooo.\n\nIf you never had good Thai food before, this is the place to come. Oh, becareful the level of heat you asks for. If you can take spice, then there's nothing you need to worry about, but if you can, go 3 or lower!"

This was definitely my favorite. Normally with duck curry I see that the duck is swimming in curry, which leads to soggy skin. Not this dish! The curry was perfectly creamy and spicy, and they place the crispy duck on top so you have crispy skin with every bite. We shared this dish between 4 people, and I think I could have eaten the entire thing myself. I'd say splitting this dish between two people would leave someone hungry if you didn't have other dishes. \n\nGarlic Shrimp- Now I see why this dish has been mentioned over 200 times! The shell is taken off and fried along with the shrimp meat. So at first I was confused why my shrimp had no meat. The skin was crispy and unlike other places where you struggle to chew it, this version was easy to swallow. The garlic flavor doesn't shine through as much as I'd like, but I would still get this again.\n\nPad See Ew- Noodles were cooked well and the chicken wasn't dry. It was very good and I would order it again if I was in the mood. Next time I want to try the drunken noodles. I really liked the balance of flavors so I think the other noodle dishes will be good, too.\n\nService was very friendly. Even though it was busy we had our waters filled and were checked on multiple times. \n\nThe portions are a little on the small side for the price but what you get is pretty amazing. I had a hard time deciding whether I would give this place 4 or 5 stars, and I can't fault them for doing things well and charging more for it. \n\nExcited for our next visit!"

We had planned to have dinner at Pin-Kaow and originally planned  to meet at 6 PM, then delayed to 630, and finally 7ish was decided upon.  She called to let me know that she got a lot of work done and has a lot of free time.  We started talking about Pin Kaow and find out she she's been there.  I like her to have new experiences, so I asked if she would be interested in trying out Lotus of Siam.  An enthusiastic \"yes\"...\n\nIt's been 5 years since I'd been here and called to see if reservations are needed.  I spoke with a guy named \"Bank\" who later I found out is the Manager.  He said they are booked and walk in's may need to wait 20 minutes.  I asked if they had a bar and he said that they do have a bar.  (that's new since I was last there)...I then asked if there was a \"walk in\" list.  He took my name and added my friend and we were good to go.  \n\nLast time I was here a HUGE fight with around 15 people broke out in the parking lot.  The neighborhood is sketchy so have  your head on a swivel if you go.  When we arrived, there are what looks like patrons waiting outside for a table.  I was beginning to wonder how big the bar is.  We walk in and THEY EXPANDED!!!  They have a huge wine selection now!  Wow!  We announced our arrival and let them know we would be waiting in the Bar.  Everyone was very nice.  Zero, zip, nada attitude.  \n\nWe sat down, had ordered wine by that glass and were seated about 10 minutes later.  \n\nI usually order the same foods regardless of which Thai establishment we go to so I asked Joe, our Waiter, for his recommendations.  We ordered the NAM KAO TOD Crispy rice appetizer that's mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice..  I'm big on hot dogs/sausage, so Joe offered it made with Tofu.  Excellent decision.  For our main course we ordered a Northern Thai dish called Northern Laub, which apparently is ompletely different from the Issan larb in taste, this northern style larb (ground pork) is cooked with Northern Thai spices and no lime juice, garnished with fresh herbs and vegetables.  I think I would have preferred to have this made with Tofu too but didn't want to upset the Chef with too many changes.  However, I think it would ahve been cool if it did.  They are very accommodating.  I've almost been kicked out for making a suggestion at a SF Chinatown spot. Anyway, an finally, La Piste de resistance,  Khao Soi.  This typical Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle is served in curry sauce and coconut cream (your choice of beef or chicken), garnished with sliced red onion, lime and pickled vegetables.  All of these dishes can be made with a spiciness range from 1-10.  We ordered a 7 for all and the smoke was perfect...I could have gone to an 8, but it was a perfect dish at 7.  Do NOT eat the little red peppers in the dish or have water ready.  Ice water.  Oh, we also ordered the Thai Tea.  Very refreshing.  They do not have coffee there.  Well, they do have instant, but is that really coffee, is it?\n\nOh man...the La Piste de resistance is really the sample platter dessert.  It's comprised of Coconut ice cream, Sticky rice with Mango's (if you like the salty sweet thing then this is your thing), and Fried banana rolls drizzled with honey.  Menu diva at it again...we were full so didn't want a Cheesecake Factory sized dessert.  Joe hooked up a sample Sampler for us.  The very sweet dessert maker delivered it for us and reaffirmed that it was made smaller for us.  It was sill plenty of food though.  ( I promised my friend I would not mention that she ate 75% of each plate, though she claims more of a 50 50 split.  Hey, I'm not mad at her. A gurl's gotta eat, right?)   \n\nOur bill for the two of us was less than $50 and we got our grub and drink on big...well, at least she did...kidding of course...kind of...OKAY...I am kidding.  We both ate good.\n\nWhen I first moved here in 2001, I discovered Lotus of Siam listening to NPR.  The were saying how Gourmet Magazine chooses the top 10 restaurants in LV every year and every year, Lotus of Siam is selected.  How can one resist right?  The food was not awe inspiring, but I would not kick it out of bed for eating crackers either.  The food was 3 stars, the Service was 5 stars so I took an average of the two...(3+5)/2) is equal to 8/2 which equals 4...just in case...\n\nAlrighty then!!!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nChow!"

I've heard they get packed with lines out the door. The online reservation system doesn't seem to be the most accurate since they seem to only allocate a certain amount of seats to the online portal. We called in when they opened and they kindly informed us that there were plenty of seats available.\n\nWalking into the restaurant feels like you've entered an Anthony Bourdain rerun. The blatant glass wine cellar that lines the central walkways pose a simple question. Does wine go with Thai food?\n\nI didn't dare to try. Instead, we opted for the Khao Soi with Crispy Duck, Garlic Prawns, a side of sticky rice, and for dessert: mango sticky rice.\n\nThe Khao Soi is unbelievable. I've been searching far and wide in the West Coast for Northern Thai Khao Soi. The type with the unmistakably scrumptious broth, perfectly cooked wide-egg noodles, and a winged-meat pair served directly inside the creamy dish. In Chiangmai, I caught a bowl of Khao Soi flanked with a chicken leg at the train station and even that was impressively amazing. This bowl of yellow curry noodles is truly a portal into my travels through Northern Thailand. The boneless crispy duck is a flawless touch with just the right amount of crunch and flavor you'd expect from the winged-cousin.\n\nGarlic Prawns are cool. The way they prepare it is rather interesting. They splice the prawn along it's shelled-back and dig out the meat from within the shell. They keep the shell attached to the shelled-fish as they fry it and it becomes a crunchy butterfly. Dressed heavily with garlic and served with a side of rice, this dish was the perfect pair with the curry noodles.\n\nPro-tip: use the extra curry from the Khao Soi for the Garlic Prawn's rice for a moist addition to the fried dish.\n\nLastly, the mango sticky rice with coconut cream is the perfect way to end the meal. The juxtaposition of warm coconut rice with a cold mango gives an ice cream dessert a run for its money.\n\nGo here if you've traveled through Northern Thailand. Go here if you want to travel to Northern Thailand. Just Pokemon Go here."

They don't even try to be hip.  \n\nThe menu has a wide selection without being overwhelming.\n\nThe food is sooo goood. Nuff said.  You have to try it to believe it. \n\nThe price is more than fair.  They can charge significantly more and diners will continue to line up.  Yes, their food is THAT good!!\n\nThe service is fast and quick, without the feeling of being rushed.  \n\nNotable mentions:  chili basil beef/chicken, drunken noodles, pad see ew, Thai green papaya salad, mango and sticky rice."

This was my first visit, but I'm already looking forward to eating here the next time I come to Vegas.\n\nMy favorite dish was Koong Char Num Plar: raw prawns served with lime, chili paste,  garlic slice, mint leaf, & a flavorful fish sauce. It was a simple dish with well balanced, complex flavors. \n\nI also ordered fried fish cakes (appetizer), panang (curry), and a jack fruit dish with fish (northern). For dessert I had fried banana & coconut ice cream. The bananas were wrapped in a sheet which reminded me of fried egg rolls; it was tasty and different than expected."

We drove to the restaurant in a small SUV on the freeway on a Saturday night. We arrived at 6:00 without a reservation. The kind, little Oriental woman who greeted us said the wait would be 60 minutes. We were shoveling delicious Thai food down our throats by 6:30. During our surprisingly short wait, we met a great man named Terry who washed our windows. Our waiter Joe recommended several delicious dishes to try. The menu has tons of options and you will not believe the wine cellar. I felt like I walked out of a Burmese jungle and into the Napa Valley by simply walking from my table to the restroom. I ordered the khao soi and it was stupid fresh and tender. The real highlight of our visit was when the world renowned funny man, Jim Belushi waltzed in. Do not let the long waits sway your decision. I'm not saying this is the best food in Las Vegas; I'm saying this is the best food in the world. We had coconut ice cream and sticky rice with mangos for dessert. We departed from the restaurant and drove home with grateful hearts and full bellies."

It was strange - the restaurant is on the street, and looks almost as if it's closed and abandoned.  If you drive around to the back, you find the strip mall with the actual front of the restaurant.  The mall is strange - there are a few other restaurants and an eclectic bunch of stores and other things.\n\nDon't let the looks of the mall get to you - the restaurant is lovely inside.  Service was great from the moment we were seated.  \n\nWe decided to get what everyone else suggested - the Garlic Prawns.  We started with the Chicken Satay, which was one of the best versions I can remember having.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the satay sauce was perfect.\n\nWe also ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp.  Once again, it was one of the best versions I can remember having.  \n\nThe Garlic Prawns came to the table, and we were a bit surprised.  We knew it was supposed to be crispy, but we didn't realize the shrimp shells were fried separately.  It was a strange-looking dish, but on our first bite of the crispy shells, we understood.  It's like shrimp chips - not those pastel colored things they call \"shrimp chips\" - but actually potato-chip-like chips made from deep frying the shrimp shells.   It was like nothing I have ever had before - and it was amazing.  The shrimp themselves were wonderfully done as well, but I am not really sure which part of the dish I enjoyed more - the shrimp or the shells.\n\nI guess we will just have to go back again sometime to figure it out :)\n\nWe are so glad we saved an evening for this place during our vacation."

The staff is nice despite obviously being super busy & the service is super fast!!!\n\nNow let's get to the good part. The food... OMG the FOOD!!!

Each dish will make you first salivate, then extremely happy at first bite AND then pissed that you can't (or maybe you can) eat here every single day!\n\nCHARBROILED PRAWNS\nWith fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce, topped with fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce\n\nCHICKEN LARB\nGround chicken chopped onion, green chili, and lime juice. served with fresh cabbage\n\nCRISPY DUCK\nServed on a bed of egg noodles in a curry base sauce, garnished with sliced red onions, lime and pickled vegetables\n\nCRISPY RICE\nCrispy rice with lime, tender bits of sausage, crunchy peanuts, and wispy slices of green onion\n\nSEA BASS\nWith fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce, topped with fresh chili, garlic and lime sauce\n\nIn addition we get classic Thai dishes like, Panang Curry Chicken & Shrimp Drunken Noodles\n\nIf in season, definitely top off your dinner with some Mango & Sticky Rice for dessert...

Haven't found a better Thai place in NY, Boston, or San Francisco (and it's not even close). \n\nI've had the garlic prawns (dreamy dish, HUGE shrimp, crispy shell), tom yum (deep, sour lemongrassy flavor), crispy duck penang (awesome though small for what you pay - maybe 8 strips of fried duck with sauce for over $20. devoured it), soft shell crab drunken noodle (really good), sea bass noodle (absurdly delicious), and more. I hear the dessert is really good too. \n\nDon't miss out on this place. Also, if you don't enjoy heat ask for level 2 (of 10). Don't go above 3 unless you want a hot dish. 6+ will knock your socks (and palate) off."

No water or beverage was offered.  I finally got up and took a glass from a water station and helped myself.  The buffer while ok was not monitored and refilled timely.  I made two separate trip 15 min apart for the green chicken curry. Neither time was it refilled. Just a few sad pieces of zucchini floating in sauce.  The same applied to the tempera.

It was cool with us because we weren't that hungry and they let us put our number down so they will call us when it's ready and we can then decide if we still wanted to come. The wait turned out to be only about 1hr. I had imagined the place to be rather small since the waiting area was pretty tight. It was pretty cool to see all the news article written about the place.\n\nThe food there was absolutely delicious. I actually think about the food I ate there still pretty much every day. We ordered a lot of the recommended items yelpers suggested. The Drunken Noodle Garlic Prawn shrimp was amazing! The prawns were freaking goood! It was 22 dollars but so worth it! The Nam Cam Tod...i think that's what it's called was also very unique. Never had anything like it before but it was so very good. For a group of 5 we ordered Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp, Drunk Noodle Garlic Prawn, Drunken Noodle with Seafood, Pineapple fried rice, Nam Kom Tod. Our bill came out to be 125 and we had a lot of leftover that we ate later that night. I'm for sure going back to this place next time and recommending to all my friends!"

We ordered a bottle of burgundy style Pinot noir that was heavenly. We arrived on time for out reservation and were seated and greeted promptly. *Be on time or they will give your table away if you're later than five min*. \n\nThe wine list... Insane. Pages and pages of wine... Unbelievable. I definitely would recommend ordering a bottle, considering the price per glass. Once you taste the food, you will definitely understand why. \n\nThe service was wonderful. We never ran out of water and there was someone constantly checking on us. I love that. \n\nThe ambiance... Way way way too bright. I felt like I was in a hospital. The lights... Just too much. No table decor. No candles. Paper placemats. The decor was really dated. And considering their extensive wine list, I was expecting more umph. But it was okay. \n\nThe food... Left so much to be desired. We had a jack fruit vegetable curry. It was more like overly spiced watery vegetable soup. We usually order a 7 or 8 in spice. We love heat. The 7 was almost un edible. Beware. The curry wasn't sweet at all... Just really really watery and hot. I'm not use to this style of Thai and obviously not a fan. The rice... It was good, but they gave one small bowl for the four of us. We order three meals. (Our friends were not impressed either). The price of the food is fitting for the ambiance. Will I return? Maybe for a birthday, but never on my own. We will stick to komol (same shopping center). They have the style of Thai I prefer apparently... And their food is just... It's so good. \n\nGive this place a shot and form\nYour own judgments though. Happy yelping."

That was my SO's reaction as we drove by, but trust me stop find parking in this run down strip mall, brave the characters outside, look straight ahead and go in the restaurant.  \n\nWe ordered two dishes, I just wished we were with a bigger party so that we could have tried more dishes.  I ordered the braised short ribs... love me tender, tender meat!!!  And the SO ordered the pork stew northern curry.  Both were lovely the Pork stew had a good bite, a bit spicier that I would like but I still enjoyed it.  It was a bit odd that the waiter didn't ask how hot we wanted it but to me that's sometimes a good sing of a great restaurant.  I like it we a chef prepares a dish how it should be enjoyed no matter who's taste bud is eating it.  The best part of the pork stew dish was that the pork pieces had just a bit of fat yup pork fat in it.  I know it's bad for you and also know that a lot of people hate the texture/taste of it, but what can I say, I'm filipino and we just love that stuff.  \nWe also ordered the sticky rice and mango... big mistake as this push us over the top and almost exploded as I made my way out of the restaurant.  I don't know if it was just the fact that I was too full but the desert did not really impress me too much.  Pretty standard sticky rice/mango one can find in other good Thai place.\nI would give this place 5 stars if not for the location.  Great food nice space inside very reasonable prices.  A must when you want really good food and not willing to pay the price associated with a \"celebrity chef's\" name plastered on a restaurant.  So pass the buffet line and go straight to LOS."

Was waiting to be \"blown away\"  and \"wow-ed\" by the food, and I was not.\n\nBut then, after 3 or 4 forkfuls (chopsticks not available--Thais don't use them), I realized that it really WAS good.  Not \"out of this world\", but darned good!  Fresh, high quality ingredients, DONE WELL.  Very nicely done.  Very tasty.\n\nWine and beer menu was awesome.  If you stop in the lobby you can see the many \"honorable mentions\" and articles about them in magazines such as Food and Wine, Gourmet, Los Angeles Food, etc.  They have won two James Beard awards.\n\nTrying to find the place-- we are tourists in Vegas-- we drove to the address in our rental car, and it looked like a place that NO ONE would dare enter... vacant, dirty, abandoned and horrible.  But alas, that was the back way.  The front is not much better, actually.  But it is in a strip mall (off the \"Strip\") with Japanese, Indian, Mexican and Karoake restaurants nearby.\n\nPhad See Ew, Phad Thai, Calamari salad, were fabulous as was Thai shrimp soup, the crispy rice appetizer, and geez-- I forget what else we had-- 9 dishes in all.  But it was darned good.  A nice place to get away from the glitz and high prices of the Strip.   Nice, even service.  Atmosphere pleasant.\n\nPhotos on the walls of celebrities who have eaten here.  I do see why.. it really does do Thai food very very well.  Worth going off the Strip for a \"real meal\"."

            "review": "I was a bit skeptical leaving The Strip and coming to a deserted parking lot at about 9:00 pm.  I was blown away by the groups of people waiting by the entrance door of the restaurant.  We made out way past the people and found even more inside the waiting area.  We managed to put our names down on the wait list, and the hostess said it would be a thirty minute wait.  We decided we would leave, explore outside, and then come back later.  \n\nDon't judge us for what we decided to do next.  Just a few steps away was a massage parlor.  The GF and I decided to treat ourselves with a thirty minute foot massage.  I wonder if the massage place gives the restaurant a cut of the profits, since I can imagine a lot of the customers also eat there.  The massage was not that great, but that is another review for a different day.  \n\nWe came back to the restaurant seven minutes after they had called, informing us that our table was ready.  We were seated fairly close to the entrance, next to a secluded room.  The interior of the dining establishment looked quite remarkable.  Everything looked new, and well maintained.  The exterior was very  misleading.  You would never expect to see such grand chandeliers, a vast wine selection, and well kept furniture.  \n\nWe decided to order the fried wontons to start, thai fried rice and khao soi for our main course, and for dessert, we had the fried bananas with coconut ice cream.  The fried wontons were just okay tasting.  I enjoyed their homemade sweet and sour sauce.  As for the wonton , they were a tad overcooked, causing them to dry out. The skin to meat ratio was disproportionate. This was the only item that I felt was not worth the price.  \n\nWe ordered the thai fried rice without tomatoes, and with a fried egg on top.  Our server even repeated all the items we ordered back to us.  Somewhere along the way, this was not communicated to the kitchen.  Not surprisingly, there were tomatoes everywhere!  So, we sent it back, and hopefully there was no spit in the new one we received.  I am almost positive they used the same egg from our old one because it was only room temperature.  Overall, the thai fried rice was delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly.  With the slide of the knife, the yolk oozed everywhere.  \n\nThe khao soi was definitely the star of our meal.  Be warned that a 6 is super spicy.  You get to choose the spiciness level from 1-10.  It was so good though.  The curry broth had so much explosive flavor.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, and all the ingredients inside the bowl complimented each other perfectly.  My favorite part of the dish was the coconut curry, hands down.  \n\nFor dessert, there are three options.  They are ice cream, fried bananas, and mango sticky rice.  We decided to get the ice cream AND fried bananas, which are two desserts.  I have to admit, I have not ever seen fried bananas served without ice cream.  It was surprising that people order it by itself.  When it finally arrived, we were already so full.  I wish there was more ice cream to go with the bananas.  We finished the ice cream with about four more banana pieces left.  \n\nOverall, a very good dining experience.  It was quite nice to get away from The Strip.  Out of the less than ten times I have been to Vegas, this was my first time eating outside  casinos and away from the gambling addicts.  It was a pleasant experience, and I can see why this place is doing so well."

And as always, it is always hard to meet the hype and it fails a tad here at Lotus of Siam.  Why?  Mainly because the dishes seemed rushed out and you can taste a lack of that sweet care from the chef.  Understandable though because they need to turn tables as fast as possible due to such high demand.\n\nSo many famous people have come here, yes, its one of those places as you enter you see all the pictures on the wall of who's who that's has dined here.  The wine selection is stellar as you see it the moment you hit the dining room.  The Service is great, the hostesses are pleasant.  Now to the food.\n\nPapaya Salad - Solid.  The spice associated with the salad was mouthwatering.  This is a dish to order always as it starts it all off perfectly.  It is clean, light, fresh, prepares you for the rest of dinner.\n\nKhao Soy (Crispy Duck, Egg Noodle) - Now this dish is quite stellar.  It is the Northern Thai variant of Khao Soy.  The duck is crispy, but not like the garlic shrimp, more like a crispy, breaded type.  It is succulent, tender, just perfect.  Egg Noodles are perfect and the yellow coconut curry goes all perfectly together.  This is one of those dishes I can have 2-3x a week and I look forward to most when coming here.\n\nCrispy Garlic Shrimp - The hypness hits a roadblock here.  The most famous dish here.  You expect it to be jaw dropping, mouth watering.  It isn't.  The skin is perfectly done to a crisp (you eat it), and the shrimp are of a good size (see picture).  For what most everyone raves about here, I will say it is good, it is tasty, but the star of the restaurant?  Only for people who are novels to it.  Would I order it again?  Yes.  But I would tell my table its one of the entrees that are good here, not the, \"OMG WE HAVE TO ORDER THISSSSSS.\"\n\nPanang -  Decent.  Nothing to write home about.\n\nGreen Curry - Forgettable.  Wait, we had green curry?\n\nSea Bass -  Totally overpriced and small portion.  Skip this.  Nuff said.  This dish is almost a whole Star doc worthy.\n\nFried Banana with Coconut Ice Cream Dessert - Delicious.  Small chunks of banana fried in an egg roll style.  The delicate thin crispiness was very well appreciated by my mouth.  The coconut ice cream was light and heavenly.  Must Order Dish.\n\nVibe - Great.  The whole place is hummin along, happy, eatin, drinkin, laughing.  It is like all my Thai friends.  \n\nThe menu here is huge.  North and South.  Most of the good dishes seem to come from Northern menu.  We enjoyed it here but like I said, the dishes seemed rushed, but for understandable reasons.  Glad to have tried it.  Come back on next Vegas trip?  Probably not (mainly because Vegas has so many options).  \n\nBut damn that Khao Soy callin my name......"

The restaurant was hard to find. Like most places in Vegas that is off the strip, this place is in a sketchy part of town in a very run down strip mall. But people in the know have no problem finding the place. We were lucky to come on a Tuesday night and did not have to wait for a table. The menu is extensive. There are so many things that sound so good and I wish I could try everything. I really had a hard time choosing so I asked the waiter for recommendations. He was extremely nice and really helpful. With his help, we ordered the drunken noodles with prawns and a pork curry that had some Burmese influences. The drunken noodle dish was mind blowing. The noodles were topped with giant prawns, I think there was 7 or 8. The prawns were huge! And it was deep fried and they separate the shell enough so it is easy to eat the shrimp but still intact enough to make it look like a butterfly. Great presentation. The deep fried shell tastes like shrimp chips, so yummy! The prawns are very tender. There's so much of this stuff that the noodles are dwarfed in comparison. The noodles were also really tasty. It would have been fine if this was a stand alone dish. I don't think I have had drunken noodles this good. The pork curry was also really distinctive. The spices are very rich and unexpected. The pork was tender and flavorful. This is not your typical thai restaurant or typical Americanized thai food. Really great experience. There has been comparisons with this and Kin Khao in SF. I can tell the flavors are of the same region, and I can see the similarities. However, I think Lotus takes the prize, if not for its no nonsense simplicity vs KK's over fancified SF style presentation. Just purely on experience since Lotus has been around for so much longer."

            "review": "This local favorite has earned a national reputation for its great Thai food. Although I have ordered off the menu a few times, I usually go to Lotus for their lunch buffet, and that's what we did today.\n\nAt first glance, the buffet doesn't look like much -- especially when compared to other buffets offered on the Strip. But for $10.99, you get a pretty thorough representation of traditional Thai offerings. I'm not sure if the selections change daily, but today there was no beef or seafood; however, there were plenty of chicken, tofu, and vegetable dishes to go around. There was also a lot of fried fare, including egg rolls, shrimp and curry puffs, tempura vegetables, and fried banana (basically, a banana egg roll). \n\nI steered clear of the fried food and headed straight for the chicken noodle soup, which is one of my favorite things at Lotus. I don't think this is on the regular menu, and it's not what you would consider traditional chicken noodle soup, but I could eat this all day. It looks like a hot and sour soup with ground chicken and wide rice noodles, but it has a hint of spice (anise?) that's addictive. I've had this with duck on the buffet before and it was fantastic, but this is almost as good. My husband was not as pleased with the egg drop soup, which could more appropriately be called \"cilantro soup with egg.\" (He has that weird gene where cilantro tastes like soap, so any cilantro at all is too much for him. I love cilantro, but it was a little overwhelming for me, too.)\n\nThe main courses included pad thai, pad woo sen, curry chicken, chow mein, and ginger tofu (listed in order of my preference). There are orange slices and cantaloupe for dessert along with the aforementioned banana egg roll. (I consider this last item a dessert option. Don't be like my husband and mistake it for a savory dish -- it sure tastes crappy with soy sauce on it!)\n\nNewbies and foodies may want to order off the extensive menu, but for anyone in search of a quick and tasty Thai lunch, I suggest trying the buffet (if, for nothing else, one of the best soups in town)."

(seriously whatever they're doing here to fry their food is amazing haha)\n\ntotally amazing lunch and was a great start to our weekend in vegas! the restaurant is pretty pricey but definitely worth it!"

The sea bass options on the menu are all solid as well.  If you order the typical noodle/rice/curry dishes that are available at other Thai restaurants, you will not be impressed and you will feel you have over paid.  The Northern Thai menu is also delicious and adds a little variety compared to other Thai restaurants in the area....while the menu states the dishes are more mild...they still left my mouth on fire.\n\nLotus also has a buffet lunch option.. especially if you are on a time crunch.  Very basic dishes like pad thai, pad see ew, vegetable curry, and assortment of fried foods (tempura, chicken wings, egg rolls) are set out in the middle of the restaurant and constantly filled.  The stand out items in the buffet lunch are the fried chicken wings and the coconut/banana egg roll.  For the price you pay...definitely worth a try!"

Someone here on Yelp said crispy duck in curry is life changing, and he/she is right.  We paired it with Panang, our favorite curry.  Breathtaking.  Crispy garlic shrimp were also mind altering.  Tom Ka Gai soup perfect.  Spicy garlic wings perfect. Scallops in red curry perfect. Khao Soi (Northern) perfect. Spicy seafood fried rice perfect.  My only regret is I know not when I will be able to go again as I live elsewhere.  If I lived there I would go several times a week.  Try it.

F.S.W.\n\nBut I did remember to take pictures dear readers and I can say everything we ordered was not only downright delectable but tasted just as good, if not better, than anything that I ate in the four weeks I spent in Thailand.\n\nYes. I said it. And I stand by it with my FlavorBoner held high.\n\n\nNam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip w/ ground pork) intended to be a starter to your meal, is not too spicy and has just the right amount of sweet from the ground pork. It is awesome with the crudit\u00e9s and chicharones served with it. The cool from the vegetables and the heat from the dip work really well together, even for a drunk ass like myself.\n\nHey. It was a long drive, all right, and I was on a mission. So... whatever.\n\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice) The center of the rice was perfectly moist and soft and the outside was sensationally crunchy. How they did that I have no idea. There was an overall wonderful ginger/lime flavor going on in this dish with flame coming from the green onion and fresh chilies.  Yum!\n\n\nSai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) Fresh, house made, Thai spicy pork sausage. Enough said. Either you get it or you don't. No need to sell it.\n\n\"A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy!\"\n\n-- Alec Baldwin, Glengarry Glen Ross\n\nGarlic Prawn. Deep fried in their shell, this dish has a potato chip crunch to it and it's so frickin' garlicky. And I mean that in the best possible way. This is a not to be missed dish for those of you who do not dig anything with hoofs.\n\nThen there was our little crispy drunken Daffy, the Crispy Duck Drunken Noodle. The skin on the bird was indeed crispy and salty. Her meat tender and juicy. The vegetables were cooked yet firm and the bird-based broth that the slippery, wide noodles bathed in was the perfect compliment to the other spicy dishes as it smoothed everything out.\n\nNow not all of the dishes we ordered were from the Northern Thai portion of the menu that everyone recommended, some were chef's choices others, like the drunken noodle, were personal favorites.\n\nJust order what you want. It's your meal. Everything here will be good. You are not going to go wrong."

            "review": "The claim that this is the best Thai food outside of North America is no exaggeration. Fourish years ago I visited Thailand for a school sponsored trip and have been searching for decent Thai food ever since in the states and have failed miserably time and time again.  Every restaurant either lacks spice in their food (which is absolutely essential for this cuisine) or is simply way too greasy for consumption. But Lotus of Siam's dishes are nice and spicy, fresh, and well prepared. Even better, there are items on this menu that I have not seen anywhere else since I've been back from Thailand. When I was there I ordered the beef jerkey as an appetizer, sea bass, and sticky rice for dessert. All were very tasty, and I must mention that the sea bass literally melted away in my mouth. All in all I am very glad I came here during my trip in Vegas. Totally worth the cab ride (its off the strip) but only five minutes away. \n\nAs a sidenote though, MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION. Even in the middle of the week they are completely packed for dinner and lunch. Don't miss out!"

Within 10 minutes we had our apps.  However, we watched other tables pay their bills, new folks get seated, and have food served before our main entrees came.  We waited at least an hour before our waiter (who was running around working hard all night) noticed we didn't have our food.  His excuse was that the kitchen was packed.  We believed this because the restaurant was packed, but he wasn't telling the truth because other tables who were seated after us were finishing up their meals and paying their bills.  Kind of a bummer not to be comped on anything when it was clear our order was messed up somehow.  I know accidents happen, but admit it!  I still gave 4 stars because the wait staff was very nice and friendly and the food was unbelievable, unlike any Thai I've had.  I'd definitely go back!"

Today, on a whim, we decided to finally check the place out.\n\nPad See Ewe w/chicken (4.5/5)\n\nVery tasty and full of flavor, this is the dish I was most impressed with during my meal. Just the right combination of sweet and salty. Portion was just moderate, not generous but also not too small. I enjoyed the pad see ewe very much and will definitely order it again.\n\nLarb (1.5/5)\n\nQuite the disappointment, both in terms of taste and portion size. First of all, the portion size was surprisingly miniscule and left me wanting more food. Not necessarily more of this larb, just more of some kind of food. Taste was also a let down as the portion tasted very bland. No more larb from LOS for me.\n\nService (3/5)\n\nWe apparently went during the lunch rush, so it was quite busy. The service was adequate, but nothing outstanding. Granted, they were slammed, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAmbiance/ Room (2/5)\n\nI dig enjoy the wine cellar and bar area. Very cool. Otherwise, it seemed like an old, tacky mish mosh of items. Plus the tables are squeezed in too tight together, IMO. I could easily hear conversations around me with no effort at all. Plus the actual location is in a pretty sketchy area to begin with.\n\nAlthough it did not live up to the hype, it was still pretty good. We have already decided we are definitely coming back to try other menu items and hopefully that will happen during a slower time. \n\n3 stars.\n\nA-Ok."

I don't blame them though; I would probably wait 4 hours if I didn't have to be back in LA that night  \n\nThis place is simply amazing. Very authentic Thai food. I'm from LA, and LA is known to have a lot of amazing Thai places but none of them compare to Lotus. The restaurant is huge, and they have a bar that offers everything from wine to sake & beer. Over the years they've expanded the space to probably accommodate the amount of people they serve each day.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nCrispy Prawns in Garlic\nIt's as amazing as it sounds. When they say crispy, they mean crispy! You can actually eat the shrimp skin. It's like chips. Try it, you won't regret.\n\nCrispy Duck Panang\nHere's the thing: I don't eat duck. I'm not sure why, but I just kinda feel weird about eating it. However, this dish is an exception. The duck is so crispy, and the sauce is so good and has the perfect kick. I wish all duck dishes could taste as good as this. Have it with white rice and you're a winner without hitting it big on the strip.\n\nPad see ew \nMy 1st love. \nBest pad see ew that I have ever had. It's simple, not too oily, not too dry and a lot of flavor. The beef: tender! \n\nAnother thing to note about this place is the service. Despite that the girl at the front desk isn't very personable or quick to greet guests, the waiters and the waitresses make up for it. They really want you to enjoy their food. Never was my glass empty. \n\nTHANK YOU LOTUS OF SIAM FOR ANOTHER AMAZING EXPERIENCE."

This makes for an easy cab ride. We made it there just before the lunch hours ended. That actually worked out well because it meant we had no wait time whatsoever. We decided to order several menu items and share, although it takes 10-15 minutes just to flip through the extensive menu. Everything sounded amazing, but we settled on the Issan Sausage, Kraphao Moo Krob, and Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab.\n\nThe Issan Sausage is their housemade grilled sour pork sausage (complete with a secret blend of ingredients), served with fresh chili, ginger, and peanuts. Delicious doesn't even begin to describe this dish. There were hints of sweetness and acidity throughout, and each bite was packed with flavor.\n\nI also loved the Kraphao Moo Krob, which is stir-fried crispy pork belly with Thai basils, bell peppers, and minced dry and fresh chilis. The pork belly was spectacular, and the thai basil added a great dimension to the dish. I only wish there had been more of it.\n\nThe Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab is a deep-fried soft shell crab with homemade fresh chilis and Thai basil, served atop pan-fried flat rice noodles. We ordered the medium heat level, and that was just hot enough. It was very tasty, and I enjoyed the crispy crab coupled with the juicy noodles.\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic lunch spot that won't break the bank, definitely try out Lotus of Siam."

Hey man, some of the best local eateries are tucked between a massage parlor and a wig shop. \n\nI'm not the biggest Thai food fan,  but I know what I like, and I LOVED this. Everything tasted incredible. We ordered the sum thom salad, which was generously vinegary, and a steaming bowl of tom khai coconut soup, level 7, which was a deeply revelatory experience to everyone at the table. Two of my party even declared pre-soup that they hate coconut-based concoctions, but after trying one spoonful they were ladling it out right fast. We found level 7 to be satisfyingly spicy without being bland. For an entree I ordered the pork panang curry, level 7. Delicious. Not the best in the world, and the pork was a little bland, but it was oddly comforting food. I would have preferred it a little spicier, but I suspect they think white ladies are lying when they ask for hot and spicy food. Girl I am not lying: I like my spicy! For drinks we ordered a flight of Riesling, which perfectly complemented the food. This is a must purchase for any spicy meal. \n\nLotus of Siam you are delicious.

This might help: it is right next door to Namaste Indian.  The restaurant is one of many that line a massive deserted parking lot that will make you think twice about getting out of your car, but inside the feeling was totally different.  \n\nThe servers were super friendly and helpful, and there were sane people there, sitting at tables, wearing clothes, on lunch breaks from office jobs or sober enough today to make it a few miles off the strip with cheerful faces, the ability to form coherent sentences, and the sense to seek out real food at reasonable prices.  What a relief!\n\nI'm not a fan of buffet, and looking at this one didn't change my mind.  The selection was limited and the items looked like typical buffet food.  However, for those interested, the couple of main entrees looked decent and smelled good, and the $8.99 it costs seems more than fair.  \n\nI opted for the menu and was completely satisfied.  Interestingly, they have a northern Thai food section, and I got the first dish listed.  It is an egg noodle dish served in a red coconut curry broth.  Even though it wasn't on the menu I was able to get tofu instead of chicken or beef.  The bowl of steaming sweet, spicy, sour, and creamy deliciousness is topped with cilantro, green onion, and a few fried noodles and served with a plate of \"sliced\" red onion, pickled cabbage, and a lime wedge.  The broth was absolutely delicious!  I savored each spoonful, and before I knew it had eaten the entire bowl.  It was the perfect portion for lunch.  \n\nAs for the garnish, the pickled cabbage had an interesting earthy taste underneath the vinegar, but I don't know what vegetable it was exactly.  The server thought it might be napa.  The only thing I would change would be the red onions which I think would have been much better if they were actually sliced rather than coarsely chopped as they were.  I love just about any vegetable ingredient, but huge chunks of raw onion are an exception.  \n\nMy general feeling for this place is gratitude and affection.  The food was excellent, the servers earnest, and the atmosphere perfect for decompressing from the chaos of the strip.  I would definitely come back if I happened through Vegas again, but then I might get too curious about the neighboring restaurants..."

(We call it that because you have Thai, Korean, American and Mexican themed restaurants and businesses all in one place). \n\nThe waiter was probably what really made this place special. He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (We ordered a bottle, and he confirmed to see if we knew what it was we were ordering...we did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the German Riesling. My wife had the Panang Curry (at an 8 spicy level, which she said was perfect) with noodles and I had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as my wife and I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since, and may be in one of my top 5 meals ever.\n\nThe food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant.

My first visit was for lunch, and they used to offer a buffet, which I recommend against because you really want to try their entr\u00e9e dishes. The buffet itself was just average. This time around we tried:\n\n-Thai Iced Coffee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw): Not my favorite- this was really dark/strong tasting, and too sweet for my liking.

I've had a much better version from Sticky Rice in the Bay Area. Skip!\n-Khao Soi Braised Short Rib (Northern Thai Egg Noodle Served in Curry Sauce, Coconut Cream w/Braised Short Ribs Garnished w/Sliced Ted Onions, Lime, Pickled Vegetables, $22.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#LgHpnSwICwKPgyrxHLQ2NA): Pretty good, but the braised short rib was a bit overcooked, and too lean. Most of the pieces were really tender, but the dish overall was bland, although the curry was good.

The prawn shells were super crispy/crunchy, and flavorful. The shrimp pieces were gigantic, and cooked perfectly. This dish made the dinner!\n-Crispy Duck Topped w/Fresh Homemade Chili & Thai Basil, Served on Top of Pan Fried Flat Noodles/Drunken Noodles, $25.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=L1RxxA7RkHmEuwiMCXXTsw#Gec8FZpK3d7Z-iXQs5QLDw): Pretty good, although I didn't think the crispy duck went that well with the drunken noodles, and they give you the tiniest portion of drunken noodles ever. I did like the crispiness of the duck, and the preparation was very unique- something I've never eaten before. I would recommend trying the crispy duck for sure, but not on top of the drunken noodles. \n\nService was efficient, and our food came out pretty quickly. Their dishes are definitely on the pricey side for Thai food, but the Garlic Prawns really makes up for all of their other misses. Their menu is so extensive that it's hard to narrow down your order, so I hope to be back again in the future to try out more dishes!

The portions aren't as huge as you're probably used to from other Thai places, but that was enough to fill two people up. \n\nThe Crispy Duck Panang was the clear highlight of the meal -- tender duck, crisp skin, spicy & creamy panang sauce. On their 1-10 spicy level, we got a 6 and it had a perfect amount of spice to it. Definitely don't discard the basil garnish -- mix it in with the sauce, eat it with your rice. Yum! It comes with a small pot of sticky rice, so you don't really need to order extra rice, but I'm a fan of Thai fried rice, so we got the combination too.\n\nThe Combination Fried Rice was good -- not any better than other Thai fried rices I've had. The chicken wasn't particularly moist or tender, and it only came with 2 shrimps. I would probably stick to just beef fried rice or shrimp fried rice, since the chicken didn't really add anything to the dish.\n\nThe Nam Prik Ong was what I really came here for -- I'd heard Ming Tsai raving about it on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate -- and honestly, I was underwhelmed. Not sure if they were just having an off-batch, but it wasn't as complex or flavorful as I expected it to be. I was expecting it to be spicy, with earthy flavors, herbacious Thai basil & cilantro, maybe some lime for acidity. It had a bit of heat to it, but it was pretty one-note. It reminded me more of a tomato-based chili than anything. \n\nAll in all, I can see why people flock to this place. The menu is really huge and the prices aren't too bad (considering you're in Vegas).\n\nThe strip mall it's located in is honestly really sad and run-down looking, but once you're inside, the ambiance isn't bad."

Be sure to order one.  \nI got the cod, I believe it was black cod, steamed on top of steamed cabbage with a spicy pepper sauce on the side.  This was a pretty healthy dish, fish on cabbage I skipped the rice.  He got the duck in a panang curry.  These were huge pieces of duck, easily split this entree.  The duck was seasoned well and crispy from pan frying.  The curry was very good, and medium was a good level of pepper.  They were out of the mango with sticky rice, so we split the coconut ice cream.  The ice cream tasted homemade, chunks of coconut in it.\nAn awesome restaurant!"

            "review": "Mom and I decided to give this place a try when multiple people we know recommended it as being their favorite Thai place...ever.  My true rating is about 3.5.\n\nSo we went for a leisurely lunch at around 11:40am Friday.  Business was just starting to ramp up.  We were seated at a tiny two-top...BOO...which I always hate especially when I see other parties of two sitting at 4-tops.  Not conducive to us ordering so many dishes...\n\nWe started with the papaya salad and pork larb (my must-have at any Thai place).  The dressing for the papaya salad was a little too sweet for my taste, and my fork got all sticky.  The larb was an excellent version.  Both portions were very skimpy.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered what most people on Yelp recommended - the crispy duck panang and garlic prawns.  We also got the Thai fried rice w/ beef.  The garlic prawns, I have to say, were amazing.  I expected them to be like the Chinese version, deep fried with scallions and peppers on top.  However, these were a step above...with the shell still attached and well-deep fried so you can munch on it separately from the shrimp itself.  Great flavor.\n\nI have to say that while the crispy duck panang was delicious, the dish was kind of a let-down.  When I saw crispy duck, I thought maybe it was the roasted version with crispy skin...mmm.  However, this version turned out to be breaded and deep fried.  The breading was a little thick, especially when some of the pieces were smaller and you were eating mostly breading.  Not sure if this was worth the $28 price tag.  The garlic prawn definitely was.\n\nThai fried rice was tasty but I can't say if it was better than any other version I've had.\n\nService was actually pretty good except when the servers, even when faced with the Tetris challenge of finding space on our tiny table for all our food, opted to place the dishes in awkward spots like at our elbows rather than move us to a bigger table (of which many were available).  Waters were refilled and people were generally smiley.\n\nTasty lunch with a little bit of leftovers which were delicious cold that afternoon in our hotel room!  Good version of Thai, would be a great option if you had a hankering."

Coming from San Diego and living by quite a few Chinese/Asian restaurants and having a Chinese girlfriend I expect certain things at a restaurant like this. There stuffed chicken wings were freaking amazing. I would go back for those but only those. There sticky rice was hard and dry, there garlic wings were the same. The garlic wings looked as if they had made a huge batch hours before we ordered them and they had them under a heat lamp waiting to be ordered. They tasted the way they look, dry and old. There spicy fried rice was ok, but for $13 dollars anywhere back in San Diego I would have gotten three times the amount. Definitely not worth what you pay for it. The service was also weird. Both the guy serving our food and the other guy who was walking around, looking like a manager of some sort. They just had very odd personalities and seemed a bit unsure about every thing lol."

            "review": "So this is supposedly one of the best Thai restaurants in America, eh?\n\nConsidering I live in what is probably the highest concentration of Thai restaurants in NYC, I had to check LoS out for myself.  \n\nThe result?  A 4.5.  I wouldn't say this was perfect, as I had some individual dishes elsewhere that I thought were on par or better than LoS, but some other dishes were also total standouts.  \n\nFortunately I was here with a large group, so we were able to sample a huge variety of dishes.  My impressions:\n\nAppetizers\nGolden Tofu - Nice texture and not too greasy.  Small, bite-sized portions were nice and this was definitely better than what you find in an average Thai joint (4/5)\n\nChicken Satay - Not bad, and the chicken they used was tender and not overcooked.  But there are other places that serve something comparable (3/5)\n\nNam Kao Tod - This was surprisingly my favorite dish of the night.  This appetizer had both amazing flavors and textures.  The crispy rice and sour pork were just divine.  Note, this dish is absolutely fucking spicy.  Your anus will burn later on if you don't ask them to tone down the spice up front, but it's still a tasty dish (5/5)\n\nSoups\nTom Yum Koong - Maybe it could have been spicier, but that's probably because the Nam Kao Tod blew out my senses so this didn't feel that intense.  I really liked the freshness of the shrimp with this soup. (5/5)\n\nSalads\nChicken Larb - For me this dish often is a sign of how legit a Thai place is.  For the most part I enjoyed it, though I can honestly say there are many places in NYC that I've had way better, at least for me.  (3/5)\n\nChef's Choice\nChilean Sea Bass with Suki Sauce - OMG so tasty.  Absolutely awesome fish that had a great mix of spice, crunch, tenderness and flavor.  Enuff said. (5/5)\n\nGarlic Prawns - One of their signature dishes and with good reason.  Holy shit this was my favorite dish along with the Nam Kao Tod.  It was absolutely perfect in terms of freshness, flavor, texture and balance.  You must order this (5/5).\n\nNoodles\nPad Thai - Definitely one of the more refined Pad Thai's I've had in a long time.  While it was good in terms of taste, I could have actually used even more in terms of flavor, but that's just me.  At least the texture was solid.  (4/5)\n\nPad Se Ew (pork) - I liked this WAY better than the Pad Thai.  The flavor was kick ass and if you're not careful you can literally gulp down an entire plate of this.  I can live this plate of flat noodles and some garlic shrimp and that'd be a perfect meal for me.  (5/5)\n\nDessert\nCoconut Ice Cream over Coconut Rice - My tablemates loved this.  I mean they wanted to inhale this.  I thought it was good but it didn't blow my mind.  The slightly salty texture of the rice definitely was legit compared to the desserts I ate while living in SE Asia, but I preferred the ice cream sans rice.  (3/5)\n\nAll in all, the meal was satisfying and about as memorable as it can get when you're with a loud group of friends drinking Singha beer to wash down all the spice.  The service here was nice and the vibe here with relaxed.\n\nSo is it worth schlepping your ass off the Vegas strip to visit this dinky place in the middle of a random strip mall?  If you like Thai food, the answer is definitely yes.  Is it the BEST Thai I ever had in my life?  At certain points, yes and at other points definitely no.  But it is a great holistic experience that's worth the effort if you have the time to stop by."

The restaurant itself is not all that attractive with plain walls, old kind of tacky  pictures on the white wash walls but -- understandably because the food reviews are so good -- the place is very crowded and noisy with zippo privacy. Probably not the best place to impress a date. I'll give restaurant appearance and ambience a \"C-.\"\n\nService was not any better for us than your average busy Chinese restaurant.  We had to work to get our waiters attention. He wasn't all that friendly, was not dressed as you would expect a waiter serving in such a famous place and he got our orders wrong. Worse yet all our food was brought out at one time appetizers, soup and main dishes so we could not savor any one of them which further detracted from the experience. \n\nNow for the food:\nThe crispy duck with panang curry was wonderful crisp skin flavorful sauce tender meat. \"A.\"\n\nThe crispy duck with Thai basal was equally outstanding. \"A.\"\n\nThe garlic fried prawns with seperately fried shells  were crispy light not oily but a little dry perhaps overcooked. It came out lukewarm. Garlic flavor was not in any way special and price was kind of steep. I actually would prefer a high end Japanese restaurant shrimp tempura. The dish tasted better when we put a little panang curry from the duck dish onto it. \"B.\"\n\nTom yum chicken soup ok nothing special in the flavor or prep compared to any other descent Thai restaurant. \"B.\"\n\nGreen Papaya salad with fish sauce. I hate to say this but I have this classic dish at nearly every Thai restaurant I go to and this one was quite mediocre. the texture suffered from shredding that was too coarse. The papaya was either too old or pre-shredded some time in advance which made it soggy and unacceptable. The texture also suffered from having too much sauce drowning the papaya and the flavor was not different enough from any other Thai restaurant to recommend this dish. \"C.\"\n\nThe chicken Satay was one of the dishes recommended on the Internet and it came out tender with a nice peanut sauce which was  good but not any better than any other decent Thai restaurant. \"B.\"\n\nChilean sea bass over drunken noodles with basal was very good perfectly cooked with lively flavors The only negative was the noodles were a little soggy and the size of the dish was kind of small relative to the price. \"A-.\"\n\nJackfruit relish salad with carrots cucumbers lettuce was not particularly exciting in flavor texture or presentation. I won't grade it because I cannot compare it to anything else similar I will only state that it was not  good enough  for us to order again. \n\nSticky rice with mango was good but not extraordinary. I'll give it a \"B.\"\n\nWill I come back? Probably not because the location service and ambience are below average price is quite high and food --at least the dishes we had were mediocre to good only. I will say that this place had a very large wine list but I would not want to shell out a lot of money for expensive libation for an ambience and service and food quality which was just mediocre at best."

We were lucky enough to walk into the restaurant at 6:00pm on a Friday night as a group of three with no reservations and get seated immediately.\n\nAfter perusing through over a 150 choices, I ultimately decided to start off with the Bangkok style tom kha kai and a Thai iced tea. I typically order this soup at every Thai restaurant that I attend, not only because it is a guilty pleasure of mine, but also because it serves as an excellent baseline comparison. With that being said, I was certainly disappointed with this dish. Obviously lime is a crucial element of tom kha kai, but this level of lime was excruciatingly overpowering, so much so that the lime was entirely the focus of the dish. The decision to use button mushrooms in the soup, instead of straw mushrooms also bothered me since button mushrooms are almost as substandard as shiitakes. \n\nAnyways, after finishing the tom kha kai I ignored the formation of any previous negative judgements, and ordered the chef's choice: the crispy duck with panang. The duck was placed atop the curry in a strategic effort to maintain the crispness of the skin, and it did just that. The duck was decadent, however, the panang was actually the highlight of the dish: spicy, creamy, well-balanced and delicious with both the rice and duck.\n\nUltimately, I highly recommend skipping the tom kha kai as I am sure that there are much better starters on the menu. As others have stated, please don't even bother to order the pad thai, there is seriously no excuse. Although I've notice some complaints from other Yelpers, the crispy duck with panang was worth the high price point. The dish fortunately provided a much needed redemption from the letdown of the tom kha kai. I'll certainly visit again to order more Northern dishes."

Based upon what we had it is a solid 3.5 for now. Until we return to try more items then I'll review again & hopefully I'll bump it up to 4 stars!\n\n:: TO-GO ORDER EXPERIENCE ::\n\nWe were pressed for time and had decided to do To-Go pick up on a Sunday. Restaurant doesn't open until 5:30 PM but we called ahead anyways at 5:15 PM to give it a shot. Even though we were able to place our order they do tell you kitchen does not open until 5:30 PM. \nWhen we got to the restaurant (located in a pretty run down/sketchy looking strip mall) there were already a line out the door!  \n\nEntrance to the restaurant was so TINY -- to get in you pretty much have to go in a single file line (where there is alot of people). You also have to wait in the same line even for To-Go orders! Due to the mad line we didn't pick up our To-Go order until 5:50 PM. But the gal at the front counter was very nice.  Regardless, IMO they should have a separate To-Go line or something :P\n\n:: RESTAURANT INTERIOR ::\n\nThe interior was pretty big! I couldn't even tell from the outside. Upon entrance into the establishment there is a wine cellar display and to the very right of the venue is a bar where patrons can wait for their table to be called. The atmosphere was nice and d\u00e9cor was decent. A say a bit to much celebrity photos covering the walls left & right. It's a very casual dining establishment & away from the glitz & glam of the Vegas strip. \n\n:: FOOD ::\n\nPrices here are seriously a bit steep for Thai food.  But due to the hype we tried it out anyways. For AMAZING damn good food I'll pay for it -- of course when my wallet allows it :P\n\nCRISPY DUCK W/ PANANG  $24    (4.5/5)\n-- Portion kind of small for the price. Hence the minus 0.5 star. Duck was definitely crispy & there were no bones! The panang curry was delicious! But i wished they gave more tho :P \n\nSUA RONG HAI   $18   (3.5/5)\n-- Aka the \"Crying Tiger.\" Generous charbroiled beef portion but something about the charbroiled taste of the beef was a little off/different or maybe this is the true taste of a Crying Tiger? The home-made spicy sauce was not so bad but not much tang to it. \n\nCRAB FRIED RICE   $14   (2.5/5)\n-- There really were HARDLY any crab pieces in this fried rice. Tasted like regular fried rice. Definitely not worth the price. You're probs better off with the regular Thai fried rice for cheaper.\n\nTHAI ICED COFFEE   $2.50   (3/5)\n-- My taste bud didn't quite love it but found it not bad... something was lacking. Maybe it's just me?!"

I had appetizer, salad, main course and dessert. So why the incomplete?\n\nWell, with over 150 items (I can't remember the full count) there's a lot to try. With this first visit, we decided to go Thai lite. But not to worry dear Yelpers, I have more visits planned. Luckily, my sister teaches at the high school just down the street so I'll always have an excuse. \n\nSo enough with the pleasantries. Time for the food goodness. To start, we had fried chicken dumplings. It was good though not entirely memorable. I liked eating it but I don't have to have it on my next visit. \n\nAlso up for starters is the traditional Thai salad with peanut dressing. I don't need to say much about this except that my brother in law was slurping up the dressing and kept the bowl of dressing on the table after the salad greens were removed. (He later poured some on his steamed rice. Don't ask.)\n\nFor the main dishes, we went with pad Thai (good), sua rong hai (yummy grilled beef with a nice spicy sauce) and panang curry with chicken (my favorite out of the three). \n\nFor dessert we had a rice pudding and fried banana roll. Both if these are very good. I especially enjoyed the banana roll with coconut sugar(?) wrapped in fried crispy wonton goodness. I could've eaten just the innards (good by their lonesome) if I wanted to save a few calories. But why bother living at all? So just shove it all in your mouth and swallow, calories be dammed. (Get your minds out of the gutter, but the double entendre is understandably apropos.) \n\nSo nothing mind-blowingly exciting but good solid eating. I spent a lot of time looking at other tables' orders like the whole fried fish or battered shrimp that caught my eye. Yes, I had prawn envy. \n\nBut I vow to return and try all the other goodies. If my first tastes are good enough to go back before the check has even arrived, then you know me likey. \n\nNext time you're in Vegas, stop by and get some prawns. I will be."

This was the only true northern dish but it was the BEST dish ever!\n* Nam Kao Tod - Crispy rice mixed with pork, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, and lime juice. Normally with crushed peanuts but since I'm not a fan of nuts, I had them make it without.\n* Papaya salad - green papaya, chili, tomato,mixed with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar.

Tasty!\n\nIt's impossible for me to enjoy super spicy Thai food but I don't mind a small taste of it. Everything was ordered mild if possible.\n\nPlan on trying something different. Go beyond the usual and please don't order the pad Thai. It might be good but after looking around, I noticed that there are so many other outstanding dishes.  Don't let the strip mall location deter you from visiting either. The food is fresh and it's huge inside.

We ordered what all yelpers suggest- Northern Thai food:\n\n1. Khao Soi- best dish of the night. The curry base was delicious- not overpowering. very creamy. I've had better khao soi in LA. \n\n2. Northern larb (I didn't try it but it was well received by the others in our group).\n\n3. Kang Ka Noon (spicy jack fruit curry with chicken)- Just ok. They warned us this dish is more of a soup, and it is. It is difficult to finish this dish without a spoon. The dish isn't spicy as advertised- maybe they tone it down intentionally? Either way, this dish, to me, was like a thin tomato soup with jack fruit. Not worth the $$.\n\n4. Nam Prik Ong (red chili dip)- is described as being the least spicy, and it's true. No spice as all. It is, however, a nice dip for the veggies, but it is way too much ($10.95) for what is basically a side dish. \n\n5. Drunken Noodle Prawns- the famous deep fried prawns with drunken noodles. Yes, they are good, but not amazingly good. Definitely crunchy, juicy and flavorful, but I've had much better fried prawns at other restaurants, and definitely cheaper. There were probably three prawns in the dish and about 6 pieces of just the shell. And $25.95 for essentially three prawns is a rip off. Also-- there was probably two drunken noodles on the plate. \n\n6. Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab- More drunken noodles than crab. However, if you like your noodles very slippery and gummy, get the drunken noodles. This was the spiciest of our dishes and to me the tastiest. They cooked the crabs well, but no claw meat- mostly the smaller legs. I've had soft shell crab at other restaurants in LA that was much more generous with their crab. \n\nOverall, the food was OK, but I can't justify waiting for hours to eat here. The portion sizes are small. No, I'm not talking small compared to American sized portions-- they are small compared to what I had in Northern Thailand. You can get much better food at other restaurants with less of a wait and for less $$. Don't buy into the hype!"

You would think that it would just be the best Thai food you will ever eat outside of Thailand (which I haven't had the pleasure of visiting, yet)?\n\nI have a feeling it's because there aren't much options for Thai cuisine in the neighborhood that they give this place such distinction. I've had better Thai food in Los Angeles (Thai Town) and there is no shortage of Thai restaurants in LA.\n\nOverall, I am sad that it did not live up to the hype.

Portions are unfortunately not that big and it is not cheap, especially for a Thai restaurant, but oh man the taste!"

Bang helped him out and picked out a couple great wines.  The red curry is probably the best red curry that I have ever had.  The appetizers; chicken sa-tay, garlic and pepper chicken wings, won tons and egg rolls (best egg rolls also, finally a place that has traditional egg rolls), were extraordinary!  We also had sweet and sour pork and Prik king.  Both were okay but still good.  My suggestion is to get tons of appetizers and order tons of red curry!  Make a reservation because they are always busy and I mean always busy!  The service for an asian restaurant is great, we weren't sitting there waiting for anything and they were all very nice and attentive to our needs.  They have expanded so they are able to accommodate large parties and they have a small bar.  It's worth the taxi ride over!"

Make sure to eat every part of the shrimp, shell and all. The shell is crispy like a chip and has tons of flavor. There was one shrimp left, with the shell mostly separated from the meat. I told my friend to take the meat and I ate the shell. When you prefer the shell to the meat, it must be good. The crispy duck over noodles was cooked perfectly. The pad see ew was one of the best I've had, and the mango & sticky rice was the best way to top off the meal. If you have the chance to venture away from the strip a little, come here. They are famous for their northern Thai cuisine so make sure to order a couple of dishes from the back of the menu. Make sure to make reservations. There is a steady stream of people coming in and gets crowded fast. I got there at 7pm on a Sunday, and the place was still crowded when I left after 9pm."

            "review": "Recently returned here again when in town, since my girl always tells me that it's hard to find good Thai food. I've proven her wrong with a duck curry in the Sacramento area (of all places) and had little doubt she would love this place. We tried calling to make reservations, because there was a wait even with reservations the last time I came. But nobody answered the phone, so we just decided to go and stick it out if it wasn't too long. My girl put her name on the list and was told ten to fifteen minutes, but it ended up being closer to thirty. Expected and not a big deal. \n\nWith all that time in the lobby waiting, I was able to read some random articles on the walls and one food review, although older, mentioned several dishes that sounded quite interesting. When it came time to order, I decided to go with some of the items that were recommended in that article. \n\nWe are both soup addicts and instead of going with the safe choices I've always gone with at Thai restaurants (Tom Yum and Tom Kha), I suggested we try the En Tuan. It's a spicy and sour beef tendon soup. We requested it at 8/10 spice and my girl thought it packed a little too much heat, but I absolutely loved it. The fragrance from the broth is mesmerizing and the consistency of the soup is great. Not too thick or thin. Generous amounts of beef slices and topped off with some green onions and cilantro that add a nice, fresh contrast. A bowl will only set you back $8.95 and that is more than enough for two people to share. Highly recommend!\n\nAnother dish that was raved about in that article was the Issan Sausage. Two sausages sliced in bite size pieces (a little larger than bite size actually) that comes on a plate with peanuts, chili, ginger and lettuce. We weren't sure how to attack this dish, but when we asked our waiter, he informed us that there is no way correct way to eat this. The sausages are described as \"sour\", but I didn't really feel that. There was a bit of tartness and the flavor was definitely unique and much different than other sausages I've had. The outer layer had that good sausage snap and the inside was juicy and delicious. \n\nFor our entree, it was an easy decision as we both love duck curry. They have a roasted duck curry priced around $13 under the Curries section of the menu, but do yourself a favor and pay the $23.95 for the crispy duck in Panang curry. We also ordered this at an 8/10 spice level, and this time, it was beyond scorching for me while my girl was slurping up the curry sauce like it was nothing. The flavor in this dish is out of this world. The crispiness and quality of the duck was just as good as the last time I had it. \n\nThe only downside to this place is the parking lot (the beggars will find and chase you down) and its location (guess shootings and murders are the norm around here, as I learned from two different locals), but forget all that and just go inside and enjoy some really fantastic Thai food!"

I haven't been able to make it back in town for leisure but I finally ended up back in town for business the week of SEMA 2009 (Nov 1-8).\n\nAfter a bit of convincing, we took an entire business dinner here with over 20 people.  Even though we were strange foreigners to the area, we all managed to find it in the dark parking lot of horrors that lured us in away from the shiny flashy neon lights of Vegas. Our dinner party consisted of foodies and hungry men from CA, OK, and Taiwan, and China.\n\nThe menu had what seems like hundreds of various options that I've never even seen on a Thai menu.  Normally I'd just expect Pad Thai, Rad Naa, Pad See Ew and some seafood fried rice, but the menu here was so vast and covered everything from Chilean Sea Bass, to short ribs, beef salads, curries, rices, fried Prawns and the traditional Pad Thai. The 23 of us managed to order almost 30 dishes and we all had the intention of eating individually but we ended up eating family style because we all reacted with the same \"OMG, you MUST try this, it's too good!\" reactions.\n\nThere were soo many dishes ordered that I'm not even going to waste my time trying to list everything out.  Personally, I ordered the Sea Bass w/ Suki sauce and I also managed to try the traditional curries w/ rice, and noodles.  I also bummed someone's beef short ribs and a wonderful sampling of Tom Yum soup.  Seriously, the food was so amazing that we all just shared and the \"business meeting\" ended up turning into a friendly feast.\n\nThe experience was so amazing that I brought a 2nd business dinner there two nights later.  The same exact thing happened as the first too! We ened up eating like a hungry family and no one left unhappy.\n\nSeriously, this is beyond me saying \"some of the best Thai food I've ever had\".  It actually is more like \"some of the best food I've ever had PERIOD\".  Not only is the food here so amazing that it's worth sharing, it's brought some of my most memorable and happiest dining experiences as a group.  \n\nI still get calls from the clients in Oklahoma and reps from Taiwan who say they want to go back. \n\nYes. It's that darn good.  \n\nThank you Lotus of Siam (and Penny) for making us fiend real and amazing Thai food.  \n\nI will forever walk singing your praises...\n\n\"It's so yummy, in my tummy, omm nomm nommm nom!\""

(Note: See my previous post about the Bellagio Buffet) Oh, and they wanted someplace off the strip thats not a chain restaurant. Oh boy. Fun!\n\nI log onto Yelp to check out some options. Immediately I see my HUGE A$$ Pancake picture and suggest Hash House A Go Go. Its pretty tasty there. I was then told that someone in the group didnt want to see humongous portions anymore. Huh? What? Really? I dont think I've ever heard that before.\n\nSo I go on searching for the perfect place and there it was... Staring blatantly at me right smack dab on the front page. No other than the Review of the Day! The place? Lotus of Siam! Voted the Best Thai food in America by Gourmet Magazine has to mean something... right?\n\nI jump on my cell and immediately call the restaurant. I know they are always packed and require a day in advance reservations. The nice gentleman on the phone tells me that they are allowing walk ins tonight and its a first come first served basis. I figure for a Wednesday night, it cant be that busy.... Can it? \n\nMy friends leave from the Venetian and I leave from my house. I get a call about 10 minutes later.\n\n\"Leo, are you sure its Lotus of Siam?\"\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\"Its not in the nicest of areas. Its in a strip mall and its surrounded by \"massage parlors\" and such. Is it really that good?\"\n\nFeeling like they were in an episode of Punk'd, I assured them that the food is outstanding. I also jokingly told them not to leave any valuables in the car and to keep a close eye on their purse/pockets. Of course you know there's always a little truth in every joke.\n\nSo I pull up around 7:30 and notice a few parties waiting outside the door. I see my friends and they said we're 4th on the list. Not to bad I guess. We wait a good 30 minutes and finally get seated. A couple that had been waiting there before us snickered at us since we got seated before them. I guess I would feel the same way too after smelling all that yummy food.\n\nLets get to the important stuff. THE FOOD!\n\nGARLIC CHICKEN WINGS. Oh my God. This is delicious. Light crispy skin with honey garlic spicy sauce. Wow. This dish was good. You get about 7-8 wings per order.\n\nNAM KAO TOD - The crispy rice and sour sausage dish was very very tasty. Lots of flavors attacking the pallet at the same time. We got a medium spicy and we felt it. The spiciness was gradually getting hotter and hotter with each bite. If you only took one bite, you'd be fine. But seriously, how can you stop after only one bite?\n\nTOM YUM KUNG - Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass, and straw mushroom. Tasty but I dont think I would order this again with so many other soup choices on the menu.\n\nGARLIC PRAWN - Amazing. The skin was soooo crispy, you could eat the prawn whole with skin and everything. One friend kept on eating just the skin! The prawns were huge. Normally, the medium size shrimp go about 40/45 pieces per pound. I bet these would be like 20 pieces a pound.\n\nCRISPY DUCK with PANANG - I think this was the best dish of the night. Wow. The duck skin was definitely crispy. There were good chunks of meat under the skin as well. Definitely more than I expected. And that alone is mouth watering, but then add the Panang (Curry) and it was perfect. I would definitely without a doubt order this again.\n\nSEA BASS OVER DRUNKEN NOODLES - The sea bass filets were seared just right and the thick (chow fun) noodles underneath were scrumptious as well. I was delightfully surprised about the large serving size.\n\nAll this food with some Thai Iced Teas and we were happy campers. Needless to say, I redeemed myself with a good pick and the party definitely had a good meal. This morning when I arrived at work, I found myself telling all my coworkers about Lotus of Siam and how AWESOME the food is. I guess I really liked it. Anyone coming to Vegas has to check this place out. And most importantly... DONT FORGET TO INVITE ME!\n\nI hear the lunch buffet is not very good. Definitely go for dinner... and make reservations!"

Pretend this doesn't exist.\n\n#2, there's a normal Thai menu with stuff like phad thai and panang curry.  While this stuff is good, it's not unlike what you might eat at a good Thai restaurant in Seattle or San Francisco or New York.\n\n#3, there's a section of the menu with Northern Thai dishes and Chef's Special dishes.  This is the heart of the menu and what makes foodies cry with delight.  If you're coming all the way here (and it's a long walk from the middle of the strip), you must order off of these sections of the menu.\n\nWe've been here several times.  Most recently, we had the dry sausage, a green curry dip, and finally the special Beef Stew with peppercorn sauce (option A I think.)\n\nWhile all of these are highly recommended, the beef stew was one of the most delicious things I've ever had.  The meat was absolutely fork tender, flavored with aromatic and perfectly balanced Thai spices--the right mix of sweet and spicy and pungent.  Just amazing.  Totally beyond the flavors and textures you expect.\n\nThey grow a lot of their own herbs and spices because they're not available outside of Thailand.  As a result, you'll taste flavors and combinations you've probably not had before.\n\nAgain, order off of the Northern Thai or Chef's menus.  And prepare to be amazed."

            "review": "I don't understand where all the 4 to 5 stars are basing their taste buds on. When I first walked in, I could smell the musky coach roach scent in the air. I have the nose of a K9. Then the man who showed me to the table was rude. Maybe because I am also Asian and he thought I not worthy. He showed me the table and stopped me in mid stride as I was walking to it so that he could walk there first. Utterly ridiculous. \n\nI always ordered my Pad Thai with less sweet because most places dump a bucket load of sugar into this dish. No exception here. I specifically asked for less sugar but it came out a lot sweeter than I had asked. I just don't get it. Most other dishes I ordered are too sweet for my preference.\n\nWhen we were done and the waiter was not around, I went up to the cashier to pay. The young cashier girl told me to go back because apparently only the waiter could give me my check. House rules? Are they trying to run it like a 5 stars restaurant when the  smell of roaches waft in the air and foods are subpar at best? To add insult to injury, they tagged on 18% gratuity. Gratuity should never be mandatory. If they want to make it mandatory at the very least, treat their customers better. Needless to say, this is my first and last visit. If there's a zero star or less, I would give it that.\n\nI'm from LA where even the mid tier Thai restaurants are head and shoulders above this place. Pass this place if you're thinking of Thai food. You deserve better foods and better service."

            "review": "There is a part of me that feels sad writing this review.  Why?  Because I used to love this place so much.  It had been a while since I was last here and I was really looking forward to a great LOS experience.  Several years ago, I ate here so often and brought in so many people that the staff even gave me a free shirt.\n\nAlas, those glory days are over.  Their portion sizes have shrunk, the prices have gone up, and the service leaves something to be desired.  \n\nI arrived early for dinner to beat the wait and when my party of 4 was seated, they only gave us 2 menus and no wine list.  After a little while, the server came over to take our drink order.  When we let him know that we wanted to order wine, but we still weren't offered a wine list.  I decided not to push the issue and went with just a glass of his choosing instead of a bottle and then placed our dinner order.\n\nOur appetizer was stuffed chicken wings.  2 chicken wings for $11.   They're good chicken wings, but not $11 good.  With a party of 4 people, I'm surprised our server didn't advise us that there would only be two.  Try putting 4 on the plate and then the pricing might make sense.  \n\nThe combination beef noodle soup was very good. I'll admit - I'm an Asian soup noodle guy.  Love the pho, wonton soup, beef stew, and ramen.  This is a nice dish that holds its own with the greats.  Beef, meatballs, noodles, fragrant broth, and garnished with fried pork skin.  Good portion at a very reasonable price.  \n\nOur Pad Thai tasted great, but the portion size was about half of what I remember them serving in the past.  Since we were all sharing dishes, it wasn't a huge deal, but it would take at least 2 of these orders to equal what you would get at most other Thai restaurants in town.     \n\nThe whole Thai BBQ chicken was meh.  Seasoning was okay, but I'm guessing it had been left over from lunch (or earlier), as it came out of the kitchen at room temperature only 3-4 minutes after ordering it together with the duck (and before our appetizer).  It had that \"stale chicken\" texture that old supermarket rotisserie chicken has towards the end of the night when it's sat under the heat lamps for too many hours and becomes mealy.  Although it's cut into pieces, the chicken is somewhat small.  Not humanely raised tasty farm chicken small though.  The parts look like they came from a 22-24oz Cornish game hen.\n\nMy biggest disappointment of the evening came to the table in the form of panang crispy duck.  This used to be my favorite dish and I was really looking forward to it.  When the entree came out, it was a fraction of the size of its former self.  The duck was not fried to order and the panang did not have the same richness and depth that it used to.  Was it horrible?  No.  Would I order it again?  Absolutely not.  I asked the server about the portion size of not only this dish, but the rest of them as well and he replied that they all appeared to be fine.  I asked why the duck portion had shrunk so much and he informed me that the portion was only supposed to be 1/4 of a duck.  He said that he hadn't worked there very long but it's been that way as long as he'd worked there.  1/4 of a duck with totally unremarkable panang for $25?  Yikes!  It used to be a whole roasted duck, butterflied, de-boned, and then flash fried to order for that price.\n\nThe verdict?  Completely average food, small portions, and big prices.  From now on, I'll be heading over to Spring Mt to get my Thai food fix when I'm in Las Vegas.  I have to wonder what sort of horrible Thai food that the other reviewers on here are eating which causes them to give LOS 5 stars?  Oh, how I yearn for the days when LOS was a small hole in the wall and there was still a wig shop next door.\n\nThe good news out of all of this?  The gay bar at the entrance of the Commercial Center called Spotlight (which has always been and is still very straight friendly) received a full remodel inside and out recently.  Service is fantastic and well drinks and beer are still 2 for $4 during happy hour.  So, if your heart's set on overhyped mediocre Thai food, you can still grab a drink next door while waiting for your table."

We had the drunken noodles with assorted seafood as that's what yelpers appear to be having. We also had that peanut sauce beef (beef rama) and fish cakes. All were good. The fish cakes were interesting... little better than normal but had a lot of chilis... probably the most underwhelming of all the dishes...

Why not put it all on the same line? \n\nNeedles to say if you want to go here then go. I looked forward to it for months after we booked our trip to Vegas. I was honestly let down but you could say that with anything your hype up and look forward to for months. You can find better restaurants in other areas of Vegas.

I love the fact that I travel a decent amount for work, so I get to try a lot of new places and write reviews. Ironically, it's because of that travel that I haven't been able to write any reviews lately. I've had so many jam-packed 1-day travels that, I might check in to a hotel on Yelp, but I'll knock out about 20 seconds after, then wake up, shower, and leave - all while still kinda sleeping. Even meals have been rushed. The business dinners might be in nice restaurants, but we're having such fierce conversations about work, that the food might as well have just teleported into our stomachs without ever being tasted.\n\nOK, now that that's out of the way, a little history. Pad Thai used to be what I thought Thai food was. Yes, I know that it IS Thai food, but I mean I thought that was all Thai food was! In 2007, I had Lotus of Siam and we ordered all sort of things and it was amazing. Since then, I discovered more facets of Thai food, namely Tom Kha and Penang Curry. Ever since I tried those, I've been dying to try them at Lotus, because this is touted by some as the best Thai restaurant on the planet!\n\nTOM KHA KAI\nServer asked how spicy I wanted it, and then said \"on a scale of 1-10.\" I was taken aback, because that's a really wide range! Even though I normally order \"Extra Spicy\" at other Thai places, the numbers intimidated me a bit, so I just said 8.\n\nIt tasted fine, but it didn't have anything in there that would make it taste great. No landmines, so that's good. The chicken was seasoned enough, but dry. The Tom Kha (and maybe this is just the style) was missing the tiny bit of sweetness that I've come to like and expect. As for spice, the first spoonful, I thought I got duped, but then after about 3 more spoons, the heat started to rise! Not enough for me to grab water, but enough where taking bites of the hot garlic prawns were painful on the tongue. It really seemed like that if you just had the soup, the 8 would actually be like a 6, but I think the higher the number, the more pepper bits are in the soup, so you just have a higher chance of picking one up, and those peppers themselves pack a punch!\n\nPENANG CURRY\nSigh. It's missing that almost nutty flavor that I've come to like, and it was a little too ginger-y/lemongrassy than I like. Consistency was about as much as condensed milk, and a spice level of 8, tasted more like a 4. The beef didn't really lend any helpful flavors, but hey, at least it was protein! Not the worst I've ever had, but I'm just really disappointed, considering how many people have this as their favorite Thai restaurant. Then again, it could just be different styles, which I admittedly don't know much about.\n\nGARLIC PRAWNS\nI remember when I was little, a friend of mine used to eat the shrimp tail. I was mesmerized! I had never even tried it before. So, I fearlessly started trying to eat the tail, and I was almost to the point of gagging. Fast forward 25 years and here I am at Lotus of Siam. \n\nThe shrimp comes out looking like the letter w. The left \"u\" is the shrimp, the right \"u\" is the shell of the shrimp, both still connected at the tail. The whole thing has been seasoned and deep fried. Now, I've had Japanese sweet shrimp before, where they fry the heads, and it was better than eating that shrimp tail many years ago, but I couldn't eat more than 1. These were definitely better, but it took a lot of mental psyching and determination to eat several. \n\nThe shrimp is good. The shell is actually pretty tasty. Out of all the fried shrimp shell I've had, this was the best. It was more crunchy/crispy than any other one I've had by far. And it had a buttery flavor to it that helped take my mind off of the shell. For me, if I took a bite of shrimp and a bite of shell, that was a tumultuous bite, and I had to fight the urge to spit it out. The trick was to eat the shell by itself, like it was one big shrimp chip. The other thing was to keep my mouth dry. Once I took the bite, I had to keep saliva away (sorry to get so technical here) and definitely resist the urge to \"wash it down.\" When the shell was dry and crispy, it shattered easier, which meant that it ground down finely so it was easy to swallow...like a chip. As soon as moisture was introduced, the shell no longer wanted to shatter, instead it would just flex, which meant that when you swallowed, it was that rough shell-like texture that made me want to gag. \n\nSo all in all, happy I tried it, but perfectly fine with never trying it again.\n\nLOTUS OF DISAPPOINTMENT\nI can't tell you how disappointed I was with the curry and soup. I've been waiting at least 4 years to have an opportunity to come to Vegas to try these dishes, and it didn't deliver. It's not to say this place isn't good.

I can't wait to go back and try some new dishes. I got the Tom Yum Goon at a 7 spiciness level. I'm pretty good with spicy food, but this was just a little over my threshold for enjoyment. There was a some minor panic and coughing but it subsided after about 10 minutes. I should have started a little lower level and worked up. It's all about your preference, of course. \n\nFor entrees we split the steak salad and the house special fried rice. They both offered a range of flavor and their own nuances. I would order them both again. I can't wait to go back and delve into some curry, noodles, and specialty items. \n\nWe didn't have to wait as we got there at 11:30 on a holiday. I've heard it gets really crowded, so plan ahead! I can't wait to go back."

            "review": "My second time here. We ordered the basil and chili with sliced beef, spicy number 7, pad Thai with chicken, spicy level number 7, and musaman curry with chicken, spicy level 5. It is worth noting that the basil and chilli with sliced beef is exceptional. Reminds me of this wonderful restaurant called Tara Thai in Manhattan Beach, CA, when it was still owned and by Penn, who also was the cook. \n\nWe arrived for lunch on a Friday at 1:30. Many of the tables were occupied, and because it is the number 1 rated restaurant in Las Vegas according to Yelp and Trip Advisor, I was happy to get a table right away. The server took the order after about 10 minutes which was fine since we were talking anyway. The portions are downright dainty. The pad Thai was burnt, and when we requested another plate that wasn't burnt, it was almost the same. \n\nBottom line is that the pad Thai was downright awful, and the musaman curry was nothing exceptional. I felt incredibly full after sharing these 3 small entrees with someone. Shortly after leaving I felt incredibly bloated, achy, and like I took laughing gas. Called the restaurant to ask if they used MSG and they said they put it in every dish! 2 hours later my muscles ache, I feel sick and this top rated restaurant pretty much msg poisoned me. \n\nBottom line, you can get better Thai food at Krung Thai on Flamingo and Decatur, which doesn't use msg and is about half the price. Don't believe the hype."

The menu descriptions were far more exciting than the actual product - bland, with not very many ingredients (e.g. a dish that promised pineapple had literally 2 pieces of pineapple in it).\n\nI have faith in their potential, though, so I wish I could give this place another go."

We tried the sticky rice, the Pad Thai with tofu, the Khao Soi braised short ribs, the Issan Nua Dad Deaw beef jerky, and the Mussaman Curry with beef (pardon any misspellings, going by memory here).  The server assisted us with choosing some very delicious and unexpected wine pairings.  Very good and worth the wait.  We went on a Wednesday night around 7PM and while we were unable to make reservations earlier that day, we were seated in about a half hour (kind of risky considering the trouble one must go through to get there--but isn't that what Vegas lives by, afterall?).    \n\nWhat I didn't like:  being asked to leave when we were only there for maybe ten minutes after finishing/still picking at our food (the people who were next to us, also a party of three must have loitered around for a good 45 minutes, which is inconsistent, hence the annoyance)--yeah, you wait a half hour to eat, then you get to sit for a moment and digest your food afterward, right?  I dislike how one has to taxi everywhere in this town and frankly you'd better bring a few friends to chip-in on the $40 RT cab ride to and from your hotel, but the food is pretty amazing and hopefully your work is paying for it all anyway.  I was disappointed that we missed out on any hint of spice (a Scandinavian-bred/fed toddler could have easily palated any number of the dishes we ordered, contrary to their warnings).  \n\nRegardless, this is a very good place, worth the hype and a real breath of fresh air amidst the craziness of Vegas."

They had our table at the 45m mark just like they promised which was surprising. \n\nI had high expectations given their reputation, recent spotlight on Top Chef Masters, and lots of high Yelp reviews. I have to say, I've had way better. \n\n\nPros: \n\n-The place is way bigger than it looks from the door.\n-They let you wait at the bar (but you can't order food there).\n-They have the largest wine list I've ever seen at any Asian restaurant.\n-They have an entire page devoted to Riesling by the glass.\n-Their Thai tea is good, and I don't even like Thai iced tea.\n-Their infamous garlic shrimp dish is super flavorful, sweet, and salty.\n-Crab fried rice was decent but not a revelation. Super greasy.\n-Pad thai tasted good and was cooked al dente. Small portion but good ratio of noodles to proteins.\n-Service was relatively friendly.\n\n-Cons:\n\n-High prices. Small portions. \n-Pretty decent flavors in most dishes except for the tom yum koong which was just all lime and chili with very faint lime leaf taste and no real garlic, sugar, nor lemongrass flavors. They also use white mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms like advertised. I was so bummed since white mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms in this soup is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to Thai food. Ugh. -They also say that all dishes come with white rice, but there was barely enough for 2ppl (we had a party of 4 and were forced to eat like rice was a scarcity). When I asked for just one small additional scoop, they charged for it. Wth?!\n\n\nBeer wine sake only. Large parking lot. Plaza seems sketchy. The meal wasn't bad. It was just disappointing after all of the hype and also in comparison to places I've tried in SoCal & NY."

Of course, getting there was a little difficult because it doesn't face the main street so there won't be any signs for it. You pretty much turn on a small street the directly connects to the plaza that Lotus of Siam is in. It doesn't look crackin' on the outside, due to the large unused lot, but once you step inside the venue, you'll see that the place usually has a full house around 7-9 PM. \n\nFirst of all, a must order is the Nam-Prik-Ong (Red Chili Dip under their Northern Thai Cuisine). It is a burst of flavor in every bite. The dip contains ground pork with various spices, and is eaten with sticky rice or fresh vegetables. After hearing about this dish from the all-famous, next Iron Chef Ming Tsai, I had to come to this place on one of my frequented trips to Las Vegas. And I have not stopped thinking about this dish since. Too bad its only an appetizer because I would definitely eat it as an entree if I could. \n\nWe also had the Plar Koong, Nua Dad Deaw, Moo Yang, Tom Yum Kai, and various other dishes (went with a party of 8 hungry hungry hippos - JK, I love you guys). All of those dishes were great!! Just one warning though, if you get the soup and they ask you for what level of spicy-ness (1-10), don't say 7 unless you want to get your mouth seriously burned and engorged with capsaicin. That was the most spicy dish I've ever had. I bet the soup would have tasted lovely if it wasn't over powered by all that spice. But anyways, their food was still top notch for Las Vegas."

Every card-carrying foodie from San Diego to Buffalo knows the lore of the Thai restaurant with the chef who catered to a king, or something like that. Cab rides to this Commercial Center restaurant are probably second only to cab rides to [insert most popular strip club]. (Despite my name, I don't know the strip circuit scene.)\n\nThere is a lot of hype, which perhaps make it easy to disappoint, but at the same time it is an off-the-beaten-path hole-in-the-wall, which makes it easy for folks to think they have discovered Mecca. I had waited to write a review because I had only been there once four years ago, and I felt that I needed to give LOS another try. The first time I went I strayed from my usual Thai curries and ordered some Northern Thai specialties. I was disappointed. I thought it was overpriced and undergood.\n\nLast night, I went back for a second tasting, and I ordered curries. The red and massaman curries were good, solid Thai, but the portions were a bit small, and the vegetable selection included baby corn-- a pet peeve. Plus, they do not have one single grain of brown rice. \n\nThey underwent a mysterious renovation, which somehow involved more tan paint and a wall in the middle of the dining area, but that is just a side note.\n\nI am really torn because I find it hard to contradict years of sentiment and foodie dogma, and I am thinking that perhaps the true gems of LOS are specialty items that I have yet to order. When it comes to Thai, I am so happy with my curries and rice, I never want a specialty item, so for me, it would not be worth a 45-minute wait or an expensive cab ride, but the other day when we were dining next door, we met a man from NY who has the food Fed Ex'd to his house, so there has to be something there. \n\nIn the meantime, I'll be noshing on brown rice at Thai Noodle."

Lots of Korean restaurants, a saloon, travel agency, billiards and karaoke. \n\nAnyway, this place is supposed to be pretty famous I guess...saw lots of celeb pics on wall and voted best Thai food in America or something. I had the lunch buffet which was only $8.99. Not a bad deal for unlimited pad thai, chicken curry, eggrolls, sauteed veggies, couple different soups, fruits, etc, etc. Honestly though, I wouldn't call it the best Thai food I've had. I think L.A. has a lot of good places already. I'm spoiled with all the great restaurants in L.A. But ya know...the service was pleasant here and it was kinda nice eating at a restaurant off the strip...away from all the chaos. Maybe I'll try something on the regular menu next time."

I also remember her house had various Buddhas, Thai figurines, elephants, and a picture of the Thai king and queen adorning her home. Going to Lotus of Siam is like going back to my grandmas house except they charge me and I have to share this place with other people. It's in a sketchy strip mall, it's insanely busy ALL the time, but I'd brave it all to come and eat here. The food is authentic (seriously my grandma would cook this stuff, I didn't know that Pad Thai was \"Thai\" food until much later in life) and I can't imagine a place that does some of these staples anywhere else. If you come for lunch you have the option of doing the buffet. DO NOT DO THE BUFFET. You may as well just hit up Buffet Asia. Don't go to any restaurant that has a James Beard Award and even think about the buffet. \nI've been here so many times that I can't list all the dishes I've had. NONE of them disappoint. If you're nervous or unfamiliar with Thai food ask your server for some recommendations. If you're familiar with Thai food, but not so familiar with Northern Thai food order a few familiar items and get at least ONE thing you've never had before. There's a reason it's busy,there's a reason it's won awards, there's a reason I feel a real sense of nostalgia for grandma's house when I'm here, and there's a reason my mom (also from Thailand) has trouble eating Thai anywhere else. This place is good because they showcase authentic Thai cuisine and they try to honor the culture via taste buds. If you want to go, but hate waiting (I feel you man) visit at lunch when they first open and make a reservation."

They are closed from 2:30p-5:29p, and reopen for dinner at 5:30p-10:00p (I learned this the hard way because I was actually craving their food today and went at 2:45 only to find out they were closed... wahh! My excitedness got the best of me because I didn't even bother checking their hours. WOMP WOMP WOMPPP!)\n\nWHAT: Prior to coming here for the first time (Yesterday, December 9th), I have always passed by, heard from other people, and have actually seen them on TV! Thankfully one of my best friends has been wanting to come here, so we made it a Date!\n\nWe came for dinner (I heard they have a buffet for lunch *wink wink*), and waited about 15 minutes to get seated. The restaurant was pretty huge for what I thought it would be, and it was definitely ON AND POPPIN' because every single table was taken.\n\nWhen we were seated, our server helped us to a glass of water right away, and constantly checked if we were doing okay. My friend and I finally got to ordering:\n\nWe both got cups of soup, which I love, because not a lot of thai places offer cups of soup! =D (Or at least the ones that I have gone to). My favorite soup ever is Tom Kah Kai (because of the coconut milk added). My friend got a tamarind base soup, which was remarkably soothing on a cold winter night.\n\nFor our main dishes, we both got curries. I tried the Musaman curry with veggies and tofu, which was extremely tasteful, my friend got the Green curry with a kick of spice- really good as well!\n\nThere were so many other things I wanted to try on their menu, but I think my eyeballs were playing tricks on me because I for sure wouldn't have finished it all!\n\nSo... GO, GO, GO! I'll probably be back in a few days because I want to try their CRISPY DUCK. MUAHAHA!\n\nGOOD LUCK, GET THE CRISPY DUCK! =)"

As you walk in it looks like a normal restaurant, except I noticed a bunch of James Beard Awards on the wall...okay getting better. The menu was extensive. They had every thai food you could think of and then some more. Well instead of us searching, contemplating, arguing and then making up about the menu, we asked our server (that was the advice people kept givving us). \n\nSure enough, the server recommended item after item, and instead of getting just one thing per person we went family style and shared everything. It was a celebration of Thai food. The curried lamb and chicken were amazing. The noodles and tofu were just right. Everything was spot on and on point. I now see why they received all of those James Beard Awards. We also imbibed on some Thai Beer \"Singha\", they have a large or a small...i would go for the large.

The inside of the restaurant looks nothing like the outside.  If you're mapping your way to this restaurant, and find yourself sightly nervous because of the inadequate area lighting, you're in the right place.  The restaurant does a good job at sprucing up the atmosphere with white table cloths, and an impressive wine list & glassware.  The food is very authentic and stays true to its Thai flavors and textures.  The restaurant is very busy, I recommend making reservations."

Pad thai wasn't your typical ketchupy tasting fast food pad thai but the portions were so small it was a joke. Same with the papaya salad and most of the people eating there were white. Think about that for a second. I'm not saying white folk don't know their Asian food but an Asian restaurant with no Asians eating there tells you something. Food was slow to come out but service was good. They kept coming back and checking on the table. Maybe one too many times in fact but I guess it's better than bad/no service. If you are looking to try the place because it was on tv by all means. Not a whole lot of value for your buck though. You can basically get just as good or better somewhere else. The difference if there is any is marginal at best."

Be ready to wait up to an hour during regular dining time (6:30-8:30), but don't worry, once the food gets in your mouth you'll totally understand why so many covet this place. This is probably the best thai food I have ever had! It is no wonder why they have so many Zagat awards!The decor is whatever, but honestly I would eat in a card board box as long as they would serve me. \nWe ordered the crispy duck panang, the seafood drunken noodle and the thai barbeque chicken. Delicious! Everything was amazingly prepared and I got so excited I had to be stopped from ordering more to go. I can't even say what I loved the  most! I will definitely come back to try more!

If you don't then expect to wait a really long time, even on a Tuesday night it was an hour wait. \n\nFOOD: The food is incredible. The dishes we ate were: Garlic Prawns, Chicken Pad Thai, Duck Fried Panang Curry w/ egg noodle. Squid Garlic and combination fried rice.  \n\nMy favorite dish is the Fried Duck Panang Curry w/ Egg Noodle. I wish we ordered two because sharing one place between five people just wasn't enough! The duck is fried so well and the crispy skin with the panang curry really completes the dish. We love egg noodle versus white rice so we added the egg noodle in, which is optional. \n\nThe Garlic Prawns is another delicious item you must try. The batter it is fried in is so tasty! It is seasoned well and tastes great when you dip it in the panang sauce. The Squid garlic was very tender. The chicken pad thai and fried rice was like other Thai restaurants. There was nothing special about those dishes. \n\nPRICE: It was a little expensive, but if I had only gotten the garlic prawns and fried duck curry I am not sure if I would be saying that. For sure this restaurant charges higher end prices for great tasting food. \n\nSERVICE: The service was good. I did not have much to complain about it. We waited for an hour and the hostess came to get us right away. There's also a bar that you can sit at and grab a drink while you wait as well. The server was fast to take our order and bring our food out. He checked on us a few times, which is always a plus. \n\nAMBIANCE: The restaurant is big, but the tables are smaller and closer together. It's always so busy so it's extra loud. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're trying to have an intimate time with someone. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here again for the fried duck curry and garlic prawns. \n\nHappy Dining, \n\nJ Tran"

I've had a lot of amazing thai food in NYC and not enough Thai food on the west coast or in Las Vegas in particular to make this type of statement. I will bow to the fact that everything is excellent and it makes me want to return to Las Vegas just to try this restaurant one more time.  Next time, I want to bring 10 people so we can order a larger variety of dishes and try a litlte bit of everything.\n\nFrom what I did try, here are my thoughts:\nBeef tar tar: Spicy, but not in an overpowering burnt tongue way. I could really taste the different spices put into that make it burst in your mouth\n\nPrawn salad: Very interesting combination of sweet and spicy. Prawns were huge and seared slightly. Probably the least favorite out of all I ate.\n\nCrispy duck curry: Crispy duck was ... very crispy. I think the coconut milk curry was excellent, but the duck could have been any crispy meat and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I just like this because curry is awesome with rice.\n\nChicken pad thai: This was my favorite. I can tell this place is awesome by how amazing they make their pad thai. The noodles didn't stick together and the flavor was evenly distributed across every noodle. The peanut sauce was there for the kick and not overpowering. Chicken was tender and a nice addition.\n\nTom Yum soup: We ordered this after eating everything else because we needed to get a taste of the other popular thing on Thai menus.  Yum. Must try. It wasn't lit on fire like at Jaiya, but it was delicious and the perfect amount of spicy and sour.\n\nOverall, I can't wait to go again. I'm a bit confused why it's in the middle of nowhere, but I'm glad this hasn't stopped people from taking the trek to get there and enjoy.  Be sure to make reservations because this place gets packed by 6:30"

The restaurant wasn't too far away. It was approximately two miles away from the Stratosphere. It is located in a rather big plaza with plenty of parking. The restaurant exterior was not much to look at. However, the interior is decently decorated and clean. After looking at the menu, my initial thought was this place is way too expensive for Thai food. Gave it a try anyway. I had the famous curry duck and various other plate, Which I do not recall the name (please refer to my pictures). They tasted really good, and I would go back for more given a chance. I would have given this place a five stars if the price is a little lower."

It's not just them that recommend this place because famous chefs such as Jonathan Gold and Susan Feniger rave about this place as well. It's no wonder that they have been nominated for the James Beard award again and again. Just remember though that because this place is so good, you may want to call ahead and make a reservation unless you want to wait 45 minutes to an hour. \n\nDespite the swanky acclaim, let me warn you that the restaurant is way off the Strip and from the outside it looks like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. In fact, Lotus of Siam is in the original Asian enclave of Las Vegas off of East Sahara Avenue near downtown so don't expect it to be glittery nice like the new Chinatown along Spring Mountain Road. Regardless, I like being in this rundown part of town because it reminds me of the old Las Vegas before all the dazzling excess when the best hotel in town was the Dunes.  \n\nLotus of Siam is a Thai restaurant, but its real specialty is Isan-style food. Isan is a region of Thailand that is located in the northeast portion of the country and is bordered by Cambodia and Laos. If only I had known when I was in Thailand because Isan-style cuisine is fucking delicious! \n\nUnlike traditional Thai food that people are probably accustomed to which is more sour and sweet, Isan-style cooking is more garlicky and spicy. The only way to describe the uniqueness of Isan-style Thai food is to compare it to the Peranakan \"nyonya\" cuisine  of Malaysia/Singapore due to its blending of traditional Thai flavors with Cambodian and Laotian influences and to the Korean food from Cholla Province, due to its spicier and more pungent flavors.\n\nSo on Christmas Eve, our party of four ordered five dishes because the portions are a bit smaller than your normal Thai restaurant. We ended up ordering the standard noodle dishes of chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew as well as a really tangy papaya salad. I literally wanted to drink the papaya salad marinade because it was so fucking good. For the proteins we ordered moo yang (marinated charbroiled pork) and nua yum katiem (charbroiled beef marinated with garlic and hot sauce that is served on top of Thai cole claw). \n\nAll the dishes were tasty, but my favorite was the Isan-style nua yum katiem. The beef had just the right amount of spicy flavors and mixed with the cole slaw, the combination was so good that I ended up drowning my rice in the sauce. \n\nAt the end of the day, Lotus of Siam shines because it offers Isan-style Thai food. If you come here ordering just the normal Thai dishes, you may not enjoy this place for what it truly is. I will definitely will be returning. S\u00e2ep lai lai!"

The garlic pepper chicken and the curry puffs were also good.  Staples such as pad thai were also present."

I had the spicy shrimp soup and spicy chicken wings (an 8 in hotness) as an appetizer, and they were excellent.  The Lemon Grass soup with chicken her husband shared with us was excellent.  My sister ordered the Yellow Curry and was excellent (I thought is was surprisingly mild) which we all ate portions of.  We craved more chicken wings and ordered another serving of even hotter (10 this time) and were just right. My only complaint was the servers could have removed finished dishes sooner and had to be asked to do so. My sister and her husband have lived in Las Vegas over 35 years and said this was the first time that they had been by Lotus of Siam where there was not a line waiting to get in, as they had wanted to eat here before, but had not wanted to wait in line to get in.  I would say this place would set the standard for all Thai restaurants to aspire to."

When we came at 5p it looked dark and abandoned however by 5:30p when they open for dinner there was a huge line waiting to get in.\n\nService:\nGood and FAST, we got our food a few minutes after ordering it surprisingly.\n\nFood:\nNam kao tod - The first bite of this salad was amazing.  The crispy rice is crispy and is packed with flavor.  However by the second and third bite, it was way too salty.  Would not order this again\n\nTom Yum soup- Salty but standard\n\nCrispy duck and drunken noodles- The duck was very crispy and good.  However the duck to noodle ratio seemed off.  There was like 80% duck and 20% noodles which I guess most people would feel is worth it but I like having more noodles.  After a few bites we were out of noodles and were just eating duck alone\n\nOverall:\nGood but not the best Thai food I've ever had and it's a bit pricey.  I feel like you can have the same type of Thai food at other restaurants for cheaper.\n\nTip:\nLong lines sometime but the restaurant is HUGE so it goes very quickly."

Lotus has had a few slight ups and downs in that time, mostly in regards to speed of service. In spring of this year they apparently hired a ton of new wait/server staff, and they are a young professional crew who do a fantastic job. The half dozen or so times  I've been there this summer the service level has been exemplary. Their cuisine is the most consistently delicious of any restaurant I've ever dined in, including dozens of michelin starred and james beard nominated. The best kept secret of Lotus' menu is the deep fried Lobster. It's always at least 5 lbs and runs $145 per, must call ahead to order or inquire as to the availability of Lobster. It's deep fried in the shell, then cut in sections and pan fried with corn starch sauce and veggies. The result is moist, flavorful lobster meat that comes out of the shell in perfect huge chunks! It wan't until about a year ago that my wife and I first had the lobster, we asked on a flyer on a monday night and they sold us one that was leftover from a party they night before. I guess they pre-ordered 10 and only ate 9, so we ordered it for just the two of us. There was a big party of about 20 ppl in the adjacent room and they came over in shifts to take pictures of our lobster, it's really that much of a spectacle! Other must try dishes include but not limited to: Short Rib in Panang, Drunken Noodle Prawn, Roasted Duck Curry, Crispy Catfish Salad, and I enjoy the snapper with thai chili and basil preparation. If you are visiting alone or with a group of 30 this is the place to go! Local tip: If you show up when they open (5:30) for dinner without a reservation, expect a 5-15 minute wait. 6-8:30pm expect a wait of 1hr+, after 8:30 10-20 minutes depending on the day. Make a reservation ahead of time, and don't be more than 5 minutes late or they'll cancel it."

            "review": "Having just returned to Las Vegas for a quick business trip early this week, I had to make a few visits to some of my fave haunts when I lived here. Of course, LoS was high on the list and it didn't disappoint!\n\nLoS always gets the following accolades: \"gotten the nod from the James Beard Foundation\", \"the place where all the local chefs come to eat\", \"one of the best Thai restaurants in North America\", blah blah blah. Everyone has said it, heard it and knows it. Whatever. It's great and still my gold standard outside of kidnapping my friend's Thai mom and having her cook my dishes out of my own kitchen!\n\nA few noteworthy changes if you haven't been there in awhile (since March 2010 according to our waiter):\n1. They've expanded into the now defunct Korean restaurant that used to be on the right side of the LoS.\n2. They've remodeled the inside...it's no longer the \"hole-in-the-wall\" greatness it used to be...everything is def. more upscale albeit in the same dive Commerical Center with the Green Door*.\n3. They expanded the old wine \"cabinet\" into a friggin' 15' glass wine cellar centered prominently in the middle of the newly redecorated interior. Way cool!\n4. There's a nice new shiny bar on the far right side of the resto - cool.\n5. 2 sets of bathroom now - the older \"boys\" and \"girls\" side on the left and now the much nicer and (thank God) larger (multi-stalls) \"men\" and \"women\" bathrooms on the left side. No more waiting in the hallways!\n\nA few extra notes/details on the food (this visit):\n1. We ordered four entrees (Pad See Ew, Mee Krob, Tofu Penang Curry and a Northern style curry made with catfish) and 2 apps (Tom Kha Gai and Tod Mun) for 5 people. Plenty of food and everyone finished up the meal for bill of $75 including 4 drinks. Not bad!\n2. Spice level was low for this meal at a \"5\"  b/c we were catering to a wide range of palates, but as a note you can always request the pepper rack for those that want more. Honestly tho, if you do request the \"10\"...it's spicy greatness and you won't be disappointed...but just be aware. I love it at the level. \n3. What I loved the most (generally speaking) was the delicate flavours of the dishes. I didn't find any sort of heavy handedness when it came to the flavor profiles - not too sweet, not too gunky (no fillers), etc.\n4. The Penang was incredible and had this beautiful creamy nuttiness to it....you could taste the complexities of flavours in it - a richness from the coconut milk, not too sweet, with hints of the kefir in it. Just a note, if you haven't been here...most dishes can be substituted for veggie friendly (i.e., tofu) and they willingly suggest it if you can't find something you like.\n5. The Pad See Ew was gorgeous. It had that high heat smoky flavor to it I crave in the dish. Not too sweet and a balanced flavour with the basil leaves - i.e., not overly \"basily\" as some places make it. So good...you could taste the individual ingredients in the dish!\n6. I wasn't a fan of the Mee Krob, but it was tasty and well done. It's just not my favorite dish for Thai cuisine.\n7. The Tod Mun is done the way I like it. Thin patties that are just luscious and perfectly seasoned/fried and complemented with the cucumber dressing. The crispness of the cabbage and the cucumbers provides the perfect textural complement to the home made fish patties with bits of green onions throughout.\n8. The Tom Kha Gai had that nice bit of sourness and just enough heat to start off the meal properly. A very flavourful broth with the bits of lemon grass and galangal throughout.\n9. The unique and different item was the northern Thai style curry - it was very broth-like but good. Almost reminiscent of the Thom Kha Gai, but no lemongrass in it. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, but found it more mild in taste and the flavours were *VERY* subtle and refined. So, if you're expecting bold typical Thai flavours...be warned and you might want to pass on this dish. Otherwise, it's a nice change from the usual typical dishes one can order.\n\nA few notes on service:\nExcellent as always. Not too invasive, yet not too rushed. We had a leisurely dinner therefor several hours - even after finishing our meal, we sat and continued talking and never once felt like we were being rushed out. They even came by and refilled out drinks while we talked!\n\nIf you haven't figured this out...yeah, I love and miss this place a lot. Living on the east coast now really highlights how different and how much better the Thai food is out west. Eitherway, if you're visiting or you already live in Las Vegas, LoS is a helluva good joint! You won't be disappointed. Now, only if they would Fedex their food.....\n\n*If you have to ask...you don't want to know."

Hmm... it definitely is one of the most expensive BUT for that price, you can taste that it is a notch above all the other thai restaurants.   We had something like Mi krop with sour sausages (one of their top 3 most popular), sea bass on top of drunken noodles (also another top 3 most popular), minced jackfruit with pork (something different since you don't usually see that) and sticky rice with mango.   Now.... the thing is that I've had almost all these dishes at other thai restaurants.  Each one of the dishes were slightly better (more sour, more greens, better quality fish, better cooking technique, in season fruits, garnishes you can eat, no fillers)  than at my favorite places in Thaitown in Hollywood, CA.     The owner here.... tons of people waiting and the bums in the parking lot asking for money.

The 8 of us girls made our trek here from our plush hotel on the strip.  The storefront is a nondescript hole in the wall, located in a ghetto, fairly vacant strip mall.  However, once we stepped inside and were greeted by the friendly staff, we felt like we were transported to Thailand. \n\nThe food lived up to all my expectations and all the hype.  Here are some we tried: drunken noodles, crispy rice, sea bass, a super spicy soup, garlic prawns. Honestly can't remember what else we ordered since we went mostly by our waiter's recommendations. We ordered 2 of each dish and every single one we gobbled up til we were practically licking the plate clean. Service was top notch and their massive wine selection was impressive. \n\nTip: on Saturday evenings, if you dont have reservations and don't want to be stuck waiting around forever, get there BEFORE dinner service starts at 5:30. We got there around 5:15pm, were the 4th party in line, and got seated immediately when the doors opened at 5:30.  Your welcome!"

I've had some excellent Thai food in Chicago and this place was easily one of the top five I have had. Wife and I went here on our last night in Vegas and it was a real treat. We started with a fish cake, Issan style beef jerky, and a crispy rice with sour sausage. The first two were very, very good and the third was OK. The jerky was excellent and not too tough. It had very interesting spices and the sauce gave it a nice kick.\n\nWe decided to go with the Northern Thai menu options since they seemed really unique. I went with Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry) which is described as being \"almost sweet\". It wasn't but it was very spicy. Not quite Thai spicy, but a litle strong. It did not have as much sauce or broth as I was excpecting but it was a nice portion size and was well seasoned besides the spice. Wife went with Khao a Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle served in curry sauce and coconut cream. Waiter recommended beef and it was an excellent dish. For dessert we shared a nice dish of coconut ice cream which was a perfect end to the meal.\n\nWe arrived at 7:30 for our reservation on a Friday and there was consistently between 5 and 10 people waiting for a table. Call ahead an make reservations. It may not look like much from the outside and the mall it's in is a little sketchy (multiple 'social rooms' like the Green Door and other similar places) but this is an excellent and popular restaurant. If you enjoy Thai food, this place is not to be missed. Why only 4 stars? Well, it isn't actually the best I've ever had but it is very, very good. There were a few things that didn't quite wow me but on balance a great meal that capped off a great vacation."

It's located in a dingy strip mall with some other international-looking restaurants (Indian, Korean) and a pool hall.\n\nMy only goal was to order things I'd never heard of and was sure I'd not find elsewhere. So, no pad thai or green curry for me here!\n\no Mashed Jackfruit and Pork salad. (They held the pork though, since she's veggie.) It was odd, and one of those things I could hardly classify as animal / vegetable / mineral. Like nothing else I'd had... kind of sweet, kind of planty, a little bit oily. Winner.\n\no I-ssam pork sausage. This was... well, just a pork sausage, cut up into parts. It came on a plate by itself, served next to a wedge of cabbage, some fried peanuts, hot peppers, and onion. I was expecting it to be in something, but I had ordered essentially at random, so I couldn't complain. I did get some tips on eating it afterwards from our very helpful server.\n\no Green Dip with Chile and Mushroom. This was a surprise. It was a small bowl of what tasted similar to Hatch-style green chiles, with mushrooms, in a vinegar & spice sauce, with carrots and cucumbers for dipping / scooping. Very southwesty... in fact, the sort of thing you might see on the menu at some creative Santa Fe caf\u00e9. Except it's a native northern Thai dish! Total winner.\n\nNone of these were mind-blowing dishes by themselves, but they were awesome in that they were different from anywhere else. This food is authentic (or at least not Americanized), it's cheap, the staff were great. The menu is huge and I will campaign strongly for a return visit next time I'm in Vegas."

But, as a caveat, I've only done the buffet, although I may be a rebel next time and order off the menu.\n\nAnyways, my experience has been that the food is generally always good; sometimes, it's better on certain days than others.  Like not a specific day of the week, but for example, sometimes it's better on one particular Wednesday than a previous visit on a Wednesday.  \n\nOne person at work eats religiously at Lotus on Tuesdays for the soup.  I personally think the soup is best on Fridays, not the egg drop soup but the other soup (the name of which I can't remember now).  It's mildly spicy, which I appreciate because I don't love super spicy food, and it also has the right amount of saltiness...really, it hits the spot as the chilly weather descends on Vegas.\n\nThere's also really good mint chicken, and the main chicken dish on Wednesdays is delicious!  However, my favorite part of the buffet is the fried banana rolls, which are always present at the buffet party.  Oh-M-Gee, I would marry those things, you know, if I wasn't already married, if it were possible to marry fried rolls, etc., etc.     \n\nI wouldn't necessarily crown Lotus the culinary king of the world but it's consistently good, flavorful and satisfying.  And that gets a good mark in my book!"

On a trip out here a few months ago, one of the folks in our party really wanted to go here so we ate here the first night in Vegas. I was looking forward to it based on the reviews but it wasn't anything like, \"OMG I'm dying to try it.\" Well, now I am OMG dying to go back. The meal was out of sight. Best Thai food I've ever had. We ordered a few dishes and sampled a bunch. I think you could just blindfold yourself and point to something and it would be incredible no matter what you got. This place deserves the rave reviews it gets. And it is now going to be one of my must-dos when in Vegas."

            "review": "The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fianc\u00e9e and me on our trip to Las Vegas.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  \n\nFor lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex m\u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \"curry-like\" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \n\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back."

I would often travel to Vegas just to eat there and once even flew in from in from a posting in Africa.  Since they have expanded into the wig shop next door, however, it seems that they care only about volume and not about custom made, tasty Thai food.  Last week I went for dinner my first night in town and ordered my favorite dish, their signature crispy rice with sour sausage.  I ordered it very got (8/10) like I normally do.  When it arrived it had no spice at all and was lukewarm.  It was obvious that they had made a large vat of it and were just slopping it out as if in a prison cafeteria.  The other dishes we ordered, panang curry and drunken noodles, were equally \"blah.\"\n\nSince this was my favorite place in the world, I gave them another try.  I went for lunch a few days later figuring that since most people eat the lunch buffet I would be able to get a made to order crispy rice.  This time it wasn't even lukewarm.  I hope you're making some good money now, Lotus, because you're certainly not making good food anymore."

We had reservations and were seated right away!\n\nTom kah Kai - (3.5 stars)  broth was amazing!  The lime accent was perfect and the coconut was not too overwhelming.  The chicken however did taste old.  If the chicken was more fresh and tender this dish would be a five!  Maybe it was an end of the night issue.. chicken sitting for to long in the back in the pot.\nSea bass drunken noodles - (4.5 stars) the Seanad was super tender and the light breaking was perfect.  The drunken noodles were delicious and the combination was supreme. \nCrispy duck in panang curry- (5 stars!) It had a nice crispy exterior and the meat was tender but not at all fatty. The panang curry sauce was a great compliment to the duck. We finished off the sauce by putting it on everything we could find at the table! \nGarlic prawns - (4 stars) my first prawn was very good with a very nice garlic sauce.  However my second shrimp was very fishy.  So much so that I could not get the taste out of my mouth.  Everyone else that had one said theirs were great so not sure what happened with that one:-(\nNam prik ong - (3 stars) we were super excited to try this as we saw it featured as one of Ming Tsai'd favorites. While it was tasty, the after taste really reminded us of ground beef. Also it comes with a number of veggies for dipping which wasn't as tasty as the pork rinds that also came with the dish. \nKhao soi braised Short rib - (4.5 stars) meat was tender but the real star was the sauce and noodles.  Yummy!\nThai iced tea - (4 stars) very good typical thai ice tea\nFried banana - (3 stars)  ok, not great.  Would not order this again.\nMango and sticky rice - (4 stars) we asked for two orders and they brought them out on one plate.  The mango was delicious but not enough sticky rice\n\nWe were a party of five and they added gratuities on our bill which I found off.\n\nService was ok but not great.
