I love the atmosphere, we were greeted and seated promptly at our arrival... We didn't wait too long for food, chef and even manager came out going around making sure everything was perfect. I would of given them 5 but our server guy kept forgetting to service our table and we had to repeat ourselves twice several times.. That was the only thing that irritated me all night. He was nice and apologetic at the end so we will give it another chance..."

We drove all the way from red Rock very sad place"

            "review": "So I had a gift certificate to this place and went to try it. Very contemporary compared to other Bbq places which I thought was neat. Oh yeah it's in town square  . So me and my boyfriend opted for \" The Lord have mercy\" $65 it has 6 spare ribs, 5 baby back ribs, 4 hot links, 1/2 of chicken and a portion of pulled pork it also comes with 3 sides greens (needs more seasoning ), mac n cheese ( needs some more salt and pepper) & french fries really good. They also give you 4 sauces a white one, vinegar based bbq sauce, a sweet bbq sauce & a spicy one which isn't honestly spicy the best one off the 4 though. I also ordered the Georgia margarita pretty good! (9.95) . Waitress was pretty nice but doesn't really check on you to much...  ! It was good NOT GREAT. I would eat here again but I would prefer John mulls by a long shot. If I'm in town square sure I would come but did not blow me out the water. Good atmosphere,  nice people and decent food and drinks. It came out to $86 for the meal , margarita and one dos equis."

            "review": "The pulled pork was quite juicy and served with a non-traditional, vinegar-based sauce which was very tasty.  The sliced brisket was served with one of their homemade BBQ sauces, although we were offered our choice.  Their sauces have a uniquely smokey flavor, although not over-powering.  The Kale & Cashew Slaw is very, very good, as is the Fries with Alabama White sauce.  Portions were so big, we couldn't to dessert, but definitely will leave room next time."

Vegetables were under cooked. Mac and cheese had no flavor at all. Even the corn bread was dry, over baked and almost hard. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here. $55 to go order that was dreadful."

It was perfect timing between the lunch and dinner rush when the place was humming but mostly empty. Turns out tuesdays kids eat free, which was freaking amazing, unexpected, and a huge bonus deal because I brought three.  ; )\n\nI had the brisket burger, because of an insatiable brisket craving I've been having lately, but it took almost 20 minutes just to decide because everything looked so amazing. Wife had the half rack of dry rubbed spare ribs which looked like they were out of the flintstones. Kids had bottomless mac, chicken fingers, and ribs.. $20 worth of food on the house.\n\nCouple of beers and three fingers of The Glenlivet later and we had the warm glow that accompanies a very enjoyable barbecue dining experience. Wes was great serving us and rounded out our night. We will definitely be back to try all of the items that we didn't get to order tonight, hopefully soon. \n\nP.S. amber beer is great with bbq, thanks for the tip bro."

            "review": "We took our family of six to Pot Liquor tonight for an anniversary celebration.  We ordered the pork belly and grits and chili for appetizers.  The pork belly and grits was amazing, though with six of us, we each only got a couple of bites.  I would order it just for myself; it was sooo good.  The chili was great, too.  \n\nFor the entree we ordered the Lord Have Mercy, and the Hog Wild, and we had so much food left over.  We really could have gotten by on just the Lord Have Mercy, but we thought we would need more.  The portion sizes were more than generous, and considering all the food we got, the prices were quite reasonable.  And, most importantly, the food was absolutely delicious.  With our platters we received five sides: 2 mac n cheese, 2 kale and cashew salads, and a potato salad.  Of those three, my least favorite was the potato salad, not a huge fan of the cracklins in it.  Mac n cheese was the best , so creamy and savory and yummy!\n\nThe service was fantastic; the atmosphere warm and inviting.  This is definitely a great family celebration place."

We are not ones to complain or send stuff back but when management and the waitress comes to the table 3x one must tell the truth. We told them that the baby back were dry and whatever they did tonight they should not do again. It's not like we went to a fish house n ordered ribs. We were in a rib house. To be dry well one could only assume that the ribs have been sitting to  long and were heated n served. We did eat all our ribs w BBQ sauce on them so we didn't choke. (Like I said before we so not send anything back. ) But I will give 3 stars  because the waitress was nice and the hoppin John sides were excellent along with the fries and the beers were cold . Sad to say it but we will not be back."

Didn't know about this~the BEST SURPRISE of all.\n    We had the deviled  eggs, burnt ends the pulled pork sliders all off the appetizer menu. All really good the only misstep was the sliders pork could have been hotter, meat was warm & tasty just not heated up enuf for my taste. Also ordered a side of green beans which were o site! Sooooo good, crisp just really outta site!\n    This is a good spot for this type of food, we would DEFINATLY return If were in the Town Center. \n  Be sure to check out the Bourbon menu, many choices you can't find other places and the Moonshine ain't half bad either"

Brisket and ribs were dry, and the pulled pork was ok at best. I have had a lot of bbq, a lot of it in texas, and this wouldn't last there. Sides were really good though, but not enough to bail out the boat on this one. After hearing so much about this place, we were looking forward to eating here for weeks as our vacation approached.. it was a pretty big let down. The quest continues for killer bbq in Vegas..\n\nWanted to add that we went there during happy hour, so it was 25% off which made things a little more bearable as it is a little pricey there..."

The owner came out and acknowledged us. Food was beyond amazing. We are from Kansas City and it was great trying their version of kansas city sauce.  Our friend grew up with Carolina style and he was able to try their version as well and loved it. The food is great, the atmosphere is awesome as well. Many more trips in our future will be made here. We live in the NW of the valley and it's well worth the drive. 100% recommend from a person who grew up having BBQ weekly."

            "review": "From start to finish, our lunch was a mess. To start, the hostess walked our party of 2 past three empty window tables and several interior tables until we were standing before a dirty table squished between 2 occupied tables. One table had 3 large guys, chairs pushed back against the dirty table, relaxing and enjoying their meal. The other table was just 2 guys but had enough room for an emaciated child to sit comfortably. We started to ask our hostess to move us but she quickly exclaimed that she would fix that and ran to wipe the table down, not noticing that there was not room for 2 adult women to sit. Once clean, she placed menus down and disappeared.   We moved the table so that both of us could squeeze in uncomfortably and dealt with it until the table behind me left and we could spread out. No plates, no place settings were offered.\n\nWe ordered pork rinds and corn fritters to start. The rinds were good, needed a dipping sauce or more flavor. The fritters were ok but the sauce was overwhelming their flavor.  Later we split the Cobb salad and butcher burger which was made easier after I took plates and silverware from a nearby table. No condiments came with the burger and we couldn't find our server to get any but it was decent as is. We paid extra for sweet potato fries that were cold and flavorless upon arrival.\n\nWe rarely saw our server. The gentleman from the kitchen who delivered our food also took the time to refill our drinks. That was more than we had from our server. We only saw her when we ordered food or she brought us the check. We looked around for a manager type to talk to but saw no one who seemed to be in control. \n\nA little history: we started coming to PotLiquor right after it opened and loved everything. After they took the catfish away, we started coming less and this was our return to an old favorite. And now we won't be back. The spark is gone. I know I personally missed seeing the French gentleman manager who always took the time to speak to every table. I believe service would have been impeccable had he or another manager been around."

I thought they were a little pricey for what they were. Also, make sure you only get the wedge salad if you enjoy a really strong blue cheese dressing, otherwise I'm sure it would have been fine with another dressing. Service could use some improvement. There were a couple big parties and a few other tables (2-4 people), but by no means was the restaurant busy, and it felt like we were waiting a long time for everything, even to pay our bill. I was actually not impressed with this place at all and would likely not come back, even to try the BBQ."

            "review": "The restaurant is gorgeous: red brick, floor-to-ceiling windows, mason jar chandeliers, wooden barrels, and local artist paintings. It's elegant and modern, yet casual. You can have a nice dinner or a casual lunch. I also love sitting at the bar with the very friendly bartenders! Oh, and the food is delicious!\n\nKansas City Style Burnt Ends ($10.95): Beef brisket point, maple bark, 'cue #1, Pullman loaf, Nevada Brining Company pickles. Apparently I'm late to the delicious game that is burnt ends, but now that I've had them, I'm not letting them out of my sight! I've had this dish twice and oh my gosh, it is GOOOOD. I mean, REALLY GOOD. Highly recommended!\n\nCrispy Fried Chicken Wings ($9.95): The wings have a great batter that is truly crispy and very flavorful and the chicken was moist. They're served with celery and carrot ribbons and spicy ranch. All very yummy. I really didn't expect to like this dish so much, but it's one of the better wings I've had.\n\nDevil'd Eggs ($5.95): Gherkins, Dijon mustard, topped with chicken skin cracklings. I love deviled eggs and these are great. I love the flavor of their yolk mixture and the crispy cracklings lend a nice texture against the creaminess. Another fantastic choice for shared bites or bar food.\n\nFried Green Tomato Salad ($12.95): Red onion, country ham, goat cheese, lemon caper and olive oil dressing. The green tomatoes had a nice texture (it wasn't mushy, which would've been disastrous). The batter was fantastic and held up with the dressing. All the ingredients worked really well together - the crunchy and aromatic onion, a little saltiness from the ham (thinly sliced like prosciutto), and the tart goat cheese.\n\nDry Rubbed Spareribs: Slow-smoked with a dry rub; finished on the grill. Delicious. I absolutely love the smoky sweet flavor of the meat. Serious yum.\n\nMopped Baby Back Ribs: Slow-smoked pork baby back ribs; mopped with 'cue #2. I usually go for spareribs, but the barbecue sauce on this one made me a fan. Oh, and it was tender. I still like dry rubs on meat better, but this sauced rib is just as delicious.\n\nLouisiana Hot Links: Nice snap and unique flavor. It's also not too spicy. Overall, good sausage.\n\nChili of All Chilis ($13.95): Ground beef, smoked pork, smoked beef brisket, red beans; served on corn cake. I'm pretty picky about chili and I can't even tell you anywhere I actually enjoy it...until now! The smoked meats really add to this dish and I love that the chili isn't too sweet (that drives me crazy). Also, the corn cake is so, so good!\n\nFries with Alabama White Sauce ($4.95): I know, they're \"just fries,\" but I truly LOVE these fries. They're delicious and that sauce is addicting! I wouldn't mind hanging out at the bar and munching on these all day.\n\nSides: Macaroni and Cheese, Hoppin John, and Collard Greens in Pot Liquor are all solid choices and really delicious. I don't normally endorse \"mac n' cheese,\" but I like theirs; it's not too heavy and it has a nice balance of flavors. The Hoppin John is their version of a dirty rice or rice and beans and I really enjoyed it. Another dish that I could just keep eating. To round it off, collard greens - just yum. I love that it wasn't just a pile of green goo; it was distinguishable pieces of collard greens that still had bite, but deliciously soaked in pot liquor.\n\nAt their grand opening event, I tried the Boiled Peanut Hummus (fantastic and so fresh; tasted just like hummus I make at home!), Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich (yummy; tender meat), Southern Style Chicken Sandwich (SO good! I'm definitely ordering this during lunch!), Fried Pumpkin Pie (light, flaky pastry with creamy pumpkin filling - yum! It was also not too sweet!), and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cluster (creamy PB center of chocolate with nuts; good stuff). \n\nTheir cocktails are fantastic! My favorites: Apple Mint Julep (J.P. Wiser's Rye Whiskey, mint, mint simple syrup, apple juice) and Cucumber Corpse (Prairie Cucumber Vodka, Grande Absente Absinthe, St. Germain Elderflower, cucumber, lemonade)."

Super friendly,accommodating and awesome staff from the host that greeted us who was friendly and welcoming to Nancy our waitress  and she was amazing and very attentive. We got the \"Go hog wild\"..Definitely enough food for 3 people .. Everything was sooo delicious Meat and side dishes , which is very rare.. My favorite was the pulled pork and the dry rub ribs,baked mac & cheese and collard greens cooked just right .. My children had the root beer float which they were nice enough to split it in 2 ( without us asking) I really appreciated thinking about our sanity and stopping a potential argument . The one recommendation would be to cook to green beans a little softer especially for the kids ..( I love Al dente, but kids probably not so much) We will definitely come back !!

No biggie. \nThe belini's were nothing special and then for the refill our waiter gave us mimosas. When asked he said- no it's a peach tangerine mix. NO, Peter, it's orange juice. \nWe ordered the hash and ham steak and eggs.  For our next refill my friend actually told our server, nope, that was orange juice- we asked for the belini like our first one and he comment, \"oh they're not strong enough?\"  I wanted to say - no, it's just not what we ordered, but I do agree they were not strong enough. AT ALL. \nMy friend ate her hash, her eggs were not cooked well. I ate my ham steak, not good. I asked for a side of some type of sauce to help with it, but they didn't have any. The little spot of grits- very good! \n\nAfter eating we walked around town square.  On my drive home I began to feel sick. Very sick.

I should have known right then that we weren't going to get exemplary service. We ordered, she ordered the skirt steak and I ordered the Cobb Salad with the dressing on the side and cornbread. When the food was delivered by someone other than our waiter she called the skirt steak something else so we weren't sure if it was actually what my friend ordered and this girl didn't know the food she was delivering or if the order had been put in wrong.  Also there was no salad dressing delivered with my salad. She ran away before we could get any words out.  And it was quite a while before anyone came back to our table. \n\nOne comment about the food. The cornbread was terrible. Dry, no flavor. My salad was ok. My friend liked her steak although she ordered med rare and it was overcooked. \n\nWhen we were done it took a long time to pay our check. It was delivered in a timely manner but he never came back for it. We tried to flag him down and one of the other waiters saw us gesturing but ignored us. I finally had to get up and go to the hostess stand to get someone to come over. When I mentioned to the hostess that our service was sub par she gave me that vapid blank look that 20 year old girls seem to have mastered these days as if it had nothing to do with her.  Anyone with customer service experience should know that at that moment you should get your manager. It was not a pleasant experience from start to finish and I will not be returning."

Liked the corn bread, but the honey butter was nasty. Liked the fries, but the Alabama white sauce was nothing special. Preferred the taste of ketchup if that says anything. The grits with the pork belly was by far the best dish. I get a bit sad when the mac n cheese is boring and this mac n cheese lacked any kind of flavor. Very disappointing! The BBQ pulled pork sliders was good and for some reason the tiny pickle was packed with a great flavor. For dessert, was a lovely key lime pie in a jar and a chocolate covered marshmallow turtle thing. The turtle had to be cut with a steak knife. Yes, it was that hard! Our server was the best, very attentive. Will give this place a second try someday. A couple of the specialty dishes sound promising."

While I had always been a fan of Famous Daves and Lucille's, I was more than happy to try this place that was offering a nice discount. I ordered the mopped baby back ribs which I shared with my wife. We got two sides with it. We ordered the Hoppin John and the Mellowed Candied Yams.\n\nThe ribs were among the best ribs I've ever eaten. First of all they were meatier than any ribs I've ever gotten in the past. Even with two of us sharing a full rack, we were not even close to being able to finish it. The portion was huge. They were cooked to perfection. And I really liked that they weren't swimming in barbecue sauce. They just seem to put a small amount on to give it a little flavor. They did give a small container of BBQ sauce on the side for those people who wanted even more. But to my mind the amount that it came with was close to perfect. The Hoppin John side dish was a rice dish with some beans in it ( not really sure what kind of beans they were). That dish was absolutely delicious. A perfect accompaniment to the ribs. The mellowed candied yams are also very good. They were a little too sweet for my taste but what should I expect when the word candied is in the name.\nThis is now my go-to place for ribs. Goodbye Famous Daves and Lucille's."

After waiting for about 20 minutes without any acknowledgment we asked two different employees where our waitress was. She finally came over with an apology that she didn't know we were her table. We then placed our food and drink order.\n\nAfter another 15 mins we still had no drinks, we once again flagged her down to ask where our drinks were. She came back with the drinks and left once again. \n\nAfter our food finally arrived it was delicious. They did attempt to make up for the horrible service by offering us coupons for the next visit and comping one meal. I will be back again for the food and hopefully the service will have improved as well."

We used to frequent a place Anthony Bourdain raved about on his show. Needless to say we are hard to please. My humble advice: skip Lucilles and come here. I will be back - likely during happy hour."

The food was fantastic. We had the pork belly and grits appetizer and the deviled eggs to start. Both excellent choices, although the sauce on the pork belly may be better off on the side because it is very sweet. Then we followed with the pulled pork sliders and a half rack of baby back ribs with the corn succotash and the collard greens. Taste, texture,  sauce and presentation were all extraordinary. The only concern I have is that they did not offer hush puppies or fried okra. I grew up in the south and those sides are staple. Being from the south, though, so many sides are staple that I guess you gotta stop somewhere, lol. The atmosphere was very casual and tvs at the bar make it a great spot for happy hour or sports watching. I will definitely go back and if you are waiting to try it, wait no longer."

I was super happy to find their prices were reasonable and the food and drink selection was diverse. \n\nWe started out with a round of the Cucumber Corpse. It was a refreshing drink that went down a bit too easily without being cloyingly sweet. It was accompanied by the deviled egg appetizer which was topped with some delightful chicken skin cracklins. Those were addictive!  We shared the Spare Me Baby entree which could have easily fed 4 people. You got to pick 2 sides, so we opted for the mac & cheese and greens. Both were delicious. Finally, we ended with the fried banana split dessert which had a scoop each of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream. Get this!\n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable experience accompanied by some great service. They offer a 25% discount during happy hour (M-F from 3-6pm and all day Tuesdays) which includes everything on the menu. Give them a try and enjoy some delicious smoked meats!"

I was very impressed :-) There is not enough beautiful in BBQ. The sauce has a layered sweetness. I added a side of the spicy sauce, which is mild for my taste, but was a great addition. The mac and cheese has a delicious crusted crumble on top. The corn bread is slightly sweet with a great corn meal. The must have dessert is the root beer float! It comes as a dessert glass with ice cream and chocolate chip cookie with a side glass of root beer. You can enjoy some of the cookie and ice cream before mixing, which makes it amazing.

In my opinion, their prices are a bit high for what you get, especially on their sides. \n\nLonger Review:\nPot Liquor CAS would be 4 stars from me if I all I got was their short ribs, their mac & cheese, and candied sweet potatos.  I have to admit, their short ribs is phenominal. I'm not a pork fan, but couldn't resist seconds when the girlfriend offered to share.  Their short ribs are \"fall off the bone\" and literally melts in your mouth.  But that was my girlfriend's meal.  Their Texas Beef Briskets is what I ordered and was disappointed.  It's a good portion at around 8 oz, but that was the only thing good about it. My briskets were rubbery, had no taste, and was dry at the same time.  I felt like I was eating a ham steak from a casino buffet not a beef brisket.  Good thing I had some of their mac & cheese and candied sweet potatos to wash it down.  \n\nI gave Pot Liquor 3 stars based on my overall experience.  The prices are a bit high, especially their sides, and the service was average. As for their food...just stay away from their beef briskets unless you're craving a ham steak."

Today they were out of coffee. Really? Out of coffee or did thy just not want to make any? The pork belly was Mediocre, the grits were great. The shrimp was flavorless and the crab balls were really flavorless. I had the chicken pot pie. The smoked chicken clashed with the white sauce and was slightly offensive. The sauce would have been better had it been a bechemel with cream.The waitress was okay, not exceptional. I will come back if someone invites me but I will not suggest this place again."

It's very simple to make great cornbread it was very dry and wasn't sweet, and that honey butter was nothing more than crisco and a little bit of honey. Now the Mac N Cheese no seasoned at all the cheese had no flavor Don't put  parmesan cheese in Mac it throws everything off. Mac n cheese is simple real cheese egg milk seasoning salt pepper that's it. The candied yams not enough sugar too much cinnamon and no juice. The potato salad was way too dry and the potato chunks where too big not enough mayo and of course under seasoned. The baby back ribs were subpar they weren't tinder like I was expecting but that was the only thing I actually found tolerable. So the one star is solely based on customer service. #notsorry"

We sat at the bar and was greeted immediately by the bartender! He was very attentive and answer questions about the menu!! \nAs far as the food, it's a lil on the pricey side for bbq! But they have combinations plates that give u a bang for your buck. Ordered the chicken/beef brisket/ pulled pork for $29.99... And it was just ok! The brisket was cooked perfectly, the chicken didn't quit have a smoked or bbq taste at all and the pulled pork didn't  do it for me at all!! The macaroni was really cheese but it wasn't that southern style Mac n cheese I was expecting! But not bad either! The bbq sauce came on the side and when we order an extra one, it came cold.. Now I don't know how others eat their food but I'm not a fan of dipping meat in cold sauces.."

It wasn't busy, at all so there is absolutely no excuse for it. You simply cannot rely on the quality of the food to overcome spending half of your meal with an empty glass. If the owner doesn't care enough to invest time into wiping the smirks off the faces of the waitresses and getting them to care about the customers, then it deserves to close."

            "review": "Very interesting place.  The tables are spread out, making it a good place to hang out with friends, since you aren't crammed in.  The decor is nice, the hostesses cute, basically everything you'd expect out of a Town Square restaurant.\n\nThe manager is super welcoming, has real conversations with the patrons, and seems legitimately interested in talking to people, not just the \"is everything fine?\" line that a lot of managers have as they run around the restaurant.  \n\nThe food is interesting and unique.  Here is my take.\nThe food is reasonably priced for Las Vegas BBQ, which is to say, unreasonably priced anywhere else, but thats par for the course here.\n\nThe meat is all smoked in a real smoker that uses real wood, I've seen the smoker, you can see the wood piled around the restaurant.   The pork seems like good pork (though I'm not a huge fan of pork), the brisket was very tender and flavorful, which IMO means its a shame that they don't have more beef products, I bet they'd be great.  \n\nSo what I've had thus far.\nBacon Steak - Uncured, its like a pork loin.  Its \"good\", but I prefer cured bacon.\nHot Links - Excellent.  The herbs taste \"bright\", probably freshly made there.  Not  spicy, I'd say a 5 or less, I can't perceive heat below a 7 at this point, but another person at a table said it had a \"kick\", thus my impression that its a 5.  It was a very \"different\" flavor, some might not like it, but I say give it a chance.\nMac & Cheese - I don't eat it, but everyone else seemed to love it.\nPot Pie - The pastry is puff pastry in an interesting latticework pattern floating on top of the chicken soup.  The chicken soup is amazing, the puff pastry is puff pastry (blandish).\nSweet Potatoes - Interestingly served with lemon zest giving it a citrusy freshness that I disliked and everyone else really loved.  They put marshmallow cream on top and toasted it, which I now do on my own sweet potatoes, but I leave out the lemon zest.\nBrisket Hamburger - This was amazing, a very generous portion of brisket, a great tasting hamburger, good bun.  Really tasty.  I ate my leftovers cold the next day and was yummy.\nFrench Fries - Yummy thick cut french fries.  Not necessarily fancy, but seemed fresh (but none of the burnt starch problem like a lot of fresh fries, which I like.\npork ribs of various types - nice amount of meat, smokey flavor, its pork, probably good.\n\nFor dessert, we've had the pumpkin fried pies and had brownie bread budding.  My friend loved the brownie bread pudding, but IMO it was overly toasted, with a slightly burnt flavor.  My friend likes burnt brownies so whatever.\n\nSo in the end, I didn't love the place as much as I do Lucilles.  Its not an apples & apples comparison, Pot Liquor doesn't have baked potatoes nor beef ribs, two of the most ordered things I get at Lucilles.  Pot Liquor made me go outside of my box for a lot of things, which is interesting and revitalizing.  My friends might want to go a lot, they seemed to like the flavors more than I did.  \n\nI would like to experience beef ribs here, and I'd like to try the brownie bread pudding again to see if they intentionally make it that dark."

The waiter noticed and he brought a small bowl of fries with ketchup. And you know it had worked miracle lol It's fries and ketchup. What kids wouldn't do for it? So I thought it was very nice gesture. \nWe went there around 4pm on Sunday. The place wasn't busy at all but the service was rather slow.\n\nOh let me not forget to mention, grilled bacon steak. Ugh! I want to bathe in those things! The light pickled salad came on the side was perfect for fatty bacon goodie. Acidity cut through the good kind of greasiness of bacon. And pepper jelly was delicious too. Not overly sweetened.\n\nI am looking forward to going back, on Tuesday next time. I heard kids eat free on Tuesdays :D"

Burnt Ends Appitizer was grisly and chewy. None of the dishes served were much to brag about. \nI predict it will be one of those Resturants that after a short while and the hype is over it will be gone.

            "review": "First off, I DO plan to give Pot Liquor another shot for dinner based on all the other positive reviews, but this review is for our Sunday Brunch experience which was pretty awful.  \n\nWhen we walked in, the restaurant was almost empty, so we were seated right away.  However, our party of 2 was seated at a 10-top tall table which was odd given the abundance of open 4-top tables.  Right after we were seated, the manager yelled at the hostess for seating us there with no regard that everyone could hear him berating her.  He sounded like an ass and I felt bad for her, so I told him that we would be happy to move.  He put us right next to the kitchen door in the far corner.  Yes, he was a douche.\n\nAfter we were seated, we waited 10 minutes just to have our drink order taken.  Then two large parties came in and were seated in the other corner by the flag wall.   They used this as an excuse why we waited another 15 minutes for our food order to be taken and 45 minutes for our food to arrive!  When it did arrive, it was cold!  \n\nSmoke house hash- eggs on top of a hash mix: brisket, potatos, pepperes, onions- was cold as I mentioned.  I couldn't eat cold scrambled eggs, but the hash mix itself was tasty enough to eat a few bites, I just wish it was warm.  I didn't eat the cold toast either.\n\nChicken fried steak- also cold.  I did not try this, but was told it was bland and tough.\n\nWe were not impressed by the service or food at all; and likely will not be returning for brunch."

If you're in Town Square shopping it's not a bad option, but I would not travel specifically to Town Square just to eat at Pot Liquor.  \n\nFirst off, it's pretty big and I've never seen it more than 1/4 full, so that would seem to bode well for service, but service has been hit and miss.  The last time I was there the server (I can't seem to remember his name) was pretty cheery, but very absent at the end of the meal.  He said he'd bring a drink refill for my fiancee and it took about 15 minutes to get it, and another few minutes for the check.  We were also overcharged for a side dish, but weren't going to wait another 10+ minutes to get it fixed.\n\nThe food is all slightly above average, but is priced a bit too high.  I feel like everything should cost about 25% less than it really is.\n\nI haven't written a review of it yet, but I really like Bell's BBQ in Henderson.  Good prices, big amounts, and tastes a lot better than this place.  If you're up in the northwest side of town try the Roadkill Grill -- that's also very good and reasonably priced as well.\n\nI will probably come back here, but just because I'll be shopping in Town Square sometimes with people who might want some BBQ."

Not at all disappointed. Service from the bartender, and our server were excellent. They even let me back into the kitchen to check out the smoker they use, and talk to the BBQ man. \n\nAYCE Rib night features Memphis dry rubbed spare ribs, and their Mopped Baby Back ribs, along with a side of Kale coleslaw, mac and cheese and corn muffins. This is actually a great bargain since everything is AYCE, not just the ribs. I'm surprised the place wasn't busier. \n\nGot there around 530pm so Happy Hour was still on, 50% off specialty drinks, beer specials, etc. Smallish happy hour meal menu. \n\nThe star of this show was definitely the Mopped Baby Back Ribs. Tender, and juicy yet firm just like I cook mine. The BBQ sauce has a sweet taste to it. These were so good, maybe some of the best ribs I've had in town. 5/5\n\n2nd star goes to the Kale coleslaw. A very light creamy mayo and vinegar taste that allows the crunchiness and flavor of the veggies to shine through. Has some cashews mixed in. Normally I'm not a huge coleslaw fan, but I ate 3 portions of this one and took some home as well. Its that good!!! 5/5\n\nMac and cheese was ok, not overly cheesy or overly maccy (Is that a word?) It was a nice compliment to the meal. 3/5\n\nMemphis Dry Rubbed spare ribs were also nice and juicy, yet firm which is exactly how I make mine. If they fall off the bone there's a good chance they were boiled. These do not. The rub has a nice balance, not too salty or too peppery, and actually has a hint of citrus. Very similar to my own personal rub. Some of the portion we received was smaller ribs and those were a bit dry. The bigger ribs were perfect. 4/5\n\nThe one weakness....corn muffins. These just weren't anything special, even with honey butter they weren't that great. I know they can do better here. 2/5.\n\nOverall, a great value for the money, 2 people for $40. Great ribs, killer coleslaw, and excellent service!!"

PL originally opened last year and we went during soft opening with mixed feelings mostly due to execution.  I'm please to say that those \"issues\" have been overcome and now it's worth going.  We had a big table at 9 pm so it was a great way to stress the kitchen near closing time.  The group ordered nearly everything so here are the highlights...dry rub spare ribs were the top hit.  Smoke and spice, and tenderness was on point and being dry, you control how much bbq sauce you want to add. Half rack was more than one large man could eat, making the full rack an obscene amount of pork.  Just as surprising the first time around, the BBQ chicken was amazingly tasty and moist. Baby back ribs were good too but the table definitely loved the dry rub ribs the best.  All the sides were good and wiped out.  For me personally, the one thing i would not get again was the pork belly on grits.  Could have been flavored more and cooked longer for tenderness.  As of right now, the king in town on pork belly/grits is still Echo and Rig.\n\nFinal thought, it's a great new addition for dinner at Town Square.  Not quite as good as Road Kill or Rollin Smoke but my new favorite dinner spot at Town Square and it's a full service restaurant/bar."

There is also a generous kids menu. \n\nLonger Version: when you walk in you are immediately greeted. The staff is very friendly and you can easily see that they work as a team. Kudos to the manager for sure. \n\nThe menu is basic, but does provide a variety for its size. There is also a large variety of alcohol to chose from (one of the largest whiskey menus I've seen). Most dishes are about $16, but the best experience is found in their combination BBQ platters that serve 2-8 people easy. \n\nFor three people we ordered \"The Beef The Chicken And The Pork\", a combo platter that included smoked brisket, 1/2 roasted chicken, and pulled pork. Each came with its own sauce (I suggest getting extra sauce for the pulled pork). The two sides we had were Mac n Cheese, which was baked, and a rice dish called Jumping Jon. \n\nThe Mac n Cheese was amazing, but the Jumping Jon was not. It was only ok. Mainly because it had a rubbery food product in it that none of us could identify. \n\nThe BBQ was pretty good, but did lack that classic \"smoked\" flavor one would expect from a restaurant that has so much fire-wood displayed. Don't let that hold you back though. Each portion had a great flavor and fed all three of us with a small portion left at the end that we took home. \n\nThe ambiance is very nice. The music consisted of \"oldies\" and the atmosphere is kind of a rustic Memphis-style BBQ joint with top shelf whiskey ready to complement the food they serve. The chairs are decent, it's easy to get in and out of, and the environment is kid friendly. \n\nOverall, I can see this place being a frequented place locals go to in Town Square for good food and great conversation. \n\nImprovements: bathrooms were not easily identifiable and aren't completely finished. Up that smoke! :)"

The Mac and cheese was good, although a little bland.  The collard greens were OK, but nothing any home cook couldn't do better with.\nGoing back to the lack of sauce for a minute, when asked for more sauce, they brought out a plate with 3 more half-filled ramekins on it, explaining they were the \"Q1, Q2, and Q3 sauces.\"  when asked what that meant, we were told they are three different sauces...

Speed of Service 5 out 10 probably due to staffing levels not individual, food quality 8 out 10. Food tastes great and was cooked properly. The sauces brought the score down, lacked complexity and none of the four \"cues\" had that heat you find in the south. Friendly atmosphere."

The restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived and we were promptly seated. Our server was very prompt in taking care of us and very helpful with suggestions. My co-workers and I started with a cocktail, I had the Raspberry Tart which was very tasty! We then ordered the burnt ends appetizer to start, and we then decided to order a variety of items to share so that we could try a lil bit of everything..... we had the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich, the Texas Dip, and an order of the Macaroni and Cheese. Everything was great- but OMG the Macaroni and Cheese was sooooooo yummy! Definitely a must try! \n\nI would highly recommend Pot Liquor! Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service!"

            "review": "Thanks to other Yeeps' reviews of Potliquor CAS, I decided I needed to try it on a recent business trip to Las Vegas. \n\nThe restaurant is located in \"Las Vegas Town Square\", which is a cute, off-the-strip shopping center that has really nice outdoor walkways and a large children's play area/park in it. It seems pretty new, and has a nice vibe. The restaurant itself is nice and airy, with 2 glass walls in the large space. It was quiet there on a weekday lunch \"rush\". The southern/country touches, especially the mason jar chandeliers, were fun and contemporary.\n\nThe first time I had collard greens (at a FoodTV chef's place in Orlando), I loved them, so I jumped at the chance to have some in Vegas. I also had the Burnt Ends since Yeeps raved about them, and I haven't ever tried them before. I really enjoyed the taste of both the collard greens & burnt ends. In addition, the service was very good. Our waiter was very responsive, and helpful when we ordered. On top of that, even though it was a quiet afternoon, I was very impressed that the manager made a stop at each table to introduce himself and ask how our meal was. Nice!"

            "review": "Took my mom here since she was in town for Christmas from Louisiana (also my home state). We have a lot of BBQ places back home so walking into Pot Liquor, our standards were going to be high.\n\nLuckily for us it was Customer Appreciation Day at Pot Liquor. That gave us 25% off our meal. We lucked out since our meal ended up being about $30 for both of us.\n\nMy mom ordered a half rack of the \"mopped\" ribs with collard greens and the kale and cashew slaw. She said that the collard greens were sweet and not to her taste. She is used to more savory collard greens in Louisiana... usually cooked with smoked ham so I guess she wasn't prepared for them to be sweet. The only recommendation would be that they carry the tobasco peppers in a jar on the tables. This is a common condiment served with collard greens in the South.\n\nShe loved the slaw and commented that the ribs were some of the best she had ever had. They were very flavorful and tender. \n\nI also ordered the ribs and they were awesome! The fries came with \"Alabama White Sauce\"--which seemed to be a vinegary mayo based sauce. I usually opt for ketchup with fries but I didn't need it since the white sauce was so good. I also had the mac & cheese which I personally liked. Keep in mind that it's homemade style and not like the crap in the blue box. TIP: mix it up well before you dive into it so the cheese gets mixed all around.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience. The service was excellent. When our server, Paul, was busy, the manager on duty had no problem stepping in and refilling our drinks.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean, spacious and beautifully designed. I will definitely be back."

Looked like poached chicken. 3 1/2 stars (see pic)\nCollards- Way too sweet for my liking but cooked perfectly. 3 stars\nHoppin John- Rice was mush, like a bad fried rice with black eyed peas and bacon. 2 stars\nMuffin-Best thing in the box. 4 stars\nPrice- $18.99 not including tax or fees. 2 Star.

We made an early appointment hoping to get in and out before it got too busy.  It is a good thing we did.  As it was, the service was the worst I have experienced either there or anywhere else in a long time.  Our waiter came by as we were sitting down and before we could even sit, asked us what we wanted to drink.  We placed an order and went on up to the buffet line they had set up for Thanksgiving dinner.  The brisket and ribs were excellent, but the turkey was pretty dry.  The sides were excellent, especially the dressing. \n\nBut back to the service;  We did not see our server again.  He left the dirty plates on the table as he passed by, he left the water glasses empty as he passed by and while we were still eating, he brought the check and was ready to set it down on the table when I asked him about desert.  He held on to the mini clipboard with the check and told us he would get a couple of deserts for us out of the kitchen and left.  Another waiter overheard him and stopped by to tell us the bread pudding was still in the oven and would be about ten minutes.  The other waiter brought us the bread pudding when it was ready and our waiter stopped by again while we were eating desert to leave us the check.  \n\nI will come back again because the food is excellent, but I hope management sets a few standards for their wait staff before they unleash them on the guests."

            "review": "This new-ish BBQ place in Town Square enters a long-line of restaurants that have come and gone from Town Square. Remember the cowboy place? And that one Mexican restaurant? Seems like everything gets beat out by Yard House.\n\nMy husband and I trekked here one Friday night. No reservation, I was pleased to see the place was not packed, but I think it was on the early-side of the night still for Town Square.\n\nThe inside reminiscent of Lone Star Steak House, except modernized, and no peanut shells on the floors. Pricing is, well, a little pricey I thought, unless you are sharing a meal, which my husband and I did. When we walked in the door we were also given a small coupon for a buy-an-entree, get a free-cocktail or appetizer. So, this worked out well for us!\n\nPork Belly with Country Grits ($11.98) - We started with our free appetizer, it comes out as two chunks of pork belly, settled on top of cheesy grits with some sort of reduction sauce (don't remember now what it was). Overall, it was good, cooked well, nice flavor combination. Would I order it for $12 without the free coupon? Probably not, because it such a small app - if there had been more than two of us, this would have been a bad choice.\n\nWhat's the Beef with the Chicken & the Hog ($35.98) - Texas style brisket, 1/2 smoked chicken, and Carolina-style pulled pork, comes with two sides, we picked the macaroni and cheese and the red bliss potato salad, because who needs green vegetables when eating BBQ? Not me! \n\nI was not impressed with the chicken, I thought out of all the meats, it lacked. They will also ask to up-charge you to \"all-white meat\" for $3 more, which I declined cuz I don't discriminate against the chicken... parts. Brisket was pretty damn good, and something I'd come back for. They smoke it well. I don't know what they do, but whatever it is, it produces some delicious meat. Carolina pork was also on point. I liked the fact it wasn't covered in sauce, which can often times detract from the meat itself. The meal comes with three different sauces - I enjoyed the watery au-jus type dipping sauce, and the (what I think) was a garlic-based white sauce. I did not like the overly-sweet BBQ sauce. Pass.\n\nMac and cheese was creamy and pleasing. Potato salad was, to me, perfect - a mustard-base salad with big chunks of potato, green onions, and bacon bits. \n\nWe skipped dessert as we were full and had plenty to take home.\n\nAgain, going back to pricing - I think this is what would keep me from going back. Our check was $40-ish dollars, and we got the app for FREE. Without the coupon we would have been at $50+, and we also opted not to get drinks, which probably would have set us back another $15 - $20. So, if we really wanted to go all-out here, it would have been a check for $70 for two people (no tip yet, btw). So, nearing $100 for a two person meal in Town Square? Kind of outrageous in my opinion.\n\nThey do have a brunch which I am interested in trying, so I may be back for that. But I think I'll have to venture elsewhere for BBQ, because my deep-pockets are reserved for other meals."

With cool decor it was roomy and comfortable. Lots of Windows that let in light and plenty of seats and tables. With a huge bar this place is legit. \n\nWait staff was nice and friendly and pretty quick for the most part as well. For apps we had \n\nThe Deviled  4/5\nThe Grilled Shrimp and blood sausage 3/5\nand The pork grinds 3/5\n\nDevils eggs were good just nothing extra extra ordinary about them good texture, flavor and creaminess that's all that mattered to me.\n\nShrimp had great chard flavor and the sausage you really have to like blood sausage. But for a blood sausage I like it just dried a little\n\nThe pork grinds were good had great crunch and flavor nice and warm but it taste just like the ones out of a bag even though you know it's fresh and not out of a bag. It would be perfect if you were to just sit at the bar and munch on these while drinking.\n\nWhen it came to ordering that was hard because everything sounded so good. My wife order the pull pork slider off the app menu with the fries which were pretty good. I'm not a huge pull pick fan myself but these were good. 4/5 fries were on point. Not pictured \n\nWe got the green beans and chicken tenders for my daughter. Tenders were good and crispy greens beans were long and skinny very high end even though they had very little flavor they had great crunch and they were yummy. 3/5 not pictured \n\nI ordered the brisket which was A M A Z I N G. Super tender and not too sauced. 5/5 the Mac and cheese was to die! Cheesy, gooey and came out sizzling in a small cask iron skillet pot thingy. \n\nOur friends got the burnt end which were burnt and chewy, caramelized perfectly but some might say it's burnt and dry....I like it not as much as much as my brisket though! 4/5 not pictured\n\nThe collard greens were Bomb I've never ever like collard greens before because it was just bitter and soggy these had great texture and flavor. Must try I think. 5/5 not pictured \n\nThe jambalaya here is another dish that I was not too cray cray about but here at pot liquid it was BOmB! Spice level is up there so make sure you like spiciness but the flavor and the tenderness of the rice and the shrimp was oh so good. I would come here just for this. Needless to say they converted me for sure. 5/5\n\nAll in all I have to say I really like Pot Liquor and you should try it if you haven't!"

Between the flighty server and the terrible food not to mention the system going down and forcing me to leave my card info wrote on the back of a scrap of paper I will never return to this joke. \n\nFirst the server, came gave us water didn't even ask if we wanted drinks. I had to ask him if I could get an iced tea. \n\nI do realize that I was at a BBQ joint but it was lunch and I just wanted a chicken sandwich. Ordered the grilled and was brought what appeared to be from frozen completely overlooked piece of processed chicken. To show the person I was eating with how bad it was, I took my knife and pushed into the meat HARD and it wouldn't break the surface. I was afraid to eat it so I ate my fries and the stringy tasteless stuff they called cole slaw. \n\nSo when we were wrapping up our meal the server had been MIA through most of lunch. It wasn't that big of a deal until we needed our check and he informs us their system crashed. We wait about another 15 minutes and nothing. Finally we tell him we have to go but their system is still not working. I ask to see a manager, when she comes over she says since I don't have cash to pay they will write down my credit card info and email me a receipt. I asked why they didn't have crash kits ready with manual card imprinters and call in my card like every other place. They said they didn't do that and I would have to leave my info. I asked if my info would be secure - definitely not a problem. So the server comes back with a scrap of paper and writes down the info from our cards but not our emails. Seems like s secure method for collecting your customers info. I take the paper write it down myself and ask for the GMs card. So the server points to a guy in the front and says that's him ask him. Well I thought the girl that came over was your manager???  Hmmm she must have been an assistant or FOH manager. So as I walk over to this guy who seems oblivious to his store not functioning AT ALL right now but some sales lady beats me to him. So this guy is taking sales pitches during lunch rush while I just paid $18 for an inedible meal and left my card info completely unsecured and he's too busy to talk to his patrons about the problems with lunch. I ask the host girls for a card so I can call him later at this point I've been there almost 1 1/2 hours total. I'm late back to work. \n\nStill no email receipt - but they the charge is shown on my bank account. Thankfully for now there's no weird charges. I'll be canceling my card today. Thank you pot liquor for making me not only a terrible lunch but one of the worst dining experiences of my life. And the GM couldn't even take a second to come to the table to say sorry."

On the way out, zombie hostess told us to \"get home safe and warm....\"\nPLEASE GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE TO EAT!!!!  I can't imagine that this place will be open much longer."

Our group was greeted immediately, however they had not yet set up our table.  I thought that was a bit weird given the place was practically empty, however I am sure they were guarding against a no show. The hostesses were friendly, but I could tell they were a bit confused and UN decisive about where to put our group.\n\nOnce we were seated it took a bit before our waitress came over.  Once she came over she seamed a bit confused and disoriented.  After explaining the menu we she let us have some time and then came back and took our drink orders.  Then the waiting really started.  It took a long time to get our drinks and then even longer for her to take our order.  By this time other groups were starting to be sat around us.\n\nThe waitress visited us once while we waited for our food.  Our drinks had run dry and we had to wait until after our food arrived to get refills.  Our drinks should not have run dry, we had iced tea and lemonade for the most part and those are easy to refill.\n\nWe had ordered 2 of their \"Lord has Mercy\" combo platters to feed the group.  The presentation was nice with an assortment of BBQ sauces and the sides were displayed nicely.  The Mac n Cheese stood out and that was the best of the sides we ordered (Cornbread and Grilled Corn Succotash were the others)  The Grilled Corn Succotash was very plain an not cooked correctly (the garbanzo beans were way undercooked).  \n\nThe BBQ was average.  The babybacks were tender without much flavor, The spare ribs had good flavor, but the doneness was hit or miss on the same plate, the pulled pork was disappointing as it was way too saucy and mushy, and the hot links had ok flavor, but did not impart any sort of heat.\n\nWe were not visited again by our waitress and our drinks ran dry again.  We waited forever for our bill, we got the wrong table's bill and had to wait forever again to get the correct one.  Once she had my credit card we waited again. 5:15 reservation we walked out at 7:15... We were not there having a ton of beverages, telling stories, and having a crazy time.  We just were having a normal family meal, should have taken 1-1.5 hours tops.\n\nI was watching the waitress when she was not at our table as I was curious as to what was taking her so long.  She had WAY too many tables... This is a management issue not waitress issues.  Her having that many tables was causing her to be rushed, flustered, and out of a pattern and rhythm.  She could not establish a normal circulation.  With our large group and another large group sat next to us she should not had 3-4 other tables on top of that.  Also, it is the managements responsibility to make sure the hostesses know how to properly do their job and train them well so that they are not so ambiguous running the front.\n\nI might give this place another try with my wife and try some of their small plates and appetizers, but as for good Q, I say eh."

We came for the Sunday brunch and while the food was good, we had arrived with very hungry children so we were needing food right away. It took a while for someone to come up and take our drink order and when they did we put in an order for corn bread and specified we need them right away. 15 minutes later the waiter came by to ask of we wanted him to put the order in. What!!! Our drinks didnt come until the food arrived. When the food came, there was no ketchup or sauces and we had to wait and wait and wait for someone to come near enough to ask. I asked for ONE refill on my coffee at the end of my meal (couldnt find anyone to ask for moruong the meal) and yet they were somehow out and said it would be a while because they had to brew another pot. What!! So I had one cup my entire meal, which if its a supposed brunch you better keep that coffee coming. Even if the food were stellar, if the service is not up to snuff I'll go somewhere where it is.\nSide note, the bathroom had no toilet paper and no hand soap. I informed the staff and since I'm with kids and make numerous trips there, when I went back there still wasn't any. I had to tell them again. I won't nitpick any further but there were lots of other issues I wont go into. \nThe one bright spot was the very sweet and accomodating hostess. She was a doll."

Not a huge fan of the pulled pork but thats probably more of a personal thing. The brisket is unreal. Its nice thick cuts, not dry at all, and good ratio of meat to fat. Every time I go there, I try to take someone thats never been and nobody has ever been disappointed. If I had to give one critique, itd be for the service. We usually have to wait for our bill or flag someone down for something. That said.. its one of those places I really dont care because the food is that great."

The gentleman who brought out our meals came back to ask us how our food was, but he sure didn't give us the nice speech he gave to the people in business clothing at the table next to us. Just because we were dressed casually is no reason to skimp on good service.

For Mothers Day we brought our friends and their parents anxious for them to have a good experience.  Unfortunately we were very embarrassed.  First our reservation wasn't recorded.  Because I remembered the name of who I spoke to, they honored the reservation and sat us 30 minutes later.  It took 15 minutes to get drinks, then over an hour and a half after ordering to get our food.  It came out sporadically with some meals cold and some hot, and not all at once.  The sliders were cold and dried out as if they sat for an hour.  (The person that ordered that dish became very ill vomitting later that day.)  We spoke to an unapologetic manager that offered nothing to resolve the issue.  Even stating that the food order was put in only 45 minutes prior.  So either he was blaming the server or we were mistreated.  But 45 minutes is still too long to wait.  Nothing was comped not even a soda, the tip was on the check because we were a big table.  That tip was not deserved.  Other tables got appetizers comped, but nothing for us until after we paid when someone from our party finally demanded some compensation for being there 3 1/2 hours.  The saddest part of the day was looking around our section and seeing the deflated mothers and families on what was supposed to be a special day.  I'm certain they lost many customers.  We will not return.  Las Vegas has too many options to tolerate this awful service."

Much to my surprise, we didn't need reservations. When we got to the restaurant, it appeared very busy on Friday evening (July 3rd). The lovely Ma\u00eetre D'/Hostess at the entrance asked if we had reservations (we didn't), she said no problem and found us a table quickly. They have both regular tables and high tables/high chairs. I personally prefer high tables, and was glad to have got seated accordingly.\n\nShortly after being seated, our waiter, Kristen B., approached our table to take the drinks/appetizers order. We ordered lemonades all around, and a Georgia Margarita. Personally, I'm not a fan of Lemonades that are overly-sweet. Thank GOD the Lemonade here was just right as far as sweetness goes. My parents decided they wanted to try the Smoked Wings appetizer. They aren't really into the whole 'wings' thing, as they're old school, but let me tell you, between both of them, they made quick work of those damned smoked wings LOL. So much so, that they got full just off of them, and they passed on entrees.\n\nAs far as entrees, we ordered a half-order of Smoked Chicken, a full rack of Mopped Baby Back Ribs, a half-order of Beef Brisket, and 2 orders of Corn Bread! Oh yeah, we came HUNGRY and ready to eat LMAO! \n\nIt took a while for the order to be brought out, which is understandable considering it was a busy Friday evening on a holiday weekend. We didn't mind waiting, because I knew everything we ordered was being made-to-order, and not sitting under a heat lamp (Main reason we came here.) When the gentleman came out with our food, I was surprised at the servings -- I mean they didn't cut corners on anything. The full rack of ribs had over 12 ribs, and the half chicken was a very generous serving. \n\nThe Baby Back ribs were very delicious, and it definitely helped that they provide you with extra sauce to drench all over your ribs with. Some places have ribs where the meat feels very rubbery, not here. The meat was very tender and the smoke on them was just right, not overbearing, as well as the seasoning being spot-on. You can tell that the people they have working in the kitchen know their BBQ. \n\nThe Smoked Chicken was very very juicy, and again, the smoking on it was spot on, not over bearing like at some other places we've been to, and seasoned well. The damned corn bread was so good, we had to order a 2nd serving of it. It's put into the oven upon ordering, and so what you get are three biscuit-style pieces of corn bred, which paired with their honey butter are extremely ADDICTING! If you're on a diet, you better make this your cheat meal of the week LOL\n\nOnly one other place I've been to has had Brisket this good (Fat Matt's Ribs down in Atlanta). Again, here you can tell that the folks at PLC know their brisket and they know how to slow-cook their Texas-Style Brisket. I'm talking about Brisket you put in your mouth and it just melts inside your mouth like it was butter -- That Good!\n\nTwo of us couldn't do all this food justice (The parents themselves got full with their appetizer, leaving 2 of us to consume the entrees), so we had to take some ribs/chicken back to our hotel (Too bad our hotel didn't have a microwave, but late night wings/ribs after a night of clubbing hits the spot just good!). \n\nBeing Las Vegas, a place with infinite dining options, it is truly a foodie city. What can separate one establishment from the next is not only the quality of the food, but most importantly (to me), the level of professionalism of the staff. I must say that Kristen B, and the gentleman who's name escapes me right now, made the visit very welcoming and pleasurable. Very attentive to our needs (we had a toddler with us, Kristen brought her a lemonade diluted w/ half water), and always making sure to ask if we were enjoying our meal. Very great dinner service with a highly attentive staff. You can't go wrong with Pot Liquor CAS.\n\nI will be returning in September with some friends for the UCLA/UNLV football game weekend! This is definitely on the to-do list everytime we hit Vegas!"

The staff is fantastic!  We were in with a large group and Leia was spot on with taking care of all of us. She had another server helping, but I was unable to get her name. She was also so friendly and a great server. We didn't want for anything. \n\nNow let's get to the food.  Oh. My. Gosh. It's amazing. Finger licking good doesn't begin to describe it. It's positively mouth watering. Slow cooked all day in a smoker and it's fork split tender.   Actually you probably just need to give it a mean look and it will fall apart in fear.  The sauces are great. I highly recommend taking their advice with how you pair them with the meats. You won't regret it. We met the owner and head chef Flip, and he was so gracious.\n\nI cannot compliment this place enough. We had an amazing time with them. They were friendly and engaging. I will definitely be returning (once my waist size returns to normal!) with all of my friends as any visitors."

Throw in some pulp to make me believe that lol. It was terrible, but it definitely didn't taste that fresh.\n\nMy bbq meet was already sauced with an overly sweet bbq sauce. The sandwich was okay. I guess I'm just comparing everything now to Rollin smokes bbq and I end up getting disappointed. I would not come back because the prices are too high for the quality of good you get. \n\nHowever, the wait staff was nice and the place was clean. The food was just too underwhelming."

            "review": "Just like to mention one thing: barbecue is the very  principle on which America was founded on. So now with that history lesson out of the way, I must say that this is a good choice for barbecue in Vegas. What I like about Pot Liqour CAS is how much they honor the main traditions of barbecue in the country: Carolina, Memphis, Texas, and Kansas City. And you can tell they do so with great respect to those regions. \n\nYou can get the usual suspects here: brisket, pulled pork, ribs, smoked chicken, and even specialties like chili or pot pie. However, what really draws me to this place is actually their appetizers and sides. The burnt ends are quite possibly the best I've had in town and are a meal in itself. Also the pork belly with country grits was delicious beyond words. As for the sides I wasn't a fan of the candied yams, but the fries were really good and with the Alabama white sauce they're a winner. The cornbread was also dynamite.\n\nIf there's one thing I find to be a noticeable flaw about Pot Liquor CAS it's that the food comes out only slightly warm to slightly cool. This has happened the last couple times I've come here and I really wish they'd serve the food more heated. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who has experienced this. Other than that, Town Square is lucky to have a place like this and I think it helps Vegas gain more potential as a good town for barbecue joints, considering it's up to its eyeballs already in other types of food. See you during Happy Hour!"

My friend ordered a drink and I opted for iced tea. \n\nIt took us a while to decide what to order since we were chatting but I ended up ordering some pork rinds from the happy hour menu and a baby back rib salad. The pork rinds were not good at all. Too salty and the texture was completely off. It was too hard to eat. My salad was decent. There was a good amount of rib on it and the Flavors were well-balanced. My friend got the fried pickles and the burnt ends appetizer. Both of these were pretty good. I don't typically enjoy fried pickles, but these were better than most and they were cubed instead of sliced or speared which was a little different than usual. \n\nPot Liquor didn't blow me away, but a majority of the food we ordered was good and I'd come back to try out more of their menu."

I came here with a co-worker who is not a foodie snob, but has very a seasoned palate. So it can be daunting to try and impress this guy. \n\nWe here came after a meeting for lunch, which was also my first time here, and I was taken back by the decor. It's great to see a place with such character surrounded by a location with a giant stale corpo feel. I'm looking at you Town Square. \n\nWe were sat and ordered immediately. Burnt ends and deviled eggs for the table and for me, The Texas Dip. Nope, this isn't a blonde bombshell with an I.Q. of 67, but huge meaty sandwich. This comes with hand sliced brisket, pepper jack cheese, cue #4 (spice level sauce), and BBQ au jus. Yes, there's a thing called BBQ Au Jus and it's drink worthy.\n\nThe Burnt Ends seem to be made from some type of magical animal. These little chunks of meaty heaven are tender, juicy, and should be served in a bowl with sauce and a oversized spoon for easy consumption. I would also sprinkle these on a steak or my cornflakes if I felt the need for a hardy protein addition during breakfast. \n\nThe deviled eggs were very good. I mean they're the cornerstone of any good BBQ meal or July 4th block party. They had great flavor and a even better texture, with the chicken cracklings placed on top. Great dish to order with a large group, but not for a party of two, they were very filling. \n\nMy main dish, The Texas Dip, was a flavor filled pile of meat that I openly made sweet love to as I ate. This beast was delicious, with piles tasty brisket slices covered in house made BBQ sauce, spicy cheese, all on a soft hoagie style roll. With the meats, cheeses, and sauces in between two pieces carby happiness, you might ask yourself, \"what could make this better?\". How dipping it in some savory au jus sauces. Food Boner level - \"FULL ERECTION\". Simply amazing! \n\nI will be back soon and wearing sweatpants to hide my foodie induced bodily functions."

We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.\n\nThis is a very nice comfortable restaurant in a sea of restaurants at Town Square Las Vegas.  It made it to the top 10 list of BBQ places in Las Vegas.   The food is excellent . . . absolutely delicious and the sides are substantial.   If it wasn't for the really slow (read agonizingly slow terrible service) and limitations on the menu we would have rated it higher.\n\nThe environment is welcoming and very pleasant with seating that allows a diner to look out and people watch as shoppers wander the Town Square.  Purified water is served (you can elect to donate $0.50 to help fund charitable endeavors bringing drinking water to places in the world that don't have easy access to it.)\n\nThe menu is limited.  You can order ribs, or chicken or pulled pork or the usual suspects found in most BBQ restaurants.  You can even get two of them together as a combination but not the combination you might choose. You must select the combination that is on the menu which is very limiting.   If you wanted to sample a variety of offerings from kitchen you MUST order a $65 combination and be buried in food designed for a large table.  All the choices are fixed. If you wanted to sample ribs, pork and chicken in smaller portions but as a sampler, that isn't a choice you are permitted to make.\n\nThe food however is killer.  I had a $25 full order of pulled pork with Carolina sauce, a huge bucket of Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad accompanied the pork.  There are plenty of side choices. My meal we delicious and was big enough for two meals.  The Boss had the chicken sandwich which was also delicious and plentiful. Very good job from the kitchen.  Delicious, plentiful and filling.\n\nNow the not so good. We were there when only 5 tables in the entire place had diners.  After an initial greeting, our server was not to be found.  She approached tables around us periodically and never thought to check in with us, ensure we had what we needed, re-filled drinks, or to respond to questions.  She was a ghost who disappeared and whom we had to flag down to  get routine, normal table service (like refilling drinks or to ask for a napkin).  She appeared completely indifferent to us and only moved with real speed when she brought us the check.  It was just so frustrating having to chase down service in an otherwise very slow restaurant.\n\nWe won't be back.   The environment is nice, the food excellent, the menu limited but the service is abysmal.  I don't want to spend my dining time looking for our server, feeling frustrated that she isn't checking in on us and generally being marginalized until its time to pay the check."

Even the hand drawn Sharpie art work in the restroom is memorable!  \n\nNow to the good stuff, I mean GREAT stuff, the food!

For my main course I order the Burnt Ends (from the appetizer menu) and paired it with a side of Mac n' Cheese (don't judge me, ot was our cheat day!)  Their burnt ends were out of this world!! The meat had very little fat, but was still bursting with flavor. They seriously melted in my mouth; they were prepared with a beautiful, tasty char without tasting burnt...absolute perfection!! They Mac n' Cheese was also tasty, but the burnt ends stole the show. I highly recommend you try them!\n\nOur dining experience would not have been the same without out Bartender Brandon!

We got the burnt ends as an appetizer and split the rib combo plate with candied yams and collard greens as our sides. After all that we still took some home! They were large portions. The dry rub ribs were my favorite. The candied yams with home made marshmallow topping were almost a dessert. I'm in love. Would go back for sure!"

We ordered off the normal menu instead of the brunch menu and our server informed us that we can still add bottomless mimosas/bloody marys to our meal. Can I just say that portions are VERY generous? We had leftovers for almost 2 more meals. The grits were cheesy and creamy, and paired perfectly with the slightly sweet and smoky pork. The 2 types of ribs were both delish, one more savory and the other sweeter. Both super tender, lots of meat on the bones, and great flavor. They give you extra sauce on the side in case you want to dip your ribs in them. Had the mac n cheese and collard greens as sides, both delish as well. Mac n cheese had nice cheesy flavor and collard greens had a nice smokiness to them. Wanted to try dessert but we were just wayy too full. \n\nI never saw bottom of my bottomless mimosa (and I'm sorry for being high maintenance, but I asked for just a splash of OJ, with mostly sparklies and they were nice enough to oblige).\n\nService was pleasant, water never went empty and server was actually quite knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nCompared to Rolling Smoke and Lucille's - I'd come here instead of Rolling Smoke because of the ambiance of the restaurant (there are real seats and it's clean, better service, too) and instead of Lucille's, well, because it just tastes better!\n\nFor the price, quality of food (and boozy brunch), and service, we will def be back!"

Our drinks were Sweet Tea, Sam Adams draft and one of their delicious cocktails called \"Bad Betty!!\" Everything was scrumptious and the service was great!!!

However, Pot Liquor was very disappointing.\n\nHighs:\n-Service! There was a French gentleman (owner or manager) who was very nice and our waiter did the best he could considering the ridiculous wait times.\n\n-Baked crab app was delicious.\n\n-Kale cashew slaw was delightful.\n\nLows:\n-Service was EXTREMELY slow.  Dining room was half full and it took 45 minutes for the apps, then another 45 for the entrees to appear.  I had beer but my fiance's cocktail took 20 mins.  Smoked meats aren't done to order so I have no idea what the hold up was.\n\n-A terrible smell, sewage or grease trap meant we had to move tables.  The issue was handled well and there were plenty of tables to choose from but be warned it was nauseating.\n\n-BBQ overall was not very good. The pulled pork was in fact chopped and both the seasoning and smokiness were tepid.  Lot of fat left on board too.\n\n-Chicken was mediocre and all the sides (except slaw) were under seasoned.\n\n\nI know that this place just opened and  the service issues could just be kinks but you have to nail the BBQ down. This place is pricey and it's just not worth us trying it again to see if they've figured it out yet."

And it feels like an interesting cross between a modern saloon and a speakeasy. It's really warm inside and inviting, so I really liked that! \n\nService: 4 - Don't know about everyone else, but my service was fantastic. Before I could even ask, our server pointed to us what the best meals were and specific favorites of customers in all aspects of the menu--food and drinks. He was crazy nice and always came to check on us and pour us another glass..of water ;) \n\nFood: 3 - You know, I'm not usually a fan of American BBQ, but I thought it was pretty good. Overpriced, but yummy. I ordered the half Smoked Chicken with the sides: Kale and Cashew Slaw and Collared Greens. \n\nThe sides didn't really stand out that much and weren't that great, but the chicken was really good. It was really soft and tender and delicious. I was really surprised. There was this dipping sauce that was BBQ flavored..pretty good. Nothing crazy special, but pretty good. \n\nFor drinks, I ordered the Hog's Nog, and it was okay, but it wasn't amazing.\n\nBecause the chicken was good, I would love to come back to try more food, so I'll see you again, Pot Liquor, don't worry."

As I was shopping with the family, we dropped in and was drawn in by the sweet savory smell of smoke, they should bottle this like a cologne. We ordered the burnt ends, pulled pork sliders and the Cobb salad. The burnt ends were as beefy, decadent and had just the right amount of crispiness. The pulled pork was the same great consistency and flavor of the samples I had tried earlier, and the salad was fresh with great toppings and dressing."

Server was good with food and beverage order taken without much delay. \n\nPurified water was served. It was better than most water in the Las Vegas area. Food order was Tri Tip Sandwich with Au Jus and Chicken Sandwich. Sandwiches are served with choice of fries. Fries can substituted for salad or sweet potato fries for an up charge. We elected for the regular fries. \n\nTri tip sandwich comes with cheese BBQ sauce onions on rustic loaf served with a side of au jus. The thin sliced tri tip, onions, cheese, and rustic bread reminded me of a Philly cheese steak sandwich. Bread was a little toasted but the light BBQ sauce au jus helped give a little softness. Sweet BBQ sauce nestling the meat was a good compliment to the savory and salty found through the sandwich.\n\nChicken Sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, BBQ sauce and slaw. Fried chicken breast was huge and juicy. Onion was sweet crispy. Slaw was light sweet and savory. Vegetables were crisp and fresh. \n\nFrench fries here were okay. Nothing exceptional or standout.\n\nGood chill place. Execution was good. Food was okay."

For $20, it sounded like something worth trying. We were looking for a low key dinner spot and this place fit that description.\n\nTown Square seemed dead, but Pot Liquor had a decent crowd. Looking through their beer list, although they have a respectable bottle and can list, the draft offering is meh. I went with a La Fin Du Monde that cost more than it should.\n\nOn to dinner. The first negative off the bat was that the butternut squash soup was being replaced with cream of mushroom. It sounded like a downgrade. Luckily, it was actually quite good. The main course featured very tender peach wood smoked turkey breast and confit of turkey leg and thigh. This was accompanied by a salty and burnt cornbread/apple/sausage stuffing. Fortunately, the rest of the surrounding sides were well made--the requisite green bean casserole, yams, mashed potato, and cranberry/orange sauce. And like the starter, the pumpkin cheesecake dessert was surprisingly good.\n\nTheir happy hour gets you 25% off absolutely everything (according to our server) and is available 3-6pm Mon-Fri and all day Tuesday. I enjoyed dinner enough that it would be worth checking out again during HH."

I really liked the restaurant: the decor was nice, the booth was comfy, the staff is amazingly polite and attentive, and there were two managers walking around.  The only criticism I have about the place (not the food) is it looks more casual than the prices suggest, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nDevil'd Eggs ($6)\n2/5\nThe chicken cracklings were the only strong taste on the eggs.  The mustard and pickle flavor were missing and they desperately needed seasoning.\n\nBacon Steak ($10)\n5/5\nI cannot express how delicious this dish was.  The cucumber and carrot slaw was very mild and fresh.  The jalapeno jam was bold and flavorful.  The bacon was savory and heavenly.  When you mixed the three together, it was like a fireworks show exploding in your mouth.  I need more of this dish in my life.\n\nLord Have Mercy ($60)\nI was sad to discover that brisket didn't come in this combo.  Brisket is my favorite, so I'll have to return to try some. It did include:\n\nDry Rub Ribs\n5/5\nThese were the best ribs I've had in a restaurant, hands down.  Perfectly smoked and crisped, they fell apart as you ate them but the outside was wonderfully chewy.  Flavor was amazing as well.\n\nMopped Ribs\n3/5\nI found the execution on these ribs not as good as the dry rub, but still good.\n\nPulled Pork \n4/5\nThe texture of the meat was perfection.  Super moist, it disintegrated as you chewed it.  I felt it was missing something flavor wise, but I would definitely order it again regardless.\n\nHot Links\n4/5\nSuper beefy.  Not quite hot enough though.  Good texture.\n\nChicken\n5/5\nIt was perfect.  I don't know what else to say... but it was good.\n\nMac and Cheese\n5/5\nFake cheese need not apply, this mac has all the flavor, creaminess, and cheese you could want!\n\nCorn Bread \n2/5\nI found the corn bread and honey butter pretty lack luster.  The bread was ok, but forgettable.  The honey butter had a weird consistency and lacked butter flavor, it tasted like milk and sugar instead of butter and honey.\n\nSuccotash\nI hate succotash, so I didn't try it lol.\n\nLemonade\n4/5\nSuper good, could use a little more tartness to be perfect.\n\n\n\nOverall we enjoyed the food and will be returning."

My guy owns two restaurants in town, so we might have higher standards than most. She finally came over and apologized for the wait. She took our order (it was easy to decide because they only have 4 breakfast items). She seemed to have a little trouble entering everything in the POS (Point of sale) which is ipad based. I didn't want to drink the bottomless option so I asked for a hot tea. I mean, who doesn't have hot tea? Them. Or hot chocolate. I don't drink coffee, so I settled for OJ. I also asked for a side of toast and she recommended against it because apparently they burnt it on the last attempt. I wanted to make sure I wasn't just looking for things to be wrong so I gave them the benefit. \n\n30 minutes later when our food still wasn't up, but a neighbouring table who was sat after us had food, I asked the food runner to check for us.They apparently had issues with the POS system so our food didn't go through. Another table of four said they had similar issues with the service. \n\nThe food itself was great.  Bartender was great. Server was just not good.

Right across from Yardhouse. \nWe weren't sure if it was open, because a.) there was no advertisements and even more important b.) no word of mouth. \nWe peeked in and saw a huge bar, and people eating, so yippee!!! a new place to eat. \n    It's BBQ. We love BBQ. Especially for lunch. The drink menu was the best part though. I'm a lover of handcrafted cocktails, and the menu had plenty!!!!\nWe were warmly greeted by the numerous wait staff, the hostesses, the bartenders, the busboys, and some business men in jeans and blazers (possible owners?) We were informed it was a \"soft opening\" and they were working out kinks.....which, as a slave to the industry, I understand. \nHubs ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I got a \"Texas dip\". Of course we also had a few cocktails, and ordered the fried pickles. \nDrinks were top notch....high priced though. $10.95 for a mint julep is a little much. Still delicious, and we don't mind paying a bit more for quality. Meals came out before appetizer, but they were working out the kinks, so I forgive. The sandwiches were delicious....obviously they know their North Carolina BBQ, all vinegar based. Tender and flavorful. The BBQ au jus was my favorite part, but unfortunately it was served in a tiny shot glass, so there was no way to \"dip\" my Texas Dip. Waitress brought another tiny shot of au jus...still was not enough. I was full, and figured they forgot the pickles, so I was ok with that. But then, here they were.....fried in catfish breading. Amazing. The dipping sauce was creamy and just spicy enough. I just wish I could have got them before our meal so I could enjoy more than one bite. \nAll in all, it was good. I liked the food, but it's a bit overpriced for lunch. I didn't even order sides, if we did, our lunch would have cost as much as a steak dinner in an upscale restaurant. We decided we would come back for dinner...they have half size meals and platters enough to feed the family for decent prices. Plus it's good BBQ. \nPros: real, slow and low cooked BBQ\n         Fantastic beer and cocktail menu\n         Waitress \"Dee\" super friendly, knew              \n         the menu well.\nCons: asked for a donation for water, yet \n          when we left and tried to donate a few \n          bucks, the hostesses had no idea \n          what to do with the $.\n          Way too pricey for lunch....almost $40 \n          for 2 sandwiches and an appetizer \n          that was served when we were trying \n          to leave. \n          \nGet some real lunch specials, a happy hour that shows the hours in which that happy hour is (not printed on the lunch menu conning your lunch crowd into thinking it was now) and get the word out!!!! \n          We will be back, gotta try some sides!"

            "review": "I was really frustrated with my two experiences with Pot Liquor.\n\nMy first experience I ordered my food to go. (This was roughly a month ago right when they opened) I'm a town square employee and I figured that order 30 minutes in advance would provide them with ample time to complete my order. I walked in and the hostess told me to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was prompt in providing my check and a glass of water. After that, the experience went downhill. Fast forward to me asking where my food was multiple times in the next 45 minutes. They still had not brought it out and I asked them to refund my card. Disappointment was an understatement. Also, they didn't reverse the transaction.\n\nYesterday, I opted to give them another try because I figured that the first experience was just a hiccup with them opening initially. They got my food out in an adequate amount of time, but when I went to eat my food in our break room, they gave me a grilled chicken sandwich when I asked for the fried chicken sandwich. I asked for no tomatoes due to a food allergy, and low and behold, tomatoes were on my sandwich.\n\nI tried to give them another chance and they messed up again, needless to say, I will not be returning. I was really excited about a different option within the mall, but sadly they still have some kinks to work out. However, I'll most likely not be retuning to see if those kinks ever get addressed."

Chef Doug, Flip, Francis, David, Drey, Hugo, Ernesto, Rachel, Amy, Paul, Jim everyone from the windows to the walls make this place not just a restaurant. It is a living, moving thing. It is a dining experience unlike anything else in Las Vegas. It isn't just about the food, it's about life. Brunch is absolutely incredible, have a razzle dazzle aid and the hash. Or the Bacon Steak. OR the Chicken Fried Steak. AND THE PULLED PORK WAFFLE. Fluffy pillow of a waffle, heaped with Pot Liquor Pulled Pork (which is nuts), and Spiced Apple compote, with Double barrel aged bourbon syrup. That's brunch.\nLunch, Sunday Chicken Sandwich with the largest chicken breast you've ever seen, fresh veggies, baked bun and melted slab of cheddar. Add a side of sweet potato fries and Alabama white sauce. Insanely good. Everything for dinner is good. Dry rubbed St Louis Style Spare ribs, huge and meaty, add the spicy bbq sauce. Mopped baby backs, fall off the bone with a glance. Smoked Chicken is smoked and flavored to the bone. The brisket, trimmed and rendered for hours in it's own meaty goodness. The boudin noir and griled prawn salad with citrus vinaigrette, deep fried freen tomatoes, pork cracklin and add the carolina vinegar sauce. Deviled eggs with fried chicken skins. Moinks. Meatballs wrapped in in-house cured bacon. Cornbread muffins with whipped honey butter, collared green that take hours and hours to make. Chefs Doug and Ernesto know how do do proper barbecue and the crew at Pot Liquor know how to make people happy. They cater, they deliver and that's the reason that they have been voted Best of Vegas. \nEat here once and you will be back again."

I had read about the House Made pork rinds and the deviled eggs so we had to try them.  They were both delicious!  We couldn't stop eating the pork rinds and we were so stuffed when our meals arrived.  I ordered the Memphis Ribs and my husband the chicken.  We could have (and should have) split a meal.  They give you so much food! We couldn't do it justice and since we are from out of town (and no refrigerator in the hotel) we couldn't take it with us (except for the leftover pork rinds).  The ribs were very good!  My husband ordered the collard greens and loved them.  The macaroni and cheese was good but we weren't too fond of the potato salad.  The owners/partners came by the table and even started pitching in when they got busy. I will definitely go back on my next trip to Las Vegas."

Overall a great dining experience for dates, parties or family dinner night :D\nAt our table we had:\nBurnt Ends Appetizer- cooked perfectly with a great balance of the rich, fattiness and jerky like seasoning.\nGrits and Pork Belly Appetizer- creamy, juicy, tasty and completely satisfying. \nBaby Back Ribs-  Cooked to perfection, fall off the bone, juicy and hearty.\nShrimp Po Boy-  Fresh, hearty and a lighter way than the usual Po Boy you find around, but could use a little more spice or Cajun seasoning.\nShort Ribs- A great \"pot roast\" like quality to the meat that left it flavorful and Not dry at all!\nMac and Cheese-  Creamy, not dry at all, a great crust on top and the kind of cheese they use in it is just right!\nYams- You can actually taste the yam!!!  Unlike some places that smother your yam in some gelatinous candy goo, Pot Liquor's has a wonderful, subtle sweetness and a fresh made marshmallow fluff.  Sooooo Good!!!\nCollard Greens-  this was my first time having greens and they were amazing!!  A great briny, savory-sourness with a fantastic bacony smokiness. I've heard that greens can easily be messed up and gross, but these, I would defiantly eat again!  Apparently, they use the pot liquor from these in their bloody marries too!  Yummmm!\nBeer and cocktail list was great!  They make their own lemonade in house and to order for your sweetness preference! I mean, there really isn't anything bad to say about this place AND THEY JUST OPENED!!  If they are still working out the kinks, then we couldn't tell.  Highly recommend this to anyone!  Oh, did I mention they prices were totally affordable???  Cuz they are!  We will be going back here before any other BBQ place in town."

            "review": "Who knew barbecue could be so refined? Pot Liquor just opened up in Town Square and we are so happy to have it.  I immediately noticed the pork belly with country grits, and even though I'm usually not a fan of grits we decided to run with it.  This paid off, just order it. Seriously, just do it.  They were creamy and cheesy, and had the comforting nostalgia of mac and cheese.  This was a big deal for me because I need to stay away from gluten, and this is gluten free.  There are little GF circles all over the menu so anyone with this allergy shouldn't feel left out.  I didn't even get to the pork belly itself yet.  It was almost caramelized, nicely seared on the outside, while being rich, juicy, and tender on the inside. Most places I've been to, the pork belly is usually crunchy or chewy (sometimes overly), but this was neither. It was on another level, it melted in your mouth almost like you'd expect foie gras to. I'm gonna say this again, it was almost like pork foie gras. \n\nI got the Worcestershire braised short ribs.  The presentation kind of blew my mind, it was on par with the high end dining I've seen in Scottsdale or Cave Creek AZ.  This flavor was balanced, Worcestershire can be overpowering or it's used so sparingly you'd be oblivious to the fact you're consuming it if it wasn't listed.  The initial kick hits and tapers nicely.  The meat is falling apart as you pick it up with your fork, and again, the flavors are overall warm and comforting.  \n\nService was great, the food took a while to come out.  It's still worth it but it's hard to make within a lunch hour.  I also understand this place just opened and we think the kitchen might have been shot staffed.  We were there the day before the official grand opening.  I think this place has the potential for 4 stars once they work some of the kinks out."

There is no comparison to this place in terms of the overall quality, flavor and taste. The salad was also very good, and a great compliment to the food.  I cannot tell you more about the bottomless mac-n-cheese as the ribs were so good that our kid did not eat much. It was huge, tasty and also came with fries. We never got to the bottom.\n\nd.

This was new to us but we both loved the flavor. However, it was advertised as crispy and it was not.\n My husband ordered the pulled pork, it had unappreciated chewy parts, no sauce, and no smokey flavor. He did not like the coleslaw. It too was flavorless. The candied yams were awesome with a sweet orange infused flavor. \nI ordered the beef brisket sandwich. The crispy bread, pepper jack cheese, and sauce to dip it in was one of the best beef dip sandwiches I've ever had. \nUnfortunately, we didn't go there for sides and beef dip. Our decision was, with so many other excellent restaurants from which to choose , not to return. My Korean and Vietnam vet did get a 10 % discount. It is important to thank our vets for their service and I appreciate Pot Liquor for  their generosity."

Pot Liquor should stand the test of time if they can get the locals thru the door along with tourists. Great value Mon - Thurs 25% off whole bill during happy hour. We had the sampler platter with ribs , sausage and pork plus all the sauces. Beautifully presented and excellent tasting quality. My partner had prawns with boudon noir ( black sausage ) which was delicious. Later we tried a selection of smoked bacon, smoked chicken ( which is brined for 24 hours prior to smoking ) and braised ribs. These were superb and I would not like to choose which is the best dish here. All were scrumptious.  For dessert we had fried pie with creme anglaise and bread pudding. I thought the fried pie would be heavy but it was light and fluffy with a melt in the mouth sensation. The bread pudding was slightly heavier but deliciously delectable. The atmosphere in this restaurant was easy and very convivial much like a downtown New York Tribeca hangout but with much better service. The staff were a delight and our server Leah was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and genuinely really lovely. The other staff were really great too. I know this is a newish place but it is always nice when the owners are present and mingle with their customers. They appreciate all feedback and  comments. All in all the Best BBQ in Las Vegas.  Hopefully it will stay around for many years."

            "review": "Pot Liquor is definitely the best BBQ in Las Vegas. I've lived in Texas and had BBQ from other regions during my travels so I can appreciate good BBQ and this is it.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the meat because that is the most important piece of BBQ. The person that created the rubs for their meats deserves an A+ because they are all right on. Before Pot Liquor I'd never tasted meat so good that I didn't think it needed sauce. The four different sauces they offer are great, but not at all necessary because the meat is perfect on its own. \n\nSecond, let's talk about the sides. They are all bursting with flavor. It seems like they slow cook many of their items because the flavor is in the food, not like flavors added after the fact. The collard greens are the best I've ever had with more flavor than the average greens. The hoppin john's are a creative dish that will leave you addicted. The macaroni and cheese is obviously made in house and nothing like the macaroni and cheese other BBQ places serve (in a good way). The sweet potatoes, oh my, the sweet potatoes. Another dish where the flavor is within and then topped with homemade marshmallow topping. Dreams are made of this stuff. \n\nThe appetizers and desserts are equally enticing. The deviled eggs are my favorite. They have a creamy filling with a salty chicken crackling topping. The pork skins come out still sizzling and have all the salt you crave in pork skins with a hint of lime to offset the salt. For desserts, my favorite is the hand pies. The crust is delicate and flaky with the fillings varying by season. The anglaise on top is so delicious I could just eat that with a spoon.\n\nIf you like BBQ then you must try this restaurant."

On being seated I asked our waiter if the 25% off promotion was still in effect and he said no. I sad oops, see you later because we are headed to Brio. He said give him a minute to confer with the owner and then signaled for us to return to our table. We accepted and ordered a rack of Memphis dry rub spare ribs plus sides of Hoppin John and mac and cheese. The ribs tasted very good and were mammoth in size though hardly falling of the bone.  We found the portion to be more than we could comfortably handle so a few ribs were left behind.  I would have preferred baby backs, but those only come wet. Though I am not a fan of mac and cheese, unlike my better half, our order was gooey goodness. The Hoppin John was okay, but not anything I would choose to order in the future."

We had the burnt ends and deviled eggs to start and for dinner we shared (between 3 people) the \"Lord Have Mercy\" per our server Tyler's recommendations. Soooo, delicious! I just wished we had room for dessert. \nDuring dinner the GM Adam stopped by to make sure we were fully enjoying everything. It's always a nice touch when you see management interacting with guests and not just their employees. \nThank you Tyler and Adam for a perfect experience. We will definitely be back!"

Per usual, we ordered a lot so we could taste a variety of things on the menu (and at least this time, had guests with us who were as enthusiastic as we were about doing so).  We had the pork rinds, deviled eggs, pork belly, shrimp & blood sausage, then the largest sampler platter called \"Lord Have Mercy\" with sides of mac, greens and string beans, then for a groaning finale, tried two desserts - the key lime pie in a jar and the bread pudding.  \n\nBrilliant. everything. absolutely brilliant. And we're a very tough crowd...\n\nAnd I'm betting we'll be back again soon."

I'm a Certified Kansas City BBQ Society judge, so I've had a lot of ribs and these were good but I've had better.  \nThe restaurant is cute with the Southern Bluesy feel. Waiters in checkered shirts to go with the picnic style checkered napkins. Staff was friendly.  I wish I could remember our waiters name, he was great. We luckily sat near a friendly couple that offered suggestions based on what they ate. I'm bummed their menu didn't allow for a build your own plate offering. We both wanted to try the chicken but also wanted ribs. There were no options for this.\nFor drinks I got the \"broken and Bloody\", this drink was right up my alley. Bourbon with a great citrus taste. Loved it. My husband got the \"Southern Belle\", also a good drink but refreshing and sweet.\nWe ended up sharing the \"Spare Me Baby\" with Mac and Cheese and Corn Bread. So the Baby back ribs were much better than the spare ribs which were overly dry. The Mac and cheese was tasty but also a bit dry, even looking at pics of other Yelpers Mac and cheese, theirs looked creamier. The corn bread was alright as well but didn't have that corn taste like we like, it was more like a sweet cake. The sauces they offer were decent.\nI'd give it another try but it's not a place I'd go out of the way for."

Pot Liquor was closing its kitchen, but when we said we had some people who wanted to eat, they actually kept the kitchen open for us. That was a nice start to our experience.\n\nThe place has some nice furniture and some weird touches to it. There's a portrait of a pig wearing Converse that welcomes you. The Bar is huge and has plenty of seating. The sit down tables are a nice dark wood and it's pretty comfortable seating. \n\nWe moved some tables to fit the 20 or so of us. The server was very nice and didn't seemed overwhelmed at the numbers. She was prompt and got waters to everyone. I also got myself a Speakeasy IPA. I highly recommend it if you like IPAs as it has the the aromas and tastes of the IPA and has less of that barky taste that some IPAs have. \n\nFor food, you are never going to go wrong with Moinks. They are bacon wrapped meatballs covered in a sweet and hot barbecue sauce. The bacon is crispy and the meatball itself is flavored well. The pulled pork slider is also a nice treat if you are looking for some snacks. If you are in it to win it, I'd go for the Brisket Burger. $20 gets you a burger of 8 oz of angus beef with 4 oz of brisket. It's huge. Your heart might not be ready for it, but your stomach will be.\n\nI've gotten some great service from this place. Often overlooked, you would do yourself a favor to get yourself an IPA and some Moinks here."

We were tired of the same ol' places that we normally go go at town square so we decided to use Yelp to see if any other restaurants in TS were good turns out Pot Liquor had good reviews plus we haven't eaten BBQ in a while which sounded delicious at the time! :P \nSo we walked in and immediately was greeted by a lovely hostess! She asked if we needed a high chair and gave us a spot to park our stroller :) My husband and I look pretty young like we are teenager parents and usually people don't provide us with great customer service and like to judge us or something. But this place did nothing like that which is rare for us. The customer service is extraordinary! We were seated right away and our food came out pretty fast for ordering all that food! We love our server, Brook K, she was super friendly and actually engaged in conversation with us. She even allowed me to replace my beverage with another one because I didn't like how it tasted. She was always prepared and kept scanning our table to see if we needed anything else. She knew when to get us a refill on drinks because we were getting low (when I didn't even notice yet!), she recommended different appetizers and definitely made it sound delicious! So we bought the BBQ meatballs wrapped in bacon which were yummy & crunchy with a dash of sweetness!:) My husband ordered the dinner plate which was huge! He has spare ribs and baby back ribs with two sides of Mac n cheese & French fries with a white dipping sauce. I tried some of his French fries, very crunchy and the sauce is so smooth. I had just the one platter of baby back ribs. Their bbq sauce is sweet, probably one of the best barbecue sauces I've had and much better than Lucille's ;) no offense! My sides were Mac n cheese and corn bread. Their serving sizes are no joke, their huge and can definitely share, Brook did warn us but we were really hungry and usually my husband can eat a lot so we got our own entrees. My son had the items on the kids menu, bottomless Mac n cheese and green beans. Let me tell you, their green beans are sooooo good! I dont know what their dipped in or anything but I could eat them like French fries lol. The prices weren't too bad at all! Pretty cheap meal for a BBQ place with huge portions! Our bill came out to 78 bucks! That included our 3 entrees, 1 beer, 1 beverage, and 1 appetizer!:) The food was super delicious, but a major reason this places gets 5 stars is for the exceptional customer service. Not only was Brook so nice and helpful, the other staff members were nice too even the guy bringing out the food to our table! The manager was there and even greeted us and walked around to each table asking how everything was. This place is child friendly and of course adult friendly (they have a full bar if you want a night out!) Thank you so much, Brook, for being our server and not judging us and accepting who we are as people. You deserved that tip and I hope you continue to do what you're doing! Thanks again, we definitely will be back & hopefully you can serve us again!  \nSorry Yelp I have no pics this time but I do hope you come out to try this place :)"

I know big parties are a pain in the ass but we had a reservation and the restaurant wasn't packed. It took 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks. We got a few appetizers and some didn't even show up til mid entree. Our sides for our entrees didn't show up until after we were done eating. Now that being said our food was actually quite tasty. The hotlinks and ribs were delicious. I'm not sure if this was just management not scheduling right and a new server, to boot. Someone had dined there before and said it took a long time for them to eat there as well. All in all our meal took 2 hours and 45 minutes. I would like to go back but probably won't, and If I do it would be in a small group."

Now, full disclosure, we ended up with a $60 bill because we added the greens and grits. Sooooo worth it! The bloody married were not our favorite. They were a little too thick and I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce in my drinks. We switched to bellinis and were very happy. Our biscuits and gravy tasted good, but were a bit on the like warm side (so were our fries). Other than that, every thing was delish! This is a great place for a late brunch and movies & shopping!"

Husband and I were early and our dinner companions hadn't arrived so we opted for the Baked blue crab cakes appetizer to start off with.  They were rich and good and fresh and hot.  A real hit.  When our companions arrived they ordered beers and to go with that we ordered the burnt ends appetizer.  These were tender, Carmelized plenty big portion we all enjoyed this plate very much. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the pulled pork butt.  The dinner comes with 2 sides.  I ordered slaw and the green beans and oh boy I'm glad I did!  the slaw I'd THE Best !  Creamy dice of cabbage etc just right size cuts and did I mention creamy!  Yes, not too sweet not too tangy just perfect slaw and a cashew kicker on top made this better than my grandmas and I'm not kidding.  I love it and I will seek the inter web until i find that recipe.  The beans came straight off the vine I swear, vibrant crisp cooked and I like green beans.\nThe pulled pork was melt in you mouth flavorful, smokey and portion good and would fill anyone (I took 1/2 home) which is probably why they offer 1/2 size as an option on their menu items lol\nI really really liked the vinegar sauce that came with this meal as well.  tasty like I've never had, glad it was paired with my dinner.  \n\nHusband and the rest of our party ordered mopped ribs they said were THE meatiest ever and good.  They enjoyed.  Lots of lip smacking and finger licking.  \n\nI recommend this BBQ smokey goodness, casual lots of elbow room and did I mention friendly.  \n\nI can't wait to return.  The only reason they don't earn 5 star is because I wanted. reAl deal southern bread pudding.  The brownie version of bread pudding with rum sauce and vanilla ice cream just didn't impress me.

But all in all, still very very delicious, tender, and flavorful. Would def order again, maybe even as an entree next time.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Worcestershire Braised Beef Short Rib-Charred green onions, crispy fingerling potatoes ($18.98). It was alright...wasn't very memorable. Kind of bland to me...and def didn't have that BBQ flavoring I was hoping for. Would NOT get this again next time.

Full of BBQ flavor!!! The two sides were great too. He ordered the Kale and Cashew Slaw and Hoppin John, which is like dirty cajun-rice with black beans. I would order those sides as entrees too.

The kids had the bribs and mini corn dogs.\n\nThe food and service was prompt and wonderful. The kids food came out early so they could start eating. The drinks were great too.\n\nIn another post something was said about the lack of baby changing station...that has obviously been fixed. \n\nMy wife and I are from the south. This is as close to good authentic southern bbq and cuisine as we have found in Vegas. We will be back."

I was greeted by the waitress and was told they don't service tap water with ice, but I could buy a bottle of water, for water conservation for $.50. As if I had a choice in the middle of a Vegas heat wave I agreed. The water arrived and it said sparkling but there was no bubbles to be found in the bootle or nor my glass. After reviewing the menu I quickly noticed the limited options out of beef, pork, and chicken. In addition EVERYTHING was \u00e0 la cart enclosing bread. We ordered the The Yard and Coop aka 1/2 rack of ribs and 1/2 of Chicken with two side a meal for two and hot links. The the ribs were favorless the \"half chicken\" was a drum stick, small portion of breast and a wing. The hot link was very dry and overed cooked. The collards greens were bathe in vinegar, the cubed potato salad was under cooked, mac & cheese was average at best, the canidad yams were tasty if the marshmallow topping was included in the bite, if not flavorless. The GM stopped by for a review and we asked for bread. He offered two cornbread muffins on the house which mildly redeems the experience. All in all, there are many other BBQ places in town and to be nickled and dimed over water and bread in the name of conservation, it can be better managed. I'll continue looking for a new places, but I no plans to return here."

We ordered an appetizer and shared one of the combo meals and also a few sides. The food was pretty good. I think some of their items were a little dry. The portion size was a little on the small side. One thing we noticed was that the bar is not set up very well. They have the bottles set up in a way that makes it very difficult to see what they carry. It just isn't very esthetically pleasing or neat looking. They have see thru glass coolers which is something they should think about changing. It makes sense that they want to showcase their beer selection but the other side is just unpleasant to the eye. I know they do a lot of craft cocktails but you can see all containers and mixers just shoved inside. They had this big tupperware container with what looked like sangria with plastic wrap over the top. The white wine bottles were all on one side and didn't appear to have any type of organization. These are the kind of things I look at as a customer and really are things I don't want to see unless it is super organized. Liquor selection seemed very random. On another note, the service was excellent. The bartender was very nice. He was very hospitable and he always checked on us. Food came out fast. Overall the experience was good, but it's not a place I'll be rushing back to."

            "review": "My young son Easton, wife Nikki, and I were in early Saturday evening and you provided your card and asked us for feedback regarding our dinner experience. Since we'd made a point of coming to Town Square to try the restaurant, we thought we would follow through with a few comments.\n\nD\u00e9cor: The big paned windows, dark woods and checkered napkins catch your attention and the Mason jar chandeliers, \"reclaimed\" wall flag and barn boards under the bar draw you in.  It's a big space but it feels warm, charming, cozy and inviting. The music and black and white photos throw back to a simpler time but the food makes a culinary statement clearly defined by the present.\n \nService: Your server and bus staff were knowledgeable about the menu, friendly and attentive. In a city where service is often overpromised, your staff delivered perfectly.\n\nFood: My wife says I cook a mean BBQ and with three smokers of my own, I know my way around fire and smoke. So, we ordered the largest of the combination platters to try a little of everything. WOW!! Everything we tasted was warm, flavorful and delicious. We particularly liked the ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken; cooked to perfection and smoked perfectly. All the meats were tasty and tender. My wife is a Florida girl, so she's familiar with most of the menu offerings but she never heard of nor previously tasted the Alabama white sauce.  It's a great addition to the other three, and provided for a contrasting and unique flavor experience. The creamy cast iron mac & cheese and crisp, sea salted green beans exceeded our expectations. We would have liked to try the key lime graham dessert or the fried pies, but we were just too full.\n \nImpression: Honestly, upon sitting down we were initially surprised by the pricing, which felt a little exuberant for BBQ. However, the service, portion size, quality of the food and presentation quickly squashed that first impression. Pot Liquor is upscale, rustic chic and the food, service and experience was definitely worth the price.  We'll definitely be back for dinner, and lunch!\n\nRecommendation: We really have only two small suggestions for improvement. Again, we ordered that big platter which definitely feeds more than two and easily could have served four. It came with three sides, which was awesome! However, the cornbread side only came with two small breads; not enough to share with everyone at the table. Maybe, in the instance when a party of three or four orders that big platter and they choose cornbread as a side, you could increase the number of muffins to four just so there is enough to go around. Everyone wanted a biscuit with that amazing honey butter! \n\nIn addition, remind your wait staff to promote your water giving initiative. It's a really good and unique idea deserving of attention plus it shows you're socially responsible, which makes everyone feel good. We didn't know anything about it until you brought it up in the hallway. It's a cool idea that makes a difference, so share it verbally, with a coaster or a table tent!\n\nWell, that's it for now. Thanks for asking us to share our thoughts. That too made us feel welcome and acknowledged. We'll definitely be back, and soon!"

Yelpers --  You MUST try the dry rubbed spareribs, yam, and kale slaw!  On our first visit, we ordered the Go Hog Wild and enjoyed the dry rubbed spareribs, pulled pork, mopped baby backs, and hot links!  We even had the honor of touring the BOH and checking out the smoker with General Manager, Francis Carneiro!  What a charming \"monsieur\"!  To find out that he has the same birthday as moi,... well, I adore him even more!  LOL!\n\nThe 2nd visit (tonight), we saw our favorite \"monsieur\" again and we also met the Director of Restaurant Development, Flip Arbelaez!!!  How cool is that?!  My man and I were raving about the dry rubbed and we jokingly asked Flip, \"What's your secret ingredient?!\"  He smiled and said, \"I'll tell ya but I will be right back.\"  Yeah, right... we all laughed and we proceeded grinding on our ribs!  \n\n10 minutes later, Flip came back with a piece of paper with the ingredients!  OMG!  How awesome is that?!  Love a chef who shares his secrets!    \n\nThe only problem with this place is that the darn trees are blocking the signage so you may drive past the restaurant if you are coming from the main entrance of Town Square.

We waited for a table and immediately upon being paged because our table was ready, the hostess tried to convince us to sit at the bar instead. If we had wanted to sit at the bar we would not have waited for a table to begin with. After placing our food orders we began what turned out to be a wait of over 30 minutes for our food. We had visits from both our waiter and the Manager during this time assuring us that our food would only be a couple more minutes. When at long last the food was finally delivered, my friend's side was on my plate, one of my sides was on his, and my other side was MIA. We pointed out the mix up with the sides and they did nothing about it. We also pointed out the missing side and were told it would be right out. After that our waiter basically avoided us and another 30 minutes later the missing side was still MIA. When the waiter finally came over again we pointed out that we were still waiting for a side and it was finally delivered 5 minutes later. The ribs were not worth the wait -they were the mopped ribs so you'd expect some amount of moisture but they were dry. The kale and cashew slaw was actually good, and when the Mac n cheese finally appeared it was only so-so. The Manager did apologize profusely for the overwhelmingly bad service but at the same time was making excuses about being slammed. Really? You are a restaurant at a popular outdoor shopping area. Maybe you need better staffing. At least he did do the right thing and comp our meal due to the poor service but that is not going to get me to return."

If you didn't grow up with BBQ, please don't think that what they serve at Pot Liquor is BBQ. Even Famous Dave's is better than this garbage.\n\nThe pulled pork was cooked at too high a temperature for too short a time, so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didn't break down like it is supposed to, making the interior meat also mostly inedible.\n\nThey serve what they call \"Alabama Sweet Tea\". To me, it tasted like unsweetened tea. In the south, sweet tea is extremely sweet. I understand toning it down a little bit for those not used to it, but this was extremely bland. I complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch, but it was the same.\n\nTheir sauces have the non-descriptive names of Cue #1 thru Cue #4. I had to ask what they were. I tried all of them and they were terrible. I think #4 was their \"Alabama White Sauce\". Instead of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat, it was basically 98% mayonnaise with a little bit of seasoning. Disgusting.\n\nThey couldn't get basics right, and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.\nExamples include:\n\"Fried Catfish Benedict\": Fried catfish should be able to stand on its own. hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.\n\"Devil'd Eggs\": topped with deep fried chicken skin. The flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.\n\"Brownie Bread Pudding\": bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination. Then they serve it with \"sea salt vanilla gelato\". If you asked for \"sea salt vanilla gelato\" in a real BBQ place in the south, they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.\n\"Fried Pies\": this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with \"malted anglaise\". What the heck?\n\"Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches\": sounds pretty straight forward but it comes with strawberry cream gelato. Again with the gelato!\n\"Kansas City Style Burnt Ends\": Another staple. But they shake \"sugar in the raw\" over the top. The burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant. Really? You can put sugar on meat that shouldn't have it but you can't put it in your sweet tea?\n\nI told them their chef needs to visit Alabama and learn how to make real southern food. They assured me that he HAD visited Alabama and spent a whole 10 days there. You can't learn BBQ in 10 days. Good BBQ chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it. Pot Liquor does not serve southern BBQ or any southern dishes. I may try them again in a couple years if they haven't gone out of business. Perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned to make some actual southern food."

Very bubbly and energetic with a cute accent.\n\nWe ordered the Beef with the Chicken and the Hog, sides of corn muffins (for me) and french fries with White Sauce (for the husband).\n\nThe wait was about 20 minutes or so for our food but once that platter of deliciousness was brought to us, the wait didn't matter.\n\nCorn muffins were yummy with a warm honey butter served on the side. French fries had a good seasoning on them and went well with the white sauce.\n\nThe brisket was incredible! So tender and juicy! I wished there had been more on our platter!\n\nThe chicken had a great sear, juicy and flavorful. And what a nice surprise to have the chicken served as an airline breast! (Boneless breast with drumette bone attached) When does one ever see that in a barbecue place?\n\nAnd then there was the pork. The Carolina Pulled Pork. WOW!! The smoke flavor in that pork was just amazing!! I want to go back for lunch just to have that pork in a sandwich.\n\nOur platter came with a few sauces, Cue #2 which had a great kick, the vinegar based one which I loved and the white, mayo based sauce.\n\nI personally liked the kick of 'cue #2 mixed with the vinegar base of the other :)\n\nWe enjoyed our meal and will return again. \n\nThanks to GM John for coming over and introducing himself. Welcome to the neighborhood, Pot Liquor CAS."

Not only is it the best BBQ I've ever had - the place itself is very cool, with its huge windows, shady corner, and massive \"warehouse\" ceilings - very SoHo feeling. Furthermore, the service was great. We had brunch Saturday at the bar, where we had several bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary-s AND our yummy meals for $20 each. Andre was very friendly and attentive. We also met the Asst. Mgr., Taylor, who was very cute and personable - she made us feel very welcome. We went back again the next Tuesday - great again! The BOGO deals! There we met Brandon, our bartender and Bar Mgr. VERY GRACIOUS and the drinks were big and yummy. My husband and I even met the owner Flip, who made his way through the bar area speaking with customers - a genuinely talented guy, who knows how to treat people and meat  Thanks to the gang - we'll be back again soon."

However, The BBQ it's self was nothing to write home about. It was good. I am not saying I left anything on my plate. But Rollin' Smoke and John Mull's is light years ahead as far as taste and quality. So if you are shopping at town square, it's a good option. If you are looking for the best BBQ in the city, go to Rollin' Smoke or John Mulls Road Kill Grill."

It took forever for us to get our drinks and then all our glasses stayed empty for over 10 minutes. The service was extremely slow.  When the food came out everyone was served except for the two people who ordered salads. I guess they had a problem changing the chicken in the salad. Their salads were delivered 10 minutes after everyone else's food and then the salads didn't have avocado as they should have. Some people in our party were disappointed with the quality of the food. Our waitress seemed disinterested in our concerns.  Our finished plates stayed on the table for over 20 minutes until they were picked up. This was not the experience we had hoped to celebrate my dad's 77th birthday. Needless to say we won't be coming back."

The only thing I thought was odd was Happy Hour is only served at the bar and not the dining area. My husband and I both ordered ribs I got the yams and corn bread as a side and my husband got the Mac and cheese and French fries. The ribs were the best we've had in town and we have been to Famous Daves (multiple times) and Lucille's. The ribs have a different smokey taste and the BBQ sauce is superb! The ribs I got came with more of a sweet sauce which I really liked. The yams have marshmallows on top and it was delish!! The corn bread comes with honey butter and the Mac and cheese was pretty good. Overall I thought it was a great experience. Our waitress, Sarah was on point and very attentive and the food was awesome!! The only recommendations I have are to have Happy Hour in the dining areas and not just bar and possibly add a dinner for two option. You find these options at famous Daves which is a really good value and convenient. We will definitely be back to Pot Liquor!"

            "review": "Pretty happy with my first meal of the year in 2015. The family and I decided to hit up the new Town Square BBQ joint called Pot Liquor. I was thrilled when there wasn't a huge crowd for the holiday. It smelled delicious upon entry, and my expectations were pretty high. \nThere was a beautiful chandelier made from musical instruments that was a perfect decor for the atmosphere they were going for. Jazzy, blues, Bbq, bar yet family style type of place. The staff was friendly, and seemed to already have regular customers as they recognized numerous guests. \nMy family ordered three appetizers; pork rinds, deviled eggs, and burnt ends. The deviled eggs came with a chicken skin crisp crumble over the top and added a spectacular crunch. The pork rinds were basic but good. And the burnt ends were the first thing gone on the table. We were also presented a sauce sampler with four different styles of sauce to pair with your meat. The first, a sweet classic barbeque sauce. The second was similar to the first, but more spicy than sweet. I would have preferred more spice actually. The third was a cider vinegar they suggest you try with pork. I enjoyed it, the vinegar was not too overwhelming. And then my personal favorite, the white sauce. They describe this as, mayo, horseradish, and seasonings. Don't pass up on the random white sauce, its freakin' great! \nFor our entree we went with a Lord Have Mercy platter. The waitress insisted that with all this meat, between the four of us, we would most likely have leftovers. (Note: myself, my bf, our kids ages 17 & 12) The entree included:  1/2 smoked chicken, 6 baby back ribs, 6 dry rubbed spareribs, Carolina pulled pork, 4 Louisiana hot links and three sides. Let's just say, we were stuffed, yet our waitress was indeed impressed. Everything had a real smoked flavor. No shortcuts used with this BBQ. \nI also got an order of the breakfast brisket hash, because for $20 it came with unlimited Bloody Mary's, so that was a deal in itself! This is usually a weekend brunch special, but they were offering it because of the holiday. The bloody was great, I had 3 of them, and was feeling it towards the end. \nDon't ask me how we ate dessert, but we did. I felt like a family of food critics trying everything on the menu, the kids did great. We had the deep fried banana split (huge and awesome) and the strawberry shortcake sandwiches. Just get those, don't even ask, just do it. \nDuring our meal, the general manager Francis stopped by our table to ensure satisfaction. Although he was a Cowboys fan, we set aside our football differences and he gave us a coupon for 10% off, that we were able to use that day. The waitress even let us keep the coupon, which is cool because we totally will be returning to this place."

            "review": "I came across Pot Liquors as I was walking around Town Square the other night. I was checking out the menu when the hostess came out to talk a little about the restaurant. She mentioned they were doing a \"Thanksgiving Meal\". So doing a little more research on the places, reading a lot of positive reviews, I convinced my mom to cancel our original plans and to try this new restaurant instead. Unfortunately that was a big mistake. \n\nI really wanted to like this place after reading all the reviews on the food and the service. The same hostess that I encountered the other night sat us rather promptly. That was probably the only positive thing about our experience. It all went down hill from there. From the time we got sat, it took 15 minutes for a server to come over and help us. And if it wasnt for the hostess walking by asking us if a server had helped us yet, we'd probably still be there waiting for a server. And it wasnt that busy. Finally a young server named Kristen showed up and took our order. My mom and I ordered the special thanksgiving meal. The drinks arrived promptly. Several minutes later the server came back to inform us that they were out of the butternut squash soup and asked if cream of mushroom would be ok to substitute. I really didnt care either way. 10 minutes after she took our order the soup finally arrived. I wish it would have stayed back in the kitchen. The temperature was luke warm at best. At least I didnt have to worry about burning myself. After finishing our soups another 15 minutes passed before our main entrees arrived. That's probably because they were sitting out for 15 minutes, allowing them to cool down. Not one item of food on the plate was hot. Again, like the soup, everything was luke warm. I pushed the plate to the side and waiting for our server to stop by. Unfortunately she was too busy watching football at the bar. I had to walk up to get her and tell her our food was cold. She apologized and took it back. Maybe a little more than 5 minutes later she come back with new plates. Unfortunately nothing changed. Everything on the plate was still luke warm. The gravy on the turkey was actually congealed. A sign that it had been sitting out and cooled. Again I pushed the plate to the side. This time I got up to get a manager. The plates got taken back a 2nd time. Then the manager came back and asked if we would like something else instead of the Thanksgiving menu. After a few minutes we decided to try it a 3rd time. Before this, the manager came back to try to explain about the turkey and why it was a little cool. The turkey wasnt the problem, it was everything else that was cold. The manager was even on the verge of being argumentative, saying the the chefs personally prepared the 2nd dish and blah blah blah. A 3rd version of the meal came, personally served by the manager. I was hoping that the 3rd time's a charm. But it was the same thing. A cold meal. And this time my mom's plate didnt have the sweet potatoes. Instead it had this sauerkraut looking type side. Still wasnt sure what it was. My mom barely at anything on her plate. I did finish my meal, only because I was hungry. Needless to say we also didnt see the manager stop by for the rest of the night. Guess he really didnt care if we were happy with our 3rd round.\n\nThe previous reviewer, Ryan R. I wish I would have had your meal. And while my mom was waiting for me to pay the bill she was talking with 2 couples outside who loved their experience. They said everything they had was excellent. Again, I wish I had their meal instead of what we were served.\n\nNow the million dollar question. Would I go back? Probably not. As much as I want to try their BBQ it is a little on the expensive side. I can get a kick-ass BBQ meal at Jack Stacks in KC, MO and pay half the price. If I do return to Pot Liquors, it will be to have a drink at the bar, just to see a cute female asian bartender who is covered in tattoos. Just because I am in to that sort of thing.\n\nWe should have stuck with the reservations at Mimi's."

The Key Lime pie was a pleasant end to a great meal, tasty and it had a very nice presentation. \n\nMy only gripe is the price point, just on the basis of the main meal I know I can get higher quality barbecue with bigger portions for a cheaper price. However, if I happen to walk around Town Square and have a craving for a BBQ, I'd still consider going back. I do want to try the Burnt Ends and find out if it's as good as people say it is."

Their mac and cheese and fabulous and the green beans were actually seasoned. I APPRECIATE seasoned veggies!\n\nWhat I also loved is that they actually give you a half rack of ribs. In most other BBQ joints, a half rack means 3 or 4 ribs. Um, no? We're not stupid. We can do math. And we know there are normally 12 ribs in a rack. We also know that half of 12 is 6. So thank you Pot Liquor for not insulting our intelligence.\n\nBy the way the ribs are great. But a bunch of meat and membrane got stuck in my teeth. Not sure what that was about...but still great flavor and good sauce."

For as many restaurants going for the repurposed look with reclaimed wood and industrial metal top bar they do it very well. I heard great things about the pork cheek over grits. It was amazing! The server asked about 3 times if we were ready to order. With this unique take on bbq I wish she would have taken some more time to tour guide us on the menu. None the less she was very attentive and friendly. I will come back with friends!"

You get a choice of smokehouse hash, chicken fried steak, grilled bacon steak and eggs, and pulled pork waffles. One entree on its own is $13 but for $20 you can include a bottomless bellini, mimosa, or bloody mary! That's a steal compared to many Vegas brunch deals.\n\nThe dishes look deceptively portioned. I thought I would be able to finish mine but had enough leftovers for a whole meal! The smokehouse hash was nicely seasoned though the toast was a bit burnt. My friend got the pulled pork waffles and man was the meat tender. The waffle was fluffy as well but the star of the show was that bourbon aged maple syrup...So good.\n\nThe drinks were standard but definitely didn't taste super cheap. The bellini was way sweet and the mimosa was nicely balanced.\n\nService was quick and our waiter was very friendly and seemed to genuinely love the food he was serving! Decor is cute and seemed like a modern country home, with brick walls, tall windows, and even a mason jar chandelier. \n\nI would definitely come back again! Its location being Townsquare makes it great as well so you can walk around afterwards to sober up. Don't drink and drive!"

We ordered a full rack of spareribs and baby back ribs and the moment the plate arrived, we knew that we were in for something special.  Amazing quality and quantity...honestly, I've never seen so much meat on a rib before and I'd swear that we were each given several pounds of pure meat.  This is the first time I have not been able to finish my \"rack\" of anything on the first sitting...not even close, I brought half of the ribs home.\n\nMuch like the meat, the side dishes were incredible.  My wife had sweet potatoes that were plentiful and topped with marshmellow and the report was \"best I've ever had\".  We both had excellent green beans.  And the Mac & Cheese...wow...honestly the best I've ever had...large and cheesy and creamy.\n\nWe eat 99.5% of our meals out and it's not often that we're pleasantly surprised by a new restaurant.  Well, our hat is of to Pot Liquor CAS.  We've already settled on the fact that the next time we feel like BBQ...this is the place!"

Our waitress was Amazing and definitely had the spirit of the south down with her southern charm. The staff was friendly and jovial with their interaction with my family.

They offered to substitute pulled pork, which I accepted. I (semi) jokingly said since I couldn't get pork belly, my brisket should be extra barky, my favorite part. Upon getting my order (very promptly,) I was stunned to see an enormous serving of pulled pork. I expected a couple of spoonfuls on top of the grits. I also had the most bark I've ever had on a brisket, including an end piece. The grits were wonderful, as usual, and the cornbread & honey butter was so good that I couldn't even make it to the key lime pie dessert. I've got so much leftover that I'll be enjoying it the entire week. Kudos to the manager Drea for taking exceptionally good care with my order, in addition to offering me a tour of the smoking process on my next visit!"

We must have been there on the most OFF night they have ever had or just don't understand this kind of BBQ.  Starting w/ the apps \"burnt ends\" more like med well chunks of meat cooked, not burnt at all not crispy, deviled eggs tasted like plain hard boiled eggs- I salted them! All the sauces....left lil to be desired. I am astonished so many people liked this place because everything we had from apps to dessert was gross, dry, cooked wrong and just completely opposite of all the reviews here and on other sites we had seen prior to coming.  1 star for the juicy tender 1/2 chicken dish, but the green bean side wasn't good until we got to the bottom of the dish were all the garlic flavoring they were tossed in laid.  Baby back ribs looked and tasted like spare ribs. 3 orders of Mac n cheese later we were sooo disappointed; didn't look like any pics posted and was dry and not CHEESY...tasted just like cooked macaroni not \" macaroni & CHEESE.\"  Burger was supposed to be med. cooked and it came out red and bloody; I didn't send it back.  Service was friendly, but poor.  The waiter was behind on drink orders and bumping in to everyone- having a casual dinning atmosphere is one thing, but when the waiter is pulling plates from you before your done eating (even though we were) and just reaching over to grab things...yikes.  Since it was a birthday the waiter suggested the bread pudding for dessert as if he was comping a birthday dessert. Not only did we get charged for it!! but it was so dry and boring.  I even saw a family leaving outside the entrance and they had the same bewildered grossed out look on their face I had through out the meal as we sampled everything.  I stopped to ask them how it was and they said \"OK, the chili was good, but the ribs were not what they expected and not baby back!\"  We agreed...YIKES! \nI am sorry this is the first review I have wrote and I am sorry it's bad but all 6 of us won't be retuning.  We love BBQ and this was just not the place for us.  The dogs were happy! Since we brought home 4 to go boxes of ribs and chicken :/ Sorry guys I don't know what happened, but it was bad."

YOU WANT LOCAL BBQ...Rolling smoke in an industrial area. So if your a tourist, go during daylight hours.

We went there on a Friday around lunchtime and the place only had couple tables to start. We were greeted by the hostess and we asked to see the menu first before deciding whether to eat here or not. The menu looked very appealing so we got a table. \n\nThe decoration inside was clean, appealing and very nice. Our server was very friendly and prompt. So why did I give this a 1 star?\n\nWe ordered off the lunch menu. DH got the T.L.B \"Tender Loving Bacon\" (10.95) and I got the Shrimp Po' Boy (13.95). And we ordered the appetizer Pork Belly With Country Grits (9.95).  (See the pictures I posted)\n\nThe App came out in a decent amount of time, it was only 2 pieces of pork belly on top of some grits, the presentation is nice and the flavors were ok. But come on, it is not worth $9.95 price tag. Before we were done with our app the entrees came out. DH's T.L.B is a joke, size wise, it's like 4 bites and with 2 pieces of bacon and they call it a BLT and charge $10.95 for it?? It probably only cost them $2 at the most to make this at this portion. \n\nMy Po' Boy was decently sized, I got few pieces of large shrimp in mine. The flavor however is lacking. No seasoning whatsoever and the shrimp had a heavy shrimp smell to it (it wasn't very fresh). Both dishes came with a side of cole slaw and fries. The cole slaw did not have flavor, only a touch of vinegar. We both only ate one bite of it and that's it. The fries were good, crunchy and fresh out of the fryer.\n\nOverall, the food just did not live up to the description on the menu and it's way too overpriced. I know this location must have a high overhead but you cannot charge $10.95 for a kid's sized sandwich."

Almost like an identity crisis that somehow works. The service was friendly but SLOW. For BBQ which has already been smoked, it should come out quickly! We were seated at 6:05 pm and our check was also slow in coming out, finally arrived around 8:30 pm! Most of the time was spent waiting for the food or check. We ate quickly because we had two kids in tow. They also never brought out those warm wet washcloths to wipe your hands, so I had to wash my hands to get the BBQ sauce off of my hands.\nThat being said, the ribs were meaty and delicious with a subtle hint of smoke. The sweet sauce was good, but the vinegar sauce was too astringent. The fries weren't great (luke warm and hard) but the Alabama sauce was really good. The succotash was ok, they used corn cut off the cob. Pulled pork was standard. The burnt ends were a little tough, but came with local pickles (cool) and Wonder bread-type bread slices. Why?? My five-year-old son complained about the mac and cheese; I tasted it wondering what could be wrong with mac and cheese, and it was suspiciously Velveeta-esque. Overall, their meat was good quality, but they skimped on some of the sides.\nLucille's is better and worth the extra drive, unless you just want a trendy place to hang out."

The ribs were\nNot cooked properly and were  still on the raw side. We wanted to order their crab appetizer but they said they were out, so were ordered their hummus and prawns. Prawns had no taste. Hummus was ok, nothing special to rave about   After I tried ordering a sandwich and told I could only have it for lunch we got annoyed and left.

Go figure. \n\nThe first time I went here was after a watching a movie at AMC for a Yelp CME. They offered happy hours prices. That night I enjoyed a beer and tasted their moinks, a wrapped meatball with a tangy sauce. I enjoyed the atmosphere as many BBQ joints seem to  follow the rule of having white and red checkered everything with a super country atmosphere. This restaurant has been paying attention to Pinterest trends with their decor. \n\nThe second time I went was after seeing a show at the Baobab with a very large group. They were able to accommodate us and they were really cool about it too. The waitress made sure to take our orders based on where we were sitting, and then she effortlessly split the checks for us. I don't think I have had such a smooth large group dinner in my life. \n\nFor this second time, I had not eaten dinner and I had two drinks during the show, so I figured I better get a bite. I saw the descriptions of their full menu items and figured the portions would be huge, so I turned to the appetizer menu. After speaking with the waitress and based on recommendations, I went with the pork belly on the country grits. I have been on a pork belly kick lately and I really enjoyed the dish. The grits were cheesy and the reduction type sauce they drizzled brought it together. I will say that the dish is best eaten hot, as I started talking too much and I let the rest of my food got cold. There is simply too much fat in this dish between the cheese and the fat from the pork belly that starts to congeal if you let it sit. So scarf it quick. \n\nOverall I was impressed with the service. I think that if you are in the mood for BBQ with a smidge of class, this is the place."

This must be a great place. So off we went to dinner with another couple with grand visions of a fabulous meal to come. This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion. I gave this place a one star rating because the cornbread muffin was just ok and the water was wet! We eat out often and I've not ever felt so used and cheated."

Each time there was a wait to get a seat even though when you sat down there were tons of open tables. These were not tables that had been used, they were just sitting vacant for 10-15 minutes until someone who was waiting got seated. \n\nThen once finally seated, it would be 5-10 minutes before you were greeted by the service staff. They would greet you and take your drink order, don't worry about being rushed as it would be another 10-15 before you saw your waiter again. No water, no drink, no service. \n\nAfter you order you can't drink too fast as you won't see a waiter or anyone to refill your water until your food arrives. \n\nOnce the food does actually come, it is tasty and a good value for the price. This is why I gave the place so many shots to be good. Sadly it's just not. \n\nAdvice, go here but order takeout. It will be a much better experience, I think."

A $35 combo platter that included pulled pork, hot links, two kinds of ribs, and two sides was enough for 2 and there were even leftovers.  The collard greens were pretty good - better than average.  The yams were OK, but nothing special.  The ribs were a little dry, but they had a couple of sauces on the side.  The pulled pork was not really as flavorful and was pretty pulverized and greasy.  I prefer my pulled pork a little more chunky than this.  Still it's one of the only BBQ places in Town Square.  I give it an A-OK three star rating and I would have given it a 4 star if they had included any bread in the platter.  Oh I could have used up one of my vegetable sides to get cornbread, but that's just not a good option.  A BBQ meal should come with some bread even if it's just a biscuit or a roll.  Even a slice of bread would be better than nothing.  It couldn't break you to provide a 25 cent roll on a platter that costs over $30.     Service was good.  A little slow to get the food, but really friendly and nice.  \n\nWeird things about the bar though - I sort of wonder if there is an escort service operating out of there.  It seems like there are pretty blondes hanging at the bar constantly on their cell phones, never ordering drinks or meals.  Just hanging out coming and going whenever the phone rings.  Someone should look into that."

This review is based off the lunch menu and none of the BBQ entrees.\n\nBasically, this place is still in their \"soft opening\". We were greeted by the owner who was very polite and gracious and even gave us his business cards so we could personally message him if needed.\n\nThe hostesses, our server, and the bajllion other people that came to our table to fill our drinks, clear silverware, etc, were all fantastic and really on top of their shit. Obviously, since they just opened everyone is going to try their best, but I have to hand it to the staff, they did a really phenomenal job.\n\nSo with that said, sadly, I was not quite a fan of the food here.\n\nThe appetizers we ordered were the chicken wings, baked blue crab, and the burnt ends. Everyone agreed the chicken wings were meh; good texture but lacking in flavor. The dipping sauce they were served with was nice I personally enjoyed the baked blue crab, it was my favorite thing I tried. The burnt ends were actually meaty pieces, but lacked flavors you would expect if the meat was actually being cooked all day as they claimed.\n\nAgain, I did not try any of the bbq meat entrees. All of us got something off the lunch menu, which is actually moderately priced for the amount of food you get. I ended up getting a chicken sandwich with a large portion of sweet potato fries. The chicken was bland (yeah I know, I got it grilled, but I expected a little more) and my sweet potato fries were cold when the plate was set down in front of me. This is also the kind of place where if you ask for a sauce, you get a tiny half filled metal cup. Slightly annoying, but not a big deal. \n\nMy coworkers opininons were mixed, but the general consensus was that they could definitely do something to up the flavors. 2 of my coworkers got the pulled pork sandwich, which did not come with sauce and didn't really have much flavor. The meals people got around us all looked tasty (the BBQ entrees/sides), which is a reason a few of us would want to go back. \n\nIt's a nice little place to get BBQ if you happen to be in Town Square. The lunch menu is worth giving a try. I may go back in a month or so to try something else off their menu."

Described by director of development Flip Arbelaez as a 'fusion' of styles, both in food and d\u00e9cor, with design concepts ranging from reclaimed barn wood and mason jar chandeliers to a slick marble bar at the restaurant center the majority of our meal at Pot Liquor CAS was paired to sounds far more 'urban' than Southern but looking squarely at the 'cue from a tightly regulated indoor smoker burning a blend of woods low-and-slow at 250\u00b0F there was nothing at all to suggest the cuisine to be that of some city-slicker.  Unfortunately sold out of the pulled pork given our late hour of arrival and additionally limited on desserts which, save for a few, are not yet available it was with a focus on the remaining variety of smoked meats that our order was crafted and with our server literally cheering us on in phrases like \"yeah, I like that\" or \"that's totally what I'd do\" it was not long before our order arrived, a single appetizer of crisp but under-seasoned pork belly over buttery ground corn plus a large pair of plates featuring more than enough meat and sides to be shared.  Beginning first with tender sliced beef featuring a substantial waft of smoke but otherwise seasoned in only salt and pepper I'm confident in saying that Pot Liquor already offers the best brisket in Sin City and moving onward to snappy house-made hot links that paired beautifully with the mayonnaise and horseradish white sauce I was again impressed, the somewhat dry spare ribs a small step in the wrong direction though falling-from-the-bone baby backs were a return to form and easily on par with Rollin' Smoke, though commanding nearly twice the price even without accounting for the AYCE option at the longstanding Vegas favorite.  A bit underwhelmed by sides, particularly the skimpy portion of cornbread that commands a $5.95 menu price, it was in a duo of the three available desserts that we rounded out the night and with each option carrying a $6 pricetag the brownie-beneath-a-croissant style bread pudding proved unquestionably a must order, the nearly molten chocolate base well suited to blend nicely with slowly melting ice cream rife in vanilla amidst ample amounts of butter.\n\nClearly more corporate than the traditional Southern Smokehouse yet innovative in their scientific approach to barbeque with a controlled temperature in-house smoker it will be interesting to see just how Las Vegans respond to Pot Liquor CAS, the high tariff likely to turn some away in a city where good barbeque is sorely underrepresented and many seem satisfied by the swill being turned out by Famous Dave's at less than half the price.  With everything made in-house including brines, bacon, hot links, and a wide array of sauces it should go without saying that these guys are dedicated to what they do and with a high likelihood to only improve with time and customer feedback I look forward to a return visit sometime before year's end - hopefully to find the 'cue consistent, if not bettered by a well seasoned smoker, with sides and the music turned down...or at least tuned to something more befitting the sort of cuisine being served."

Their official opening is supposed to be around the 8th or 9th of October.  \n\nSat at the bar and the staff was very quick to get me my drink order.  Nice to see fresh lemonade with free refills.  I took my time perusing the menu so the bartender suggested a plate of pork rinds while I made my decision.  Tasty, warm, and with a touch of lime-salt.  Being Filipino, I prefer to have a little meat on my pork rinds, not just the skin.  But that's a personal bias I won't let influence this review.\n\nDecided on the half-order dry rubbed ribs with green beans and the cornbread muffins.  The green beans were crisp-tender and very well seasoned.  The corn muffins (3 half-sized ones) were good with a very good honey butter on the side.\n\nThe ribs are very good here!  Very flavorful dry rub and the meat was falling off the bone tender.  The two 'que sauces were served on the side: 1 was smoky, 2 had a little more heat.  Nice that they give you both and you can always order more.  A nice touch is that the ribs come to the table individually sliced.  Sometimes you don't feel like fighting your meat, even if you have a knife in your hand!  \n\nSome reviews complained about the wait.  Can't comment on the wait 'cause I was watching football and I usually lose all track of time when I'm watching football.  \n\nI liked the atmosphere here.  Cool black and white photos, unique saxophone chandelier, and classic rock playing in the background.  The staff was very attentive and one of the owners and the assistant manager came by, introduced themselves, and asked about the experience.  \n\nThe only gripe I had was about the dessert.  I haven't had a good fried pie in a long time and was happy to see it on the menu.  But....duh..duh..duhhhhhhh......they didn't have any.  WHAAAAATTTT?!  Nope.  My bartender told me it would be on the menu by the time they had their official opening....(sniff, sniff)....  One of the tragedies of eating at a restaurant during their soft opening.  I usually like soft openings too...but I digress\n\nOverall a very good experience.  I'll definitely be back to try other dishes...and to try their deep fried pies."

They have the coolest chandeliers...two made of mason jars and one made of saxophones and other musical instruments. \nThe menu has tons of appealing options but a girl can only eat so much so will have to go back to try more.  For starters we had the devil'd eggs with chicken skin cracklin (hugely yummy) and boiled peanut hummus (excellent). We shared our main and absolutely loved the chicken pot pie and the amazing fries that came with it. We should have tried the white sauce for the fries but will do that next time. We also had the red bliss potato salad and mac and cheese - both were very tasty. They were out of collard greens, boohoo, so will try that next time as well. The shrimp po' boy was good but we much preferred the chicken pot pie. With just opening, everything can't be perfect right out of the gate.\nFor dessert we had the strawberry shortcake sandwiches and my dining pals all love it. I'm allergic to strawberries so sadly had to pass. I really wanted to try the fried banana split with the strawberry compote on the side but they are not serving that just yet. Other stand outs on the menu that sound amazing but we did not yet try are pan seared stripe bass, fried green tomato salad, pork belly with country grits, fried catfish benedict and baked blue crab. I'm not a red meat eater but will be bringing my husband back to try. \nThe smell was heavenly and overall loved, loved, loved it. The servers were friendly and efficient. The alcoholic drink menu looked really good but will have to try that next time as well. This place is only going to get better and it's really great now. Definitely worth checking out."

Let me tell you, Pot Liquor CAS is my favorite. If you're thinking for that authentic BBQ experience (styrofoam boxes, lard and plastic checkerboard table cloth) than Pot Liquor won't be your place. If you're looking for a BBQ place that is a little fancier Pot Liquor is your place. \nPark near the movie theaters in Town Square and the place is right next door. The restaurant has been empty the times I've been (weeknights, weekends) so no need for a reservation. \nWhats the Deal with the Chicken and the Beef: It comes with brisket, pulled pork and chicken. 2 corn breads are included and you get a choice of 2 sides. The pulled pork and brisket were AMAZING. The chicken was a little dry. The corn bread and honey butter were so good, that I wouldn't be against ordering more corn bread for your side ;) Collared greens were good, but if I'm going to eat my vegetables I want them to be in a more healthy form. Mac N Cheese and french fries were both good. \nIf you're looking for a dress up for dinner BBQ place come to pot liquor. If you're looking for a BBQ place you can go to in sweats, skip it."

It wasn't very full and seemed like it wasn't very busy as we got a seat right away.  15 minutes later we were still sitting there waiting.  Not even acknowledged at this point.  So we ask the hostess to let our server know we were here so they could at lease get us some water.   She returns with water (not our server).  At this point the family sitting next to us leans over and tells us to \"make sure you order your drinks and food all together once your server gets here because you'll never see him again\"\n\nMakes me feel awesome right? 5 minutes or so later server shows up.  Now I'm very understanding when a place gets busy, or is short handed.  I'll give any place the benefit of the doubt, but when server showed up he doesn't offer an apology, or explanation, and quickly asks what we want and speaks to us as if we've been friends for years.  \n\nRibs were pretty damn good.  Good smoke flavor, very tender.  All the sides were mediocre at best.  Sweet tea tasted off.  We managed to get the tea switched to water quickly...but did not receive any refills (or offer to refill) at any point in the meal until we were ready to leave.  \n\nA gentleman who we assumed was the manager ended up getting our bill for us. He was very polite.  So for him and the ribs I'll give 2 stars. \n\nGood ribs, I'm sure some of the other meats are good, but the service is definitely lacking.  Not worth a second shot with better BBQ places in Vegas."

I booked our reservation that morning and when we arrived it wasn't there, something about the system not syncing on same day reservations, whatever, I understand and we waited about 10mins and stared at the empty restaurant until we were seated.  Once seated we waited about 20 mins for someone to take our drink order, when she finally came over she apologized profusely and told us she didn't know that she had this section either, she mentioned that she looked at us \"100 times\" and had no idea.  THERE'S MY ISSUE.  I've worked in the service industry before, and the restaurant I worked at you always greeted a table regardless if it's yours or not if you see them waiting there.  This whole \"your section\" \"my section\" game is completely ridiculous when you see several tables not being helped and then admit to it.  \n\nI had the pulled pork and waffles, it was really good and a nice change to the typical chicken and waffle.  I like the bottomless mac and cheese for the kids because that's currently the only food group my kids will eat.\n\nThe head host did give us a complimentary drink ticket for the wait.  And I do have to compliment the busser who was pouring water for everyone that morning.  He was the only person who ever checked on us while no one was getting our order and I made it a point to pull him to the side and tip him directly because he deserved it.  Had we not had that water we probably would have left like the table next to us did."

We were quickly greeted by our server and she got our drink orders. 10 minutes went by for a Moscow Mule-no biggie it happens. She got our food order which was a dip and shredded pork sandwich and we never saw her again. Our food took 30 minutes which, whatever, it happens maybe she got caught up? We never got our waters refilled or checked in on at all. Water is like Serving 101 and it's vegas. Our food came when the food runner dropped it off, informed us they didn't have ketchup when we asked.. and we never saw our server. She came by at the very end to collect extra plates from the middle of the table out of the way. Not our food plates, as in extra plates that weren't used. Never asked us how our food was, never asked if I wanted a refill on my drink or gave us any water refills. Weird.  We asked for the check and it took another 10. This place is so cool and the food is good but the service was bad :( we were disappointed.  Dang."

When I sat down, I thought I was going to be going with the $12 pulled pork sandwich but it turned into a $140 mega-feast among the 3 of us hungry men! \n\nAppetizer 1: We started off with the pork rinds. I never buy pork rinds and would never have ordered them. My amigo that was with us placed the order and I'm so glad he did. They were amazing. Best id ever had (to the tenth power). They came out of the kitchen crackling... Talk about fresh! Perfectly seasoned. If you think you would like pork rinds, you haven't tried them until you've had them there. \n\nAppetizer 2: Burnt ends. Absolutely delicious. Tender, perfect amount of fat, brown sugar rub that wasn't too sweet... I expect all BBQ joints to have these as their signature and Pot Liquor did it right. \n\nEntree: We shared a platter that included hot links, dry rubbed spare ribs, baby back ribs, pulled pork, half chicken, and got a side of sliced brisket. If I reviewed them all individually, this would turn into a short novel. What I can say is that everything was awesome with the exception of the sliced brisket. It was tender but dry. \n\nFive sauces were offered to us including one that we special ordered that was a habanero barbecue sauce. If you like some (actually a lot of) heat, that one was definitely the way to go. Also offered was a mayonnaise-based sauce for the chicken, vinegar-based, a ketchup based and a sweet baby rays like sauce. \n\nThe service was as best as I've seen. We had Dana. She was incredibly personable and if I ever go back I will definitely request to sit at her table. She told us the story about their found the chef recently passing and how the culture among the work staff is beyond family like. \n\nThere was another guy who ran the food to the table and he was just as great. Periodically check up on us and made sure we had exactly what we needed.\n\nI'm not a beer guy but they had several craft beers that my friends enjoyed. \n\nThis place isn't cheap but you will not be disappointed with your visit. \n\nDefinitely go."

The fries were among the best ever we've had.\n  BUT southren* cooking doesn't have to come with a layer of fat 1/3 thick on smoked brisket. And a body expects the brisket to be tender.  Pot Liquor's dipping and barbecue sauces are unnecessarily inventive--all the barbecue sauces were composed on the same overly - hot base. The mayo-based horseradish/lemon zest sauce was bland and puzzling. We tried a smattering of other traditional southern dishes,  but they were disappointing enough to be unmemorable. Prices were high for the quality.\nService was super friendly and excellent. The store doesn't slam you with loud music.\nMe going back? Nope. Guys might for the sandwich and fries.

First out were the pork rinds, they looked store bought, but I gave them a shot...nope, tasted store bought as well. It felt to me like they just warmed them up and served them. Not impressed. Next out was the pot pie. Not a traditional looking pot pie. It had a lattice  pattern crust just laying on top. The crust was very buttery, so much so it over powered the rest of the flavors in the pie. The veggies were a disappointment as well. Tasted and looked as if they were from a can of veggie medley. \n   Now the good news, a gentleman (who I assume was the manager) came to ask how my meal was and I told him. He told me how they were planning to take the pot pie off the menu for some of the reasons I had described and replaced my pork rinds with the Grilled Bacon appetizer. Now that was amazing! Think cut bacon steaks with a jalape\u00f1o jelly that had just the right kick and a slaw of pickled cucumbers and carrots. That made up for my entire meal. And the fact the management was concerned enough to ask about my meal because he didn't see me touching the pork rinds let me know they care about their food.

Our server was super attentive and on top of his game, kept our drinks fresh and our table clear. They make their own pickles and he graciously brought more when we asked. Speaking of gracious, the head chef visited each table and when he stopped and chatted at ours we mentioned the fried green tomatoes (we'd already shared the generous portion of burnt ends with 4 different sauces - note, the white sauce was a huge hit!). He remarked how great they were and said hang on, I'll bring some out, on the house. Trust me, they are perfectly prepared and absolutely yummie! For entrees, two of us ordered the full rack of dry rub ribs. Believe me when I say that one order is enough for 4 people!! I love ribs and can honestly say that I have never eaten them without sauce until last night. Their rub is ideal and so savory that putting sauce on them would be a sin. The others had brisket, pulled pork and skirt steak (super tender) and oxtail ragu over rice. Everyone raved over their meal and sides. We're already planning our next trip. Mine will be the mopped baby back ribs..."

Came on a Sunday night and the restaurant was extremely empty, but the restaurant is so cute! With the lights and the brick and wood walls. I loved it! We started with a Caesar salad and the deviled eggs. Was so good! The crispy chicken skin on top of the eggs were a great touch! The platters are big enough to share so then it made the visit worth it. We got the chicken, beef and hog platter. The brisket was a little dried for me but was still good. And we still had enough to bring home leftovers. Matt was our server and he was awesome!!"

I wish someone would ever tell me they didn't like the ribs here. \nReasons why; 1)you don't need the sauce. Even know the sauce is real deal Holyfield, made from scratch. You would feel conflicted \n2)ask the chef to see the smoker. Holy grail. \n3)SIDES! Anybody could grease up or fry up some decent side dishes. Treat yourself to some veggies. I'm suggesting green beans. (I didn't get the opportunity to try the collard greens.)"

The chicken was good, but not served with barbecue sauce?  The chili was good but nothing special or southern happening there either. The Pork Sliders were very good...nice rolls with good slaw, but very little barbecue sauce. Nothing to compare to real North Carolina / South Carolina / Texas barbecue.  \n\nAll and all not bad, but with so many great barbecue places to choose from in LV, I probably won't be back.

I'm not a whiskey drinker, but their whiskey menu seemed pretty extensive. \n\nWe went on a Sunday, and they offer a brunch menu, which includes bottomless mimosas, Bloody Mary, or Bellini's. My hubby opted for the chicken fried steak off of the brunch menu - which he LOVED. So many places use frozen chicken fried steaks, that it's really difficult to get a truly enjoyable CFS, but this is NOT the case here. The steak was fresh, as were the biscuits, gravy and mashed potatoes. It's the first time he has enjoyed a CFS in a REALLY long time. \n\nI got the mopped baby back ribs, collard greens, and corn bread. The ribs were tasty and tender, but there was a little too much rosemary in the sauce for me to truly love them. The collard greens were on point, as were the cornbread and FRESH honey butter. \n\nMy son got the pulled pork waffle, which is a Belgian waffle with a big pile of pulled pork on top of it. The meat was very moist, and the waffle was nice and crispy. \n\nWe also got the crispy pork belly on pur\u00e9ed sweet potatoes, which was TO DIE FOR!  The salty/sweet combo was excellent."

The pulled pork had good moist flavor and texture.  The dry rub spare ribs were dry tough chewy not much flavor. Baby back ribs were an improvement over the dry rub ribs but still a little overdone for my taste. the sides were the real winners in this lunch combo the greens were some of the best I've ever had and the mac and cheese was really very rich and delicious. Was looking forward to the hot link but dry overcooked kind of a funny aftertaste not really much to write home about. As far as Service goes everyone was polite but very low energy and 11 minutes on a cocktail is a bit long of a wait especially when they're not very busy at lunch.  I will have to continue my search for Bbq in Las Vegas as this place just did not cut the mustard."

It was the best salad ever. I hate when dining establishments drown your salad with dressing! We order a salad because we actually like our vegetables!! Geez, let us taste them. Pot Liquor had just enough Lemon Caper Olive Oil Dressing to enhance the flavor and allow the true flavors of ham, red onion, goat cheese and those beautiful Green Tomatoes that were battered in something CLEARLY amazing-now I have a run-on sentence!

It's located at Town Square on the NW end right next to valet.\n\nAnyways, my family and I came in on a Sunday WITH reservations. Well I got there 30 minutes late and I was sitting there for awhile and we had to ask the busser to get our server lol. Awful. Did not ask if I wanted something to drink. Did not ask if I wanted to order. Just inattentive. Okay whatever.\n\nSo I ordered the sweet tea and the 8oz brisket with cornbread, Mac n cheese, and collard greens. The tea was great. Tasted freshly brewed and not overly sweet. The cornbread was good, flavorful, mildly sweet. Mac n cheese was BOMB tho. It was cheesy but like soft and cooked right. The greens weren't my cup of tea. I'm really picky about my greens and I like mine cooked in like a chicken broth so to speak. Their green were sour and spicy. No thanks. The brisket was cut into 3 pieces and it was little. Lol. For 20 bucks I get 3 strips of brisket? It's cool man. The sides probably made up the cost of the plate. Anyways. The brisket is mediocre. I think it was a little over cooked or something. It was pretty tough that I almost choked on it even after chewing 100 times. So that was that.\n\nMeal over. We didn't get any refills. We didn't get any boxes. Mind you, it was looking like a complete ghost town in the restaurant. There was literally only 2 other tables besides us. Now I can totally understand if our server was also the cook, but the service definitely needs a big bit of adjustment. They didn't add automatic gratuity to our check but we gave him the 18% anyway, even tho he only deserved 10%. Lmao."

            "review": "So I have been here several times since its grand opening earlier this year and I can honestly now say that this BBQ rivals the best in town (John Mull's Roadkill Grill). That's solely based on the standard BBQ fare though, because in all honesty, both restaurants are in a class of their own. \n\nPot Liquor CAS (\"Contemporary American Smokehouse\") is exactly like the name proclaims. It is a contemporary take on the Southern food we all know and love. Contemporary seems to be associated with overpriced menu items, that you can usually get for a fraction of the price elsewhere, or by strange menu items that take the original food item and completely transform them until they are unrecognizable (a la \"Chopped\" Basket Cooking). So much to my surprise, I was blown away when I came to Pot Liquor to find out that not only are the prices very reasonable, but they include (and actually exceed my expectation) of standard BBQ fare. That's not to say they don't have some creative spins on the classics (i.e. Oxtail chili) or that they don't have expensive items (i.e. Pappy Van Winkle that can run you almost $160 a glass for this extremely rare bourbon). But boy, oh, boy do they deliver on everything they do here.\n\nThe menu for the food, with the kitchen ran by Chef Doug Bell, as well as, the drink menu seems to consistently add new, and interesting, items to the menu every time I have had a chance to stop in there for Dinner. Here are a few highlights from my trips there:\n\nAppetizers\n\n- Classic: Burnt Ends and Devil'd Eggs - The Burnt Ends are a must-have at this location. \n\nAs for the Devil'd Eggs, I am not usually the first one jumping out of my seat when these are offered at a cocktail party, but damn, these are some of the greatest things I have ever put in my mouth. The cracklin bacon bits sprinkled on top just send this item into another world.\n\n- Contemporary: Bacon Steak and Stuffed Trotters - The Bacon Steak is a newly added item that probably takes 1st place over anything that I have had here. You get the crispy bacon sear on the outside like you would expect from a piece of bacon with your morning eggs, but the inside is pure, ooey-gooey pork belly richness. It is complemented with a side of some of the hottest, pickled pepper relish I have ever had. This dish is very reminiscent of a Vietnamese Bahn Mi sandwich done Southern.\n\nThe Stuffed Trotters are a unique item that I have never seen before. They take pig's feet (a Southern tradition) and grind it into almost a Pig's Feet Chicken Nugget. It is complemented with an apple compote and arugula salad of sorts that pairs perfectly with the juicy Pig McFugget.\n\nEntrees\n\nTo be honest, I always get the \"Lord Have Mercy\" when I come here because I usually come in a group of 3 or more. It is perfect and definitely will fill a group of 5 or 6 easily. Comes with basically all the meats on the menu (does not include blood sausage, but I have substituted the Hot Links with them once), along with 3 sides and all their specialty sauces. All this for under $60!!! After you try their Baby Back Ribs or the Spare Ribs, you will probably never want to have ribs from another BBQ joint in town again. The pulled pork is perfect with their vinegar based sauce, as well. \n\nDrinks/Desserts\n\nAll of their special Lemonade cocktails are out of bounds amazing. You really can't go wrong with any of these. They also offer a wide selection of beers/ciders and an extensive whisky/bourbon selection (as mentioned above).\n\nMy favorite dessert so far has been the Fried Pies, which they change up with whatever is most in season. I recently had the Fried Pie filled with Kumquat which was probably the best dessert I have ever had. Tasted like good ol orange marmalade stuffed into a pie with a creamy vanilla sauce over the top. I believe the current Fried Pie is pecan which is like a Pecan Pie Hot Pocket. Which is.. fantastic!\n\nGive yourself some time to truly enjoy this great addition to the Las Vegas food scene. It is located directly across from Yardhouse, so if you are feeling like you need a little more whisky than beer one night, then do yourself a favor and check out Pot Liquor!"

Walking in the hostess was very nice, seated us promptly and offered for us to park our stroller up front. \nIt wasn't very busy, maybe 4 other tables with guests. Server greeted us, took the drink order and went over her suggestions on the menu. We took her suggestion and ordered the pork belly. It was delicious \nWe then ordered the combo with brisket, chicken and pork to share. Green beans and fries with white sauce on the side. I was pretty excited the sauce was gluten free, but quickly let down when it was cold as though it came out of the fridge. I was even more disappointed that most of our food was room temperature, and all the sauces were cold. Who likes dipping luke warm food in cold sauce? The meat was pretty good, the chicken literally fell off the bone. The green beans weren't trimmed, which was really annoying. For a $60 dinner, I don't want to have to trim my own green beans (which were under cooked), and eat cold food. \nThe waitress was great, very personable and friendly. She's really the only reason I didn't give it less stars.

And can't forget the sweet butter w/ corn bread. All combo are 25- 35$. You get quite a bit of food. And it's good. My waiter did have to be reminded at times but he still got a decent tip.

The manager both times is easy to spot, as he's making sure the place runs smoothly in these opening weeks.\n\nSkirt Steak w/Oxtail Ragu: Steak was cooked correctly to order, a hint of marinade that had some distinctiveness but might've been lacking in a salt-ish flavor.  The ragu was an interesting compliment, but didn't exactly jump out for all its billing.\n\nDry Rub Ribs: A half order is still quite a generous portion of seven medium sized ribs with one end piece.  A tasty, distinctive rub that meshed well with the rib's juices.  The end piece though was tough like pork jerky.  Kale and cashew slaw is quite unique and tasty.  Fries were not.  Good value though with the promotion.\n\nWould've appreciated some more napkins and wet naps once the food was served, but was eventually given a hot towel toward the end of the meal.\n\nPlace is off to a good start from the times I went.  Does blow the doors off the chain BBQ joints in LV, and thank goodness for that."

Chicken wings with mac and cheese was what I got and my boyfriend got the pulled pork sliders with cornbread, he wasn't impressed with either dishes.\n\nThe tables next to us were extremely irritated with how long our server took to give them their checks, napkins, or even pay any attention to them! Our server claims she had a large table that was keeping her from going to our tables which is understandable but then this is where the manager needs to step in and help. He literally came to all our tables when it was too late and when we had to flag down bussers and other servers for things we needed. Although the staff was really friendly they were just too slow and there were so many times where we wanted to just walk out and see if they would even notice. Our corner of the restaurant was completely neglected by any sort of staff member.\n\nIf you want quick service here it looks like the bar would be your best bet and also don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free app or cocktail!"

And their moinks at Stoney's (they have a booth with limited menu), again tasty. So I gave it a try for lunch. \n\nWe got there before 12, trying to beat the lunch crowd. It took 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. We finally got our drinks and put in our order. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nFood quality, I ordered the Cobb salad (~$15).  Served with chicken, blue cheese, avocado, tomatoes, onion, egg, etc. and tossed with a bbq ranch dressing. All things I like. The lettuce seemed to be a combination of spring lettuce and romaine. I can't say for sure if it was the dressing (which was tossed into the salad) or the chicken seasoning, but this salad had the weirdest taste and I really didn't like it.  This complaint was a bit different for me, as my complaint with salads is due to lack of toppings or lack of freshness of toppings- never because of flavor. I actually couldn't eat it and ate half of someone's else's sandwich. \n\nThe other item ordered was the brisket sandwich (~$10) served w bbq aujus served with fried. This was actually really good and would be the only reason I go back. \n\nService: once we got our drinks the service was good throughout the meal. The waitress wasn't in a hurry to bring the check tho. In all, the meal took us about an hour, which was not due to chit chat. \n\nPrice: expect to pay $10-20 per plate for lunch and $15-30 for dinner. A bowl of chili will run $16. Salads $15-20. Meat plates $20+. \n\nBottom line: You can find better bbq elsewhere for a lot less. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else in town square for food (dare I say Texas de Brazil) and eat bbq at Rollin Smoke or John Mulls for a fraction of the price."

Two of us are avid backyard pitmasters ourselves, so when he suggested Pot Liquor, I was game to see what he was all joyous about. \n\nI will say that my experience here rates a 5 based on a combination of atmosphere, service,  and good food.  \n\nThe restaurant, as I eluded, is not your typical bbq joint, and I have visited my share in Kansas City, Texas, Memphis, and Arkansas, as well as Nevada.  It was in fact very hipster and had a unique vibe with the staff, young and spirited.  The restaurant was also very clean and comfortable. \n\nThe restaurant hosted a decent selection of craft and domestic beers, as well as a fully stocked bar.  \n\nOur waitress, Dani, was hip and cool.  She was so helpful to us as we attempted to make our selections.  In fact, not knowing the menu, we almost ordered three separate selections just to get a sampling of everything.  Now, Dani could have taken our money, let us order way to much food, and sent us off fat and happy, just making money for the venue, however, Dani stopped us, gave us her honest opinion on what our best bet was and saved us probably $60!  To me that is service. \n\nNow, the food.  For appetizers, we went with pork skins and burnt ends.  Now, I am not a big pork skin fan, but these things came out smelling awesome AND crackling.  They were delicious! The burnt ends were good, in my opinion, cut a little large, but very tender and flavorful.  The sides, we chose were the greens, mac and cheese, and candied yams.  These were all very tasteful, however, I tried not to dig into them to much, because I was saving room for the meat!. \n\nThe main dishes consisted of sliced brisket, baby back pork ribs, beef spare ribs, Carolina style pulled pork, smoked sausage, and a 1/2 chicken. \n\nI could write a book going over each meat, so I will just say that I was not disapointed in what this hipster bbq joint turned out.  My favorite by far were the beef spare ribs, which is suprising because I am a baby back pork rib fan anyday of the week.  But these beef spare ribs were tender and juicy, with a really great seasoning.  I was also glad that they were served dry. \n\nFinally, if you are concerned about sauces, they brought out a tray of various kinds, but if you want heat, you have to ask for it.  Their habanero sauce was reported to be 8 out of 10, and it definitely lived up to it! It was hot though, without overpowering the meat. \n\nAll in all, I would suggest any bbq aficionado to check out Pot Liquor.  The prices are a little higher, so I would not suggest it for a large family with kids, who aren't going to be eating much, unless you just want to splurge. \n\n*on a final note, we learned one of the two chefs who started Pot Liquor had just passed away.  Dani shared this with us and she became very moved.  I could tell and I told her that I felt they are very family oriented and she quickly said this was a second family to her, and it definitly showed."

The menu sounds so good. I love the concept of a modern smokehouse. There's so much potential for merging traditional dishes with a modern twist no Southern fare and at least with the pork belly and country grits they succeed. With the pork's well caramelized, crispy exterior, rendered fat underneath, and tender meat below that, it's an excellent dish that balances sweet and savory extremely well.\n\nUnfortunately, the other stuff I tried wasn't as good. The mopped baby back ribs were not good at all. I liked the tangy sauce with hints of sweetness but the meat was anything but tender, as if they were cooked much earlier in the day and reheated for my order. I also wasn't a fan of the cake-textured cornbread. The kale and cashew slaw was the lone saving grace to an otherwise awful platter.\n\nThere is a kids menu. My son ordered the chicken fingers, which were way over salted. At least the fries were good."

This type of service is not acceptable here in This town. My reservation was for 7:00pm party of 8 on Sunday June 21, 2015 Last Name Scott!!!"

Was a bit disappointed, at first, with the waitstaff as, while  he acknowledged us when we got there,  he walked by several times afterward as if we weren't there.  The night was saved by the Assistant General Manager David. He made sure we were taken care of and recommended menu items we were more than happy to try.  I tried their Cloud 9 cocktail of vodka,  lemonade and coconut water.  It was refreshing & paired very well with the spareribs is ordered.  My boyfriend had an IPA & the baby back ribs. Both had the dry rub that was very tasty.  I highly recommend  the Hop John & kale & cashew coleslaw as sides.  We will definitely try them again."

The pork belly with grits are the best of each of those I have ever had. The deviled eggs were delicious. The dry rub spare ribs are an absolute MUST ORDER! Oh my goodness. Those slow smoked ribs blew my mind. Also the best I have ever had in my life! The spicy Louisiana hot links were wonderful as was the brisket. The corn bread with sweet honey butter was absurd. I could have eaten that all day. The collard greens in pot liquor were wonderful. The Mac and cheese was delicious, but had trouble in comparison to the ridiculously good corn bread. My whole group was in utter food nirvana. \n\nThey have an extensive beer, whiskey, and bourbon list was pairs beautifully with the food and the decor. This would be a great place for large parties along with a couple wanting a little piece of gorgeous nostalgia. \n\nI am definitely coming back every time I'm in Las Vegas and we're making sure all of our friends and family do the same! Thank you, Pot Liquor, for such an amazing experience!"

Well 4 of us went there at 5;15 this evening, service was ok but we all ordered 1/2 rack of the mopped ribs ( which we have always ordered) They were room temperature and so dry we had to order more BBQ sauce.\nNo one said anything and just ate. We also had 2 drinks each. We are the type of people that would never complain and send food back to the kitchen. We just don't go back to the restaurant. After paying the check I had to tell the waitress how bad the ribs were, she  apologized . They do a Sunday brunch from 11 to 3 and being previous owners of two restaurants we knew they were previously cooked. I also blame the waitress they should know not to serve the food if the quality wasn't right. We will never go back there again.."

Perhaps disappointed is too strong a word...let's just go with underwhelmed.  The Carolina pulled pork missed the mark and dry rub ribs...well let's just say that I always thought the word \"dry\" was supposed to apply to the rub and not the ribs.  And when I asked the staff for some Texas Pete green pepper sauce for my undercooked  collards, they had never heard of it.  On the plus side, the mopped ribs were quite tasty and they did a nice job on the mac and cheese (my favorite vegetable, btw :D ).  The service was friendly and prompt...no complaints there.  Overall, I found the food to be average and over priced.  In hindsight, I should have seen this coming.  No good old-fashioned bbq restaurant should use the word \"Contemporary\" in its name."

We were seated right away, which was awesome because we're used to waiting for a table at the Yard House nearby. The waitress, however, took her sweet time getting to us to just take our drink order. In fact, by the time we told her our drink order, we were already ready to order food, even though she gave us a \"tour of the menu\". \n\nI ordered the shrimp entree, and it was just okay. We also got the burnt ends, the corn fritters and the sliders, so we tried a fair sample of everything. \n\nThe burnt ends were good, but the meat itself was bland without the barbecue sauce. (Something that does not happen at, say, Famous Dave's.) I didn't try the sliders, but my boyfriend told me they had too much coleslaw on them. The creamed corn fritters were definitely the most disappointing. They basically tasted like the outside of a Hot Dog On A Stick, but without any flavor. They were just bland corn balls, which really disappointed me. Again, the dipping sauce is what made them better. I would have liked if the little fried balls could hold their own without being dipped in the \"street corn/chipotle ranch\" sauce they added...\n\nOverall, we spent about $75 for all of our food + tip, and I don't think we'll be returning. For that kind of money, there are far better barbecue places in Vegas."

My wife Lori and I decided to come on a Tuesday because of the 25% off the entire menu and drinks. There was hardly any one there. We were promptly seated and our server Dave came over, he was very cordial and helpful with suggestions.  Before coming there we checked out the menu online and we thought we had a plan on what we were ordering. We both ordered the Pork Belly over grits.  This was one of those dishes that you continually make that mmmmm sound while you're eating. \n\nWe also ordered the deviled eggs which were good also. I ordered the skirt steak over ox tail ragu and Lori stayed from the plan and ordered the Spare Me Baby, which were baby backs, dry rubbed and mopped  spare ribs, that comes with two sides she got the mac and cheese and the fries with Alabama white sauce. When the food came out we were floored at the portion size!  Everything was tasty. My steak was ordered med rare, it was a little tough but manageable. It was served over hoppin johns which were really good. Lori could only eat one baby back and one of the dry rubbed ribs. \nNeedless to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, we were so stuffed and we didn't finish it all. Dave came by smiling and offered to pack it all up for us. Overall the meal was great and we plan to visit again and try some other things on the menu. We also tried one of the lemonades too I had the sidecar and Lori had the cucumber one. They were also very good. \nI highly recommend this place, just make sure you are hungry because the portion sizes are huge and you will be stuffed when you leave."

Not only were we seated immediately, but our server was over within just a few minutes to take our drink order and appetizer order. She kindly suggested a few of their best hits for apps, but we already had our hearts set on the Deviled Eggs and Corn Fritters. I noticed the server was using an iPad and figured it was just a style thing, but when the apps came out piping hot less than five minutes later (and even beating our drinks!) we were really pleasantly surprised. Our server recommended sharing dinner off of the Combination section, so we went with the chicken and baby back ribs accompanied by mac and cheese and hoppin' john - which, again, came out super fast.\n\nThe baby back ribs had a great taste and plenty of meat on the bone, but weren't quite as fall-off-the-bone tender as I've had in other places. The apps and sides were basic and as-ordered, but could use a bit more imagination when it comes to seasoning and flavor. The service was excellent - informative and fast. Prices are a bit high, but considering the location, that's not too surprising. We'll definitely be back to try more on the menu and see if we can find some outstanding items."

And unfortunately, like others have also pointed out, the service is REALLY poor. \n\nMy husband and I have now tried this place for the 5th time since they opened (because we actually do really like the food) but after yet another frustrating experience, I'm sad to say we will not be going back, nor will we be recommending this restaurant to others any longer. \n\nDuring our most recent visit, we came by for a late lunch. There were only 3 other tables of guests in the restaurant, which I attributed mostly to it being an off-time of day, but I couldn't help but thinking others may have had similar experiences to ours in the past and decided to go elsewhere (proven by the packed Yard House we passed on our walk to Pot Liquor). Regardless, we really do love the food so we were excited to give the spot another try, which I soon regretted.\n\nWe arrived 15 minutes before their lunch specials expired (at 3pm) but it was impossible to get any attention from employees who continually walked right past us. Finally, my husband walked back up to the hostess stand to ask if there was a server assigned to our area. (The place is HUGE and actually really nice which just makes their lack of customer appreciation even sadder). She pointed to the gal who had walked passed us a few times without so much as a hello or eye contact and said she'd send her right over. In the meantime, my husband decided to order us 2 drinks from the bar himself, which were made and on their way over to us by the time the server made her 1st appearance. Here's where things get FUN. \n\nWe said we knew what we wanted to order right away, however, when I asked for the Pulled Pork sandwich, she informed me that the lunch menu ended at 3pm so I'd have to either order the pulled pork sliders, or the pulled pork dinner (since it was now 3:06pm). I pointed out to her that we'd been there waiting for quite awhile, and since the ingredients for the meal I was ordering are the same as the others, I was hoping she could ask the kitchen (or the manager, or whoever) if they could make an exception (a 6-minute exception) as I'd prefer the sandwich. She refused, said it wasn't possible, and that I'd have to pick something else. My husband was STARVING by this point so instead of walking out like I wanted to, we quickly picked other items from the dinner menu and decided to try to make the best of it. \n\nUnfortunately, things only got worse as we sat waiting for our food with empty glasses of their yummy alcoholic lemonades (that they easily could have sold us many more of if our server had bothered to come back and offer us another round) and since a food runner was the one who dropped off our meals (or maybe it was another server who didn't bother to ask if we needed anything, like maybe something to wash our food down with) my husband walked up to the bar yet again to ask for a refill on the bottle of water she left on the table for us (by this point I decided we would not be spending one more dollar at this place). \n\nWe didn't see our server again until I flagged her down to bring us our check. As we walked out discussing where we should head to next to have a few cocktails since Pot Liquor definitely wasn't interested in our business, I noticed that one of the three other tables in the restaurant was occupied by what looked to be restaurant management, none of whom had walked over to our table or the other guest table to say hello, thank us for coming in, ask how our experience was, or even notice that the 2 tables of customers in their otherwise empty restaurant were receiving zero attention. Instead they were busy chatting and laughing and working on budgets or menus or some other plans that obviously were missing the main business point they needed to be working on = customer satisfaction and retention."

I was able to sample the Deviled Eggs, which were a little more mustard-y than I prefer (I like mine a bit sweeter), but the cracklins on top were a great touch!\n\nYou could easily make a meal from sampling a few of the appetizer options, and some of our party did. My mom and I decided to be fatties and split the \"Go Hog Wild\" plate, which included dry rubbed spareribs, pulled pork, baby back ribs, and hot links as well as two side dishes (mac & cheese and candied yams). We also got a side of brisket, cause... we just had to! THANK GOODNESS our server let us know that these plates were meant to be shared! \n\nBoth varieties of ribs were very tender, well seasoned and yummy! There were 3 types BBQ sauce served on the side. The brisket wasn't as tender as I like, but it had a good flavor. The hot links had a kick to them, also very good.  The only thing that I didn't like so much was the pulled pork. \n\nThe side dishes were also fantastic. I could eat that mac & cheese every day! \n\nMy only real complaint is that the food is served just warm- I like my meals to be piping hot, but that's just a personal preference. \n\nOne of my friends got the chicken pot pie, which had a puff pastry topping, and that looked really delicious as well- I'll be back to sample that! \n\nWe couldn't leave without trying dessert, so we ordered the brownie bread pudding... AMAZING!!  The perfect balance, not too sweet, and the gelato on top was a great compliment. \n\nThe service was great all around, and the waitress even very kindly split the checks for us. The hostess even took tons of pictures of our group after we finished eating.\n\nI am definitely a fan, and I will be back for more of this liquor!"

But then I started feeling like I was going to throw up and had to run to the bathroom. My partner only took a couple bites of her food then just sat there saying she was full. I knew something was wrong because her favorite dish is Mac and cheese and she had only taken a couple bites of it. We leave and I was really nauseous looking for a place to throw up my meal, Still thinking maybe I ate too much. But then I get home and stayed up all night in the \"bathroom\" getting sick, along with being freezing cold then sweating then back to freezing all night long, I did not sleep and the worst part is we both missed a pay day because we could not go to work. The next morning I am still very sick and my partner comes down stairs and says to me \"we got food poising on your birthday from the Mac and cheese, I'm sorry.\" She said she knew something was wrong after only a couple bites because she started feeling nauseous and swollen. We both ended up missing work due to the fact that we can't leave the house and we got zero sleep last night. Including tip we spent approx $60 to be sick and miss work which in turn cost us 6 times more with lost wages. \n\nIt was really hard to write this review because the staff is some of the nicest people you will encounter from a restaurant."

Unfortunately, there was absolutely no team effort by the rest of the staff. Frankly, I was shocked and so was the nice couple at the next table from myself and my friend. We left Matthew a nice tip...he was a hero and the rest of the staff, wherever they were were zeros . After the meal, when we were waiting for our check, I approached the manager, who had just appeared from the kitchen area, and asked him why our server had six tables and no help. He looked at me like I had two heads..The hostess who was at the podium the entire time, never made an effort to help either. What a difference from restaurants like Lazy Dog, BJs, and Yard House, for example...Always outstanding service by a team dedicated staff. This \"manager\" hasn't a clue..you noticed I haven't even spoke about the food, even though it was very good..Again, 5 stars for Mathew.\nWOW.. Ate there again tonite.. Everything was great.. The food, the service.. Everything.. Thanks Pot Liquor\nMy niece and I were very impressed..5stars all around"

We tried three different appetizers along with our meals. The only item that was worth a damn was the pork belly and grits. The grits were spot on the pork belly not nearly as tender as it should be. The service was mediocre, you could tell the waitresses were more concerned with socializing than refilling our beverages. Same as it goes for the owner more concerned with watching the sports game than noticing his bartender and servers throwing away pints of beer because they don't have the knowledge to allow it to sit or pour it at the proper temperature. It was Thursday at noon and the server informed us they were completely out of coffee. From that moment on our dining experience continued to let us down. I will never recommend this place to anyone and if someone suggests we eat there I'll politely suggest one of the many other restaurants at Town Square. I have a feeling this one will not be around for long."

No problem and we sat down and just relaxed. 20 mins later we began to wonder & were told repeatedly by the hostess it would be just a few more mins. 45 mins later we were sat. Not cool. Be honest or hire competent people who know better. 10 mins later we were finally approached by an overwhelmed waitress. \n\nWe ordered 2 sweet teas and received non sweet teas. Another waiter brought us 2 replacements and once again non sweet teas. We are now an hour into this experience. Third try is a charm, right? Nope not here! Third time and again non sweet teas. By the fourth time we finally got the right teas...\n\nAfter all this I thought to myself, well the food has to be awesome because it can't get worse. First item ordered were deviled eggs. They were dry and the yolk blend didn't even hold to the egg itself. It tasted as if they sat on a counter all day, major fail. Next came the pork sliders, these were great. Then we split some baby back ribs, sweet potato fries and mac & cheese. The ribs weren't tender, the mac & cheese was bland but the fries were very good. Overall pretty mediocre food. I still can't get over the dry deviled eggs :(\n\nWe called a manager over because it was a really shitty experience and the food didn't make up for all the other issues. A nice older French man said all the right stuff and gave us 10% off our order. This is what I call a very poor judgment call. I wasted nearly 2 hours here and have zero interest in ever coming back. Go elsewhere for BBQ. \n\nIf the food was great I could live with the awful service but it wasn't."

I had the Memphis dry rub ribs (which were decent ), Mac-n-cheese(looks good but lacking salt), and \"candied yams(the worst; yams cut up with marshmallows melted on top are not candied yams)\", sweet tea(not sweet)Everything about the meal was blah which sucks cause I really wanted to like this place. As a bbq restaurant it is 5/10 but as a southern restaurant 1/10. Revisit the south and get some new recipes. I don't see how they have gotten 4 of 5 stars on yelp. I wanted to try desert but afraid of being disappointed so I didn't bother."

            "review": "There's a common phrase in Vegas that good barbeque simply doesn't exist here. Lately, more options have been cropping up but I've been careful not to get my hopes up. Pot Liquor has some great things going on, with several varieties of barbeque spanning the country all on one menu.\n\nKANSAS CITY STYLE BURNT ENDS: a small heap of brisket delicacy, served with Pullmans loaf, house-made pickles, and 'cue #1. I liked the tanginess of the sauce, and the variety of ends I received- some pieces tender, some with thick bark, all juicy and flavorful. The pickles and bread were both nice touches, but the ends didn't need them.\nFRIED TOMATO SALAD: I'll admit, I was confused by the dish I received. It wasn't a salad, more of an appetizer, and should be relisted on the menu to reflect that. However, it was good. Five thick, crisp-fried slices with mild goat cheese, spicy red onion, and a complementary dressing. A confident dish where all the ingredients play a specific role.\n\nOne of the managers was nice enough to speak with me for a while- I'll have to return to try the chili of all chilis, his favorite dish. The Sunday brunch offerings are limited but well-priced, inclusive of a bottomless mimosa, bellini, or bloody beverage for $20."

From the moment you walk in the door, you feel like you are in a cozy and relaxing establishment.  The decor is so unique and interesting! From the mason jar chandeliers to the pallet wood bar. The big tables encourage you to bring your family for some fun- which isnt that what having dinner is all about?  The service was impeccable. We never had to ask for anything because he was so attentive.  The food was perfect.  The ribs, brisket and pulled pork are so tender and juicy with an abundance of flavor. The mac and cheese was so creamy. The deviled eggs had a bite of crunch on top and were so yummy! Who knew deviled eggs could be THAT good?!  Their brisket burger is ridiculous. \n\nThe only tiny recommendation I could make is that no BBQ place is complete without fried okra.  I think if they added this item to their menu, it would be complete. Also, only two cornbread as a side isn't really sufficient. Most places provide cornbread for each person.  That was the only con of our visit. \n\n Don't let the pricing worry you- you get plenty of QUALITY food for that price (and really it is only a few dollars more than chain places like Famous Dave's or Memphis BBQ) and we had left overs.  It was even better the next day. Great job to this establishment! We will definitely be back!"

The drink menu made it hard for us to choose with so many yummy choices. We choose the mint julep and pineapple lemonade cocktails. They were so good I stole the mint julep from my date. The burnt ends appetizer and bacon meatballs were enough for a meal and so flavorful. The dinner we decided to split the \"what's the beef with the chicken & the hog?\"  Talk about a lot of food, the flavors & meat were absolutely the best BBQ I have tasted. The sauces are perfectly suited for each meat. Our overall experience was 5 star plus. If you are looking for a night for cocktails & conversation this is the place to go."

There was a about two minute wait to be seated and we were impressed with the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant. Although we weren't wowed by the barbecue, the service and atmosphere will warrant a repeat trip in the future.\n\nJim was our server and he greeted us before we sat down. His attentiveness continued for the duration of the entire meal. The food runner also deserves some recognition. With the delivery of each dish, he provided a detailed description which included particulars about garnishes and side sauces. \n\nIf you're a whiskey drinker, you'll definitely appreciate their selection which is listed on the chalkboard and includes a very extensive list of bourbons not found in most bars. I could see myself sitting at the bar during happy hour sipping some of these whiskeys while snacking on happy hour food.\n\nWe started off with the deviled eggs ($6), shared the What's the Beef with the Chicken and the Hog ($35.98) as entree, and had the corn bread strawberry shortcake pound cake cookies ($6) for dessert. The entree was a portion of the brisket, chicken, and pulled pork with the candied yams and mac and cheese chosen as sides. I thought the pulled pork was the best of the three proteins served with a nice vinaigrette on the side. The brisket and the chicken were both overly dry with sauces that could not salvage them. Our pound cake was hard and dry for dessert.\n\nOn another day, we'll give the chicken or brisket another shot and maybe with a combo that includes ribs."

            "review": "Okay, let's get this out front- American BBQ is back, in several incarnations. Probably the most ubiquitous lately has been the mash-up of Asian (mostly Korean) spices and ingredients and some traditional urban cooking methods (braising, pressure cooking, etc.) with a decent dose of traditional smoking thrown in,  but smoked meats (and cheeses) have been popping up in unexpected venues for several years now. Too many smoke purists are too stodgy about their favorite traditions and style to see much beyond that which they personally prefer, and BBQ strikes close to the hearts of many culinarians, causing even the most professionally objective to openly cast aspersions on other legitimate styles and traditions.\n\nThat being said- let's talk about Pot Liquor. It's in a decent enough and accessible location, and it's nicely appointed, if a bit echoey (probably could have partitioned the space a bit more, including a PDR with some custom features), it's got a nice big bar (big plus for this elbow bender), and pretty nice beer and whiskey selection. Service is friendly and attentive and thorough in explaining the menu. An on to that-\n\nThis is a bit of a traditionalist's BBQ temple featuring very high quality sauces from KC to East Carolina (vinegar-based), some old timey roadhouse favorites and comfort food and French country bistro (the not-to-be-missed boudin noir) thrown in for good measure.\n\nAs a starter, I chose the burnt ends, and, although serviceable, they didn't exactly impress. Sure they were smoky, and they had a bit of caramelized crust to them, but they lacked the serious \"bark\" that all pit masters should know how to produce. They were a bit on the cold side as well. I'm guessing they're using a cook-and-hold method that isn't really gittin' 'er done. The 'cue sauce (#2, I think), though was great. Don't get me wrong, the smoky brisket itself was good, but the indulgence of good burnt ends is all about that tender smokiness fronted by a seriously crusty bark. They serve these up with \"Pullman Loaf\" which is just white bread, the traditional mop for tomato-based BBQ sauce, and some simply killer pickles.\n\nFrom there we had a nice selection of items- the Carolina pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, baby backs, some Boudin Noir, and brisket. First- the not-too great- both styles of ribs lacked the light crust that all good ribs should have guarding their near fall-off-the-bone tenderness, which, come to think of it, these also lacked, only just a bit. Many smoke heads argue that ribs should be a little firm and stick to the bone, but I've found the super-tender, near-melting meaty types tend to exhibit more depth of flavor. That aside- again, the KC and Texas sauces were spot-on exemplary with these. Speaking of Texas- on to the brisket. Brisket, in Texas, is the meat all BBQ chefs are judged by, and let's just say, if this was Austin, they'd need to argue for a do-over. While the pink smoke ring was apparent, and the meat nicely infused with smoke, it took good doses of the various sauces (and the collard greens' pot liquor) to impart any moisture. Properly smoked brisket will still ooze juice, but again, the killer sauces gussied it up nicely.\n\nAs for the good stuff- the Carolina pork is amazing- perfectly cooked, shredded, and perfectly matched to the East Carolina vinegar-based 'cue sauce. I also delighted in letting the pot liquor from the collard greens drip into the pile between bites. This is seriously addictive, yummy (super-yummy) stuff. Equal to it in many ways, but distinctly different was the Boudin Noir. It came with grilled prawns, which were expertly executed- firm but still juicy with nice caramelization, and a great celery-onion-orange slaw. All the flavors worked together as brilliant culinary composition, and the Boudin Noir is exquisite. The casing crackles and the interior is flaky-crumbly and moist. Another example of culinary crack. The Louisiana hot links were very well executed as well, with firm \"poppy\" casings and moist deliciousness therein.\n\nThe sides that really \"wowed\" were the kale-cashew slaw and the collard greens. The slaw is actually more slaw than kale, but is perfectly balanced, and not only are the chopped bits of cashew obvious, the night I went, the whole salad was redolent of the faintly sweet-nutty legume, as if the dressing was infused with cashew. The collard greens, like the Carolina pulled pork and Boudin Noir, are can't miss. Simmered in the namesake pot liquor, they literally drip with flavor.\n\nService, on the whole was pretty good, although at one point before I ordered, both bartenders got their backs to one side of the L-shaped bar talking with a couple- which is fine, but all good bartenders' heads should be on about a fifteen to twenty second swivel.\n\nAll in all, given the crack-addictive nature of several of the menu items, I will most definitely return, and I'll happily check to see if they've made progress on their brisket and rib items."

We heard some mixed things about the food, but the drinks looked so good! It's a big space with 2 giant mason jar chandeliers, lots of potential. The place was fairly empty, but it was a Tuesday afternoon. We arrived right in time for Happy Hour, 25% off of your entire check was a great deal. We decided on drinks right away, I had the cloud 9 and it was delicious. In fact, I was pretty impressed with all of the drinks that we ordered, they weren't overly boozy, but they weren't weak either. We decided to just have a few appetizers and dessert. \n\nWe started with the pork belly and country grits. I wasn't a huge fan of this, it wasn't super flavorful but the grits weren't terrible. I took a bite or two and moved on. We couldn't resist ordering the burnt ends, but again I found them disappointing. The piece I had was almost all fat and I ended up spitting it out. I then turned my attention to the pulled pork sliders which were OK, nothing crazy good, but definitely one of the better things on the table. We also ordered a side of fries and mac and cheese. I found the mac and cheese to be greasy and the cheddar was too sharp. It did have a nice crust on top, but just wasn't that great. I liked the fries, but it's hard to mess up fries. They were served with a side of Alabama white sauce, which was basically mayonnaise with a spicy component, not a bad dip for the fries. The last side to hit our table was the corn bread. Again, it wasn't terrible, but a little dry and not super flavorful.\n\nDespite the meal, we decided to try a couple desserts because it was happy hour and they sounded so good. We got the strawberry shortcake sandwiches which were again just OK. I found the biscuits to be dense and flavorless, but the strawberry ice cream was surprisingly delicious. We also settled on the fried banana split and it was definitely the low point of the meal. The bananas were corn flake covered and fried to the point of no return, they were brown on the inside and everything about them was burnt. The sundae itself just wasn't that good and I thought it was pretty hard to mess up a sundae! \n\nIt wasn't just the food, the service was also weird. At one point the manager interrupted our server as he was taking our order to question him about another table, which was really rude and unprofessional. It was clear that our server wasn't passionate about serving or customer service. He was awkward and even commented on how much we ordered, which was weird because we didn't order a ton for 3 people and the more we order the bigger the tip. At the end of our meal we waited a good 10 minutes for him to run our credit cards. He was having a conversation with some other servers/managers with our cards in his hand, it was really frustrating. When he came back to our table he started a conversation with us about the Dodgers because my friend's credit card had a Dodgers logo on it. It came out that he used to play for the Dodgers, which is really cool. I think in the end the entire staff needs more training and professional development. The food was bland and just missed the mark. I would definitely skip this place and visit one of the many other food establishments at Town Square."

Three people got the wrong order but they would only replace one as they claimed  the other  two were correct/  The ones that were served were baby back ribs  with a dry rub.  The ones ordered were Baby Back ribs with a mop sauce.  When the bill came there was an error.  We were charged for a side dish that was supposed to be included with the meal.  After 20 minutes of trying to get the bill corrected we eventually gave up and paid the bill.  \nThe manager that evening was rude and arrogant.  When we were talking with the server he butted in and wanted to know what we were talking about and he was told that this was a private conversation that didn't involve him to which he responded \"This is my restaurant and I can get involved if I want.\"\nThe quality of the food ws no better than many of the other BBQ restaurants."

            "review": "When you think of Las Vegas dining you think celebrity chefs, steak houses and buffets. The one thing you may not be thinking about in the middle of the desert is southern barbecue; but if you are, you should be thinking Pot Liquor Contemporary American Smokehouse.\n\nATMOSPHERE: 5 out of 5\n\nAs soon as you walk into the restaurant you know you're in a smokehouse. Aside from the aroma of burning wood lofting throughout the dining room, the hardwood pub height tables, the mason-jar chandler and the wall painting of a pig let you know that you are not at Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. \n\nFOOD: 4 out of 5\n\nI looked at this menu for days, everything that you can think of when your think southern BBQ is on it: Pork Belly Grits, House Made Pork Rinds, Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork... it's the Disney World of barbecue. On the back of the menu there was an extensive bar menu which included a rather impressive bourbon selection.  There were so many options that I was undecided right up until our server took my order and what I really wanted wasn't listed on the menu; however he allowed me to substitute. I ordered Beef Brisket, Memphis Style Ribs, Signature Collard Greens and Corn Bread. I will preface with I enjoyed the food and I would certainly return, however I did have a few highs and lows when it came to food quality. \n\nAs I mentioned the food was really good, Memphis Style Ribs were by far the highlight of what I had ordered. There was just the right amount of smoke and the meat was tender giving just enough chew to pull off the bone; they were delicious. The brisket however fell a little short and was dry. The smoke and flavors were good, perhaps brining them prior to smoking would help it retain moisture.  I enjoyed the collard greens, however from a personal standpoint I would have liked a little more heat and some acidity in the dish. The cornbread was perfect, it had great flavor and wasn't too heavy. It was flakey and light - the only suggestion I could make it that cornbread is always better with pieces of corn in it. \n\n\nSERVICE: 4 out of 5\n\nOur server was Paulie. I am guessing Paulie wasn't born in Nevada as his accent has a slight (that's sarcasm) touch of New York in there. He was quick to recognize the table, personable and went above and beyond to assist the group.  He even gave me a quick tour of the kitchen and introduced me to the owners before I left. \n\nOne of the things that impressed me with Paulie was that if he didn't know the answer to your question, he quickly found an answer for you.  The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars for service is because with a table of 20, Paulie should have had another server with him to assist guests. From a business standpoint this could have increased liquor sales improving profitability and from a customer's view its extra attention and increased service. \n\n\nPRICE:  4 out of 5\n\nIn comparison to many of the other restaurants in the area and considering the portion sizes, this is a very affordable location.  Taking a closer look at the menu, I would even say for what you are getting, the menu is priced just right. \n\nI didn't give them 5 stars because of the market price on some of the specialty drinks. Let's face it, this is Vegas and things aren't what they used to be out here. However $89 for a pour of Orphan Barrel \"Forged Oak\" exceeds the price I paid for the entire bottle ($80). That kind of markup is too pricy, even for Vegas. \n\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4 out of 5\n\nTruth be known, even with the couple negatives I experienced, I was a kid in a candy store. This is exactly the kind of experience I was anticipating and the Pot Liquor CAS lived up to my picky pallet. I would love to see something like this in my home state, although if it were in my home town I would weigh 400 pounds.  I wish them much success and next time I am in Vegas, they will see me again."

My husband and I split the platter that has brisket, half chicken(opted for the all white meat) and pulled pork. It came with 2 sides he chose collard green and Mac and cheese...we also added corn bread and a side of hot links.\nFood came out promptly it was Luke warm at best and most of the meats were dried...we sent it back and they warmed it up. Mac and cheese was ok and the greens had no flavor...corn bread was the best part of my meal.\nThey have 4 BBQ sauces none of them very good at all....also there was no bbq smoke flavor...they said they smoke their meats low and slow...but by the dried out grill marks from the chicken...I don't think so.\nSorry we won't be back....very disappointed."

I ordered a half order of brisket and it was about 5 bites of meat and the rest fat.....a generous helping of fat....for $20.  The sides did nothing to redeem them. The mac and cheese was bland and not very cheesy.  The potato salad was hard chunks of undercooked potatoes. It was so bad I didn't even take any leftovers to give my dog. The presentation was great, but really...who cares when you can't eat it.  To top it off it was my birthday dinner with friends. Had I not wanted to make a scene in front of them i would have sent the food back. The sweet tea wasn't sweet and was watered down. Really horrible birthday experience. Next time it's gonna be Famous Dave's or Lucille's. Overpriced and overrated....big disappointment!!! Epic fail!!!"

The General Manager Francis and another manager Ricky stopped by and made sure everything was to our liking. It's nice to have a place where it seems like everyone is there to make your time special and make you feel like you are important and that your hard earned money is well spent.

My office is right around the corner from Town Square, so based on my excellent experience on Saturday, I decided t grab some burnt ends for lunch. What I ended up getting isn't actually burnt ends, it's just cubed brisket. There's really no bark, and it appears that it's just thick center-cut brisket. Burnt ends are supposed to come from the tip of the brisket and be smoked longer, resulting in a thick, smoky bark.  What I was served today is NOTHING like what I was served 4 days ago.  I really can't stomach the price when the food is so inconsistent.  When they're good, they're actually pretty great, but now that 2/3 visits have ended in disappointment I just don't know if I'll be back."

If you are going to have such a large menu of Whisky you really should know the proper was to make whisky drinks. You also need to make sure everyone's drinks are full and by full I don't mean full of ICE. I ordered an old fashion the flavor was off the glass was over flowing with ice and still the level of my drink was half the glass. I understand there are proper amounts that need to be mixed together to make the drink the right way but when done right with the proper amount of ice it should still be over half the glass. \n\nThis will be the last time I go to this spot but I'm sure they won't make it very much longer."

Check the pictures to make sure. I did add a couple of pictures. The service was slow & we were forgotten about more than just a few times. But we were given free cornbread for our troubles. Well, they can forget about my table anytime if it means free cornbread. Oooowe! This cornbread is exceptionally good! I give P.L. four stars. You have got to try this."

We ended up ordering lunch from there when it opened, and I have been there for dinner since. I was disappointed in the food, but the drinks were AMAZING!\n\nAmbiance - I feel like they are trying to make it a gastropub BBQ joint. It definitely is unique. The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly.\n\nFood - I ordered the Texas Dip when I went there for lunch. The beef was tender and juicy, but the sandwich was loaded with a cream. I think it was mayo, which I was not a fan of. I feel like it ruined the sandwich. However, the fries were scrumptious. I would definitely go back for those. They were crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. I had the chicken pot pie when I went there for dinner. It was okay, nothing special. \n\nDrinks - The Southern Belle is by far my favorite. If you like sweet tea - it will be right up your alley. \n\nI will go back for happy hour, but probably not for a meal."

We came with the Fam and ordered the Lord Have Mercy which has 1/2 smoked chicken, 6 bones baby back ribs, 6 bones spareribs, Carolina pulled pork, 4 Louisiana hot links.  It comes with 3 sides and we added a couple more.  I love me some sides.  We got Mac N Cheese, Corn Bread, Cabot Grits, Mellowed Candied Yams and Fries w/ Alabama White Sauce.  The Lord Have Mercy is a lot of food!  The meat and sides were great.  There were a few things that while were still good, weren't what I was expecting.  I thought the Alabama white sauce was going to be a white BBQ sauce like they have in the south but it seemed like it was just a side of mayo.  The Cabot Grits tasted like regular grits, I thought they were going to be cheesy.  Not a big deal but I was a little disappointed.  Service was good, food took awhile but was worth the wait.  They have a great all day happy hour on Tuesdays, 25% off the entire menu and you do not have to sit at the bar!"

We made a reservation for 6pm since it was a Saturday night and based on what I heard I figured this place would be packed. Wrong! The place was empty. Our server was somewhat attentive but he seemed very preoccupied and out of it. I ordered the half a chicken with green beans and mac n' cheese. When it came out I was completely surprised to see that half of chicken was incredibly small (more like a cornish game hen). Also the corn muffin was about half a size of a real muffin (if you want extra they charge you $1.25). The sides were extremely good but the entire meal was definitely not worth the $18.99 charged. My friends ordered brisket and ribs. Both were good sizes and tasted good. While we were still in the middle of our meal (nowhere near finished) our waiter asked us if we wanted dessert (as if he was trying to rush us out, even though the place was empty). My friend wanted to order something else as we were still eating and not ready for dessert. Next thing we know we have our bills, even though we were once again still eating. My friend wanted to order some mac n cheese to go so the waiter took the bill back. We also asked to see a dessert menu (as we were finally done eating) and for some to go boxes. He brought over the dessert menu but we really didn't see anything we wanted (only a few things on it) plus we already had our checks. After that our waiter disappeared. We asked someone else to bring us wipes (since our waiter was nowhere to be found). We also had to ask for boxes several times. When we finally paid the bill we noticed they charged us 20% tip automatically. I know most places put an 18% tip automatically for a group over 6 but 20% especially for the service we received. We were not happy!! I don't think I would make another trip back here to bring my husband. I'd rather go elsewhere."

I didn't actually know about this place until my company beckoned us towards that direction. I was surprised because it's easily missed as Crazy Pita was right next to it. Still, I'm impressed by the whole thing! \n\nWe opted for the full plate of beef brisket and shared! Thank goodness that we did because I didn't actually think that it was a lot of food! I wasn't super hungry so sharing was a must at that point! They had so many things to choose from but one of the must-haves are their favorites! \n\nBeef brisket: delicious and tender to an extent. There was some parts when it felt a bit dry and rubbery but that's when the BBQ dipping sauce helped. I felt that it was like this around the middle of the meat but the sides were a delight. Nonetheless, ask for more than one dipping sauce when you're going for a full plate! Still a must-try when you're here.\n\nGrilled Corn Succotash: I like the idea, but I'm not a fan of this side. It wasn't cooked enough for me to enjoy it, and the additional chickpeas was just a tad confusing. Again, if the whole thing was cooked thoroughly, maybe I might've enjoyed a bit more. Also, I think they relied on the butter to give it flavor but it didn't seem to have gone towards that direction because the plate tasted bland. \n\nMac and Cheese: one of my favorites here. I love the balance of cheese with the macaroni. Or should I say, they overdid it? Still, I like my macaroni cheesy, and cheesy was what I got! Inside all macaroni was cheese oozing out of it! Ah! To this day, I'm still thinking about it! \n\nService: it was impressive! My water was filled when needed, and everything I needed was provided. My server was all around friendly to the point that you might just come back because of his welcoming demeanor. I really which they had more servers like him everywhere else."

They have a number of beers on tap, and a fair selection of hard alcohol.\n\nNow the bad...\n- Service was strange.  Our waiter was competent, but not very friendly.  He seemed rather tired, and was responsible for a lot of tables.  So, I can't really blame him for that... but it did negatively affect our visit. \n- The food took a LONG time to arrive.  I consider myself a rather patient person, but I think 45 minutes for an entree is a LONG time...  \n\nFinally, the GREAT...\n- Ribs were probably the best I've ever had.  They weren't super juicy and fall off the bone, but the flavor was magnificent.  It was the perfect combination of smoky-sweet-savory that is surprisingly redeeming after waiting 45 minutes for an entree.  Portions are generous, but I almost think that's a given with BBQ.\n- Chicken Pot Pie: I reluctantly ordered this after being let down by many chicken pot pies in the past, and was PLEASANTLY surprised.  The chicken was tender, juicy, and FLAVORFUL.  Also highly redeeming after a long wait.\n\nMaybe we caught them on an off day service-wise, or something, but we'll definitely be back for another visit."

The pulled pork and waffles was particularly impressive. We did also try the bacon steak, which is really more like a slice of pork belly. We will probably skip that one next time and go for the chicken fried steak instead. \n\nService was a bit slow, as I'm not sure they were adequately staffed, but everyone was polite and friendly.

The server was nice enough to let us know that there was a 25 percent off special going on tuesdays. \n\nMy boy friend and I ordered the deviled eggs and shared a combo plate. The deviled eggs were tasty with like these crunchy chicken things on top. The combo plate included two kinds of ribs, hot links, and choice of two sides. The mopped up ribs were really good and flavorful, whereas the dry rub were just ok. Hot links were good too. We chose mac and cheese and side of corn bread for our sides. The corn bread was absolutely fantastic. Mac and cheese was ehh. \n\nSo why the 3 stars? Well our server and the rest of the staff just seemed to be in panic mode. Initially when he took our orders, it seemed like he was having a hard time using their tablet system. They kept forgetting to refill our drinks. One of our friends had lemonade and he came back with sweet tea and said \"Please tell me you like sweet tea, because we are out of lemonade.\" He brought us to go boxes that were too small to fit those huge dry rub ribs. Then when it came time to pay it seemed to have even flustered them more. It was like a 30 minute ordeal to pay. \nAnd of course we were late for the movie. I wish they just had more of a sense of urgency.\n\nThe food was good and we will come back to give it another try."

We came today at lunch, about 12:30, to a very empty restaurant, which I now understand. We ordered the pork rinds, which were great, and that's where it ends! When our food came out, my order was wrong, but when I called it to the servers attention, he started arguing with me telling me that I ordered what he brought out. He even went as far as pulling out his iPad and showing me his mistake and telling me that I ordered it. Food? Meh!! As I said, the fresh made pork rinds are great! The BBQ, however, was pretty unexciting! I've actually had better bbq from Albertson's deli. I understand that the rent is probably pretty high at Town Square, but their prices are ridiculously high! If you want good bbq, don't waste your time or money here, Vegas has a lot better bbq offerings than this place! Such a let down!"

            "review": "I stopped by with some friends for a Sunday brunch.  The brunch has 4 menu options with unlimited bloody marts or mimosas for $19.99.  Not bad.\n\nStarted with the burnt ends appetizer.  They were pretty decent.  \n\nI ordered the brisket hash and eggs.  The brisket hash was ok, but I order basted eggs and I got close to hard boiled eggs.  Don't put eggs on a menu, unless you have someone who is good at it.  Small portions on the brunch menu.  I tried the country fried steak and gravy...  That was not good.  Super salty super thin cut of super chewy steak.  The gravy was salty, it seemed like it was made with ham instead of sausage.  The gravy was not creamy it was more pasty.  The pulled pork and waffles were ok. \n\nI was put off by the server not asking us if we wanted a refill.  He could plainly see our empty drinks, but we had to ask for refills every time.  \n\nYou might want to check out the BBQ items instead of the brunch, it just wasn't good.    At that price it was kinda worth it because of the drinks, but if you are going to offer brunch - make it taste good."
